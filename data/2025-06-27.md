### [1] [The Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20702)
*Yoshua Bengio,Tegan Maharaj,Luke Ong,Stuart Russell,Dawn Song,Max Tegmark,Lan Xue,Ya-Qin Zhang,Stephen Casper,Wan Sie Lee,Sören Mindermann,Vanessa Wilfred,Vidhisha Balachandran,Fazl Barez,Michael Belinsky,Imane Bello,Malo Bourgon,Mark Brakel,Siméon Campos,Duncan Cass-Beggs,Jiahao Chen,Rumman Chowdhury,Kuan Chua Seah,Jeff Clune,Juntao Dai,Agnes Delaborde,Nouha Dziri,Francisco Eiras,Joshua Engels,Jinyu Fan,Adam Gleave,Noah Goodman,Fynn Heide,Dan Hendrycks,Cyrus Hodes,Bryan Low Kian Hsiang,Minlie Huang,Sami Jawhar,Wang Jingyu,Adam Tauman Kalai,Meindert Kamphuis,Mohan Kankanhalli,Subhash Kantamneni,Mathias Bonde Kirk,Thomas Kwa,Jeffrey Ladish,Kwok-Yan Lam,Wan Lee Sie,Taewhi Lee,Xiaojian Li,Jiajun Liu,Chaochao Lu,Yifan Mai,Richard Mallah,Julian Michael,Nick Moës,Simon Möller,Kihyuk Nam,Kwan Yee Ng,Mark Nitzberg,Besmira Nushi,Seán O hÉigeartaigh,Alejandro Ortega,Pierre Peigné,James Petrie,Benjamin Prud'Homme,Reihaneh Rabbany,Nayat Sanchez-Pi,Sarah Schwettmann,Buck Shlegeris,Saad Siddiqui,Aradhana Sinha,Martín Soto,Cheston Tan,Dong Ting,Robert Trager,Brian Tse,Anthony Tung K. H.,Vanessa Wilfred,John Willes,Denise Wong,Wei Xu,Rongwu Xu,Yi Zeng,HongJiang Zhang,Djordje Žikelić*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights a Singapore-based conference that sought to support AI safety research by uniting global experts and organizing research into three domains: Development, Assessment, and Control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the urgent need for ensuring AI trustworthiness, reliability, and security in light of rapid advancements in AI capabilities and autonomy.

Method: Hosting an international conference in Singapore and synthesizing insights from global AI safety experts, leveraging the defense-in-depth model to structure research domains.

Result: The report identifies and categorizes AI safety challenges into Development, Assessment, and Control, contributing to a global research framework.

Conclusion: A collaborative and structured approach is essential for advancing AI safety, fostering public trust, and maximizing innovation.

Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of
transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI
is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem
is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives
maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific
Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing
together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research
priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI
Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By
adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research
domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems
(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and
challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

### [2] [MAGPIE: A dataset for Multi-AGent contextual PrIvacy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20737)
*Gurusha Juneja,Alon Albalak,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the contextual privacy capabilities of LLM-based agents during multi-turn conversations using a new benchmark called MAGPIE. Results show these models lack robust privacy awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores whether LLM-based agents can preserve privacy in high-stakes, multi-turn collaborative tasks, given the increasing importance of inter-agent systems accessing sensitive data.

Method: Introduced the MAGPIE benchmark with 158 scenarios across 15 domains that require balancing task success and privacy. Conducted empirical evaluations on models like GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet.

Result: Current LLMs misclassify private data as shareable in a significant number of cases (25.2% and 43.6%). In multi-turn conversations, they disclose private information 59.9% and 50.5% of the time. Multi-agent setups fail tasks 71% of the time.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are not equipped to handle contextual privacy or perform collaborative tasks effectively in privacy-sensitive scenarios, necessitating better alignment and model improvements.

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

### [3] [Dynamic Context-Aware Prompt Recommendation for Domain-Specific AI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20815)
*Xinye Tang,Haijun Zhai,Chaitanya Belwal,Vineeth Thayanithi,Philip Baumann,Yogesh K Roy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new system for generating high-quality, domain-specific prompts for AI applications is proposed, using dynamic context-aware recommendations and hierarchical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crafting high-quality prompts for domain-specific applications is difficult and essential for effective LLM performance.

Method: The paper introduces a system that uses contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking to generate prompts.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed system produces highly relevant and useful prompt suggestions, confirmed by automated and expert evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances prompt generation quality, leveraging dynamic systems and advanced techniques like few-shot learning and hierarchical reasoning.

Abstract: LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user
prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially
for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic
context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications.
Our solution combines contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge
grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking to
generate relevant and actionable prompt suggestions.
  The system leverages behavioral telemetry and a two-stage hierarchical
reasoning process to dynamically select and rank relevant skills, and
synthesizes prompts using both predefined and adaptive templates enhanced with
few-shot learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated
and expert evaluations.

### [4] [Beyond Reactive Safety: Risk-Aware LLM Alignment via Long-Horizon Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20949)
*Chenkai Sun,Denghui Zhang,ChengXiang Zhai,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate the societal impact of language models by simulating long-term implications and testing safety awareness on a new harm scenarios dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rising use of language models in critical societal decisions and to ensure they align with long-term safety considerations.

Method: The authors introduce a framework to simulate the propagation of model-generated advice and a new dataset that examines models' ability to predict indirect harms. They also conduct benchmarking tests against existing safety datasets.

Result: The proposed method improved performance by over 20% on the new dataset, achieving a win rate of over 70% against strong baselines in safety evaluation.

Conclusion: This framework and dataset show potential in advancing safer, more robust alignment of language models with long-term societal impact considerations.

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks
(AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer
agents.

### [5] [Unveiling Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: Reality or Mirage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21215)
*Haoang Chi,He Li,Wenjing Yang,Feng Liu,Long Lan,Xiaoguang Ren,Tongliang Liu,Bo Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the causal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) and introduces a method, G²-Reasoner, to enhance their depth in causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of LLMs only being capable of shallow, level-1 causal reasoning and to explore pathways for achieving human-like level-2 causal reasoning.

Method: The researchers studied the autoregressive mechanism of LLMs to analyze their casual reasoning capabilities and introduced a benchmark, CausalProbe-2024, for evaluation. They then proposed G²-Reasoner, a method that uses general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts to improve LLMs’ reasoning.

Result: LLMs showed significant performance drops on the novel benchmark (CausalProbe-2024), highlighting their level-1 causal reasoning limitations. However, with G²-Reasoner, their causal reasoning performance improved considerably, especially in fresh and counterfactual scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs currently lack human-like level-2 causal reasoning, but incorporating goal-oriented structures and general knowledge (via G²-Reasoner) can enhance their capabilities and offer a pathway towards advanced causal reasoning.

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

### [6] [World-aware Planning Narratives Enhance Large Vision-Language Model Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21230)
*Junhao Shi,Zhaoye Fei,Siyin Wang,Qipeng Guo,Jingjing Gong,Xipeng QIu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the World-Aware Planning Narrative Enhancement (WAP) framework to improve Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for embodied planning tasks by equipping them with better environmental understanding and cognitive capabilities. Their method achieves notable success rates on challenging benchmarks, even outperforming top proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models face difficulties in handling complex and unfamiliar environments during multi-step, context-sensitive planning tasks, necessitating a method for better embedding environmental contexts.

Method: The WAP framework integrates four cognitive capabilities—visual appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic grounding—training models through curriculum learning using raw visual data.

Result: The proposed approach achieves significant improvements on the EB-ALFRED benchmark, with metrics like commonsense reasoning and long-horizon planning improving by as much as 60.0 and 70.0, respectively. Enhanced open-source models even outperform GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet.

Conclusion: Adopting the WAP framework results in substantial advancements in LVLMs' ability to handle context-sensitive, long-horizon planning tasks, setting a new performance standard for both open-source and proprietary systems.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

### [7] [IXAII: An Interactive Explainable Artificial Intelligence Interface for Decision Support Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21310)
*Pauline Speckmann,Mario Nadj,Christian Janiesch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an interactive system, IXAII, which combines multiple explainable AI methods and customizes explanations for diverse users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of user-centric and interactive explainability in existing AI explanation methods, which limits their effectiveness for diverse audiences.

Method: Developed IXAII, an interactive system integrating LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE to offer tailored explanations and visualization options for distinct user groups.

Result: Interviews with experts and lay users demonstrated that IXAII enhances transparency and usability through its interactive, multi-method explanation features.

Conclusion: IXAII bridges the gap between static AI explanations, user interactivity, and practical implementation, offering a new perspective on human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,
most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness
for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable
intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable
AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored
views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on
AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

### [8] [Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21329)
*Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in AI for scientific discovery and proposes an architecture addressing gaps in abstraction, reasoning, and reality for improved integration with real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the advancements in AI, its application in scientific discovery is restricted by operational architectures, inadequate reasoning capabilities, and poor integration with experimental reality.

Method: The paper suggests an architecture for AI systems featuring causal self-supervised models, Bayesian-guided planners, evolving knowledge graphs, and closed-loop interaction with simulators and laboratories to improve reasoning and causal understanding.

Result: The proposed architecture bridges abstraction, reasoning, and reality gaps, enabling AI to engage in counterfactual reasoning and empirical validation for scientific progress.

Conclusion: The authors emphasize the need for AI systems to integrate counterfactual reasoning with real-world validation and argue for retaining human judgment as a permanent component due to ambiguities and uncertainties.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

### [9] [TableMoE: Neuro-Symbolic Routing for Structured Expert Reasoning in Multimodal Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21393)
*Junwen Zhang,Pu Chen,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts model, tackles complex multimodal table scenarios and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with robust reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve multimodal table understanding, addressing challenges of structural complexity and visual degradation that existing models struggle with.

Method: TableMoE employs Neuro-Symbolic Routing to assign roles to table elements and routes them dynamically to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML, Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code), supported by symbolic reasoning graphs. Pretraining uses a newly introduced TableMoE-Align dataset.

Result: Experiments show TableMoE's superior performance over existing models on four challenging WildStruct benchmarks and validate the core components' contributions through ablation studies.

Conclusion: TableMoE effectively enhances structured reasoning for multimodal tables, proving the value of neuro-symbolic methods in addressing real-world table complexities.

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

### [10] [Spatial Mental Modeling from Limited Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21458)
*Baiqiao Yin,Qineng Wang,Pingyue Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Kangrui Wang,Zihan Wang,Jieyu Zhang,Keshigeyan Chandrasegaran,Han Liu,Ranjay Krishna,Saining Xie,Manling Li,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MindCube benchmark to test vision language models' ability to imagine unseen spatial environments, proposing techniques that significantly improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address a critical gap in Vision Language Models (VLMs) which fail in forming spatial mental models to reason about unseen spaces.

Method: The study evaluates VLMs using the MindCube benchmark and explores methods like unseen views, reasoning chains, and cognitive maps, proposing a synergistic "map-then-reason" approach combined with reinforcement learning.

Result: Accuracy of VLMs improved from 37.8% to 60.8% using the "map-then-reason" approach, and further increased to 70.7% with reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Active construction and utilization of spatial mental models through structured reasoning significantly enhance VLMs' understanding of unseen spaces.

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

### [11] [Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21490)
*Tin Dizdarević,Ravi Hammond,Tobias Gessler,Anisoara Calinescu,Jonathan Cook,Matteo Gallici,Andrei Lupu,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses AH2AC2, a novel challenge for human-AI coordination using human proxy agents in the card game Hanabi. It aims to overcome the difficulty of human evaluation and provides a dataset and baseline results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of seamless human-AI coordination in complex real-world scenarios, and to overcome the limitations of costly and hard-to-reproduce human evaluation in the card game Hanabi.

Method: The authors introduced Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) and developed human proxy agents trained on a 3,079-game dataset. The dataset is purposefully limited for promoting data-efficient methods. Proxy agents are hosted on a controlled system for fair evaluation.

Result: The paper establishes a benchmark for evaluating human-AI coordination using human proxy agents in Hanabi. Baseline results are presented for both two- and three-player scenarios.

Conclusion: The introduction of AH2AC2 and human proxy agents provides a scalable, reproducible solution for studying human-AI coordination, paving the way for more data-efficient approaches in AI development.

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

### [12] [Mind2Web 2: Evaluating Agentic Search with Agent-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21506)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mind2Web 2, a benchmark for evaluating agentic search systems with tasks requiring web browsing and information synthesis. It also presents a novel evaluation framework using tree-structured judge agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate the complexities and open-endedness of agentic search systems like Deep Research effectively.

Method: Mind2Web 2 benchmark was constructed with 130 realistic tasks and a tree-structured rubric-based Agent-as-a-Judge framework for automatic evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of nine systems shows OpenAI Deep Research achieves 50-70% of human performance in half the time.

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2 serves as a critical foundation for advancing and evaluating agentic search systems, addressing performance and efficiency challenges.

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while

*Fangjun Ding,Renyu Zhang,Xinyu Feng,Chengye Xie,Zheng Zhang,Yanting Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PsyLite, a lightweight AI-driven psychological counseling model designed with enhanced reasoning, counseling proficiency, and safety features, showing significant improvements in evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address deficiencies in dialogue safety, scenario handling, and resource-efficient deployment in AI-driven psychological counseling models.

Method: The PsyLite model was developed using InternLM2.5-7B-chat as a base and employed two-stage training (hybrid distillation and ORPO optimization), conditional RAG for humor integration, and quantization technology for efficiency.

Result: PsyLite significantly improved in psychological counseling professionalism (47.6%) and dialogue safety (2.4%) compared to baselines, while supporting deployment in resource-limited environments with only 5GB memory requirements.

Conclusion: PsyLite demonstrates efficacy in professional AI counseling with safety, humor integration, and lightweight deployment, making it suitable for broad applications in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.

*Ilias Papalamprou,Nikolaos Fotos,Nikolaos Chatzivasileiadis,Anna Angelogianni,Dimosthenis Masouros,Dimitrios Soudris*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a security solution for FPGAs used in edge networks by combining remote attestation, post-quantum cryptography, and blockchain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increase in edge services from 5G networks requires secure FPGAs, especially with vulnerabilities to quantum computing threats.

Method: The paper implements a hybrid hardware-software approach, employing remote attestation, PQC algorithms, and blockchain to configure FPGAs securely.

Result: Evaluations reveal that the proposed solution adds only a 2% overhead compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed system ensures secure FPGA configuration with minimal performance impact, supporting trustworthy edge computing environments.

Abstract: The advent of 5G and beyond has brought increased performance networks,
facilitating the deployment of services closer to the user. To meet performance
requirements such services require specialized hardware, such as Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, FPGAs are often deployed in
unprotected environments, leaving the user's applications vulnerable to
multiple attacks. With the rise of quantum computing, which threatens the
integrity of widely-used cryptographic algorithms, the need for a robust
security infrastructure is even more crucial. In this paper we introduce a
hybrid hardware-software solution utilizing remote attestation to securely
configure FPGAs, while integrating Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms
for enhanced security. Additionally, to enable trustworthiness across the whole
edge computing continuum, our solution integrates a blockchain infrastructure,
ensuring the secure storage of any security evidence. We evaluate the proposed
secure configuration process under different PQC algorithms in two FPGA
families, showcasing only 2% overheard compared to the non PQC approach.

### [15] [Accelerating GNN Training through Locality-aware Dropout and Merge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21414)
*Gongjian Sun,Mingyu Yan,Dengke Han,Runzhen Xue,Duo Wang,Xiaochun Ye,Dongrui Fan*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper proposes LiGNN, a hardware solution to enhance data locality and accelerate GNN training by using locality-aware dropout and memory merge techniques for neighbor aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The irregular connectivity in graph structures causes inefficient neighbor aggregation, leading to degraded model performance due to irregular DRAM accesses.

Method: The authors developed LiGNN, a hardware-based solution that employs locality-aware dropout and DRAM memory merge techniques at the row level during neighbor aggregation to improve data locality.

Result: LiGNN achieves a 1.48~3.02x speedup, reduces DRAM accesses by 34%~55%, and decreases DRAM row activations by 59%~82%, all while maintaining model accuracy.

Conclusion: LiGNN demonstrates significant performance improvements for GNN training by optimizing data access and memory efficiency without compromising the model's accuracy.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in graph
learning and are widely adopted across various critical domains. However, the
irregular connectivity between vertices leads to inefficient neighbor
aggregation, resulting in substantial irregular and coarse-grained DRAM
accesses. This lack of data locality presents significant challenges for
execution platforms, ultimately degrading performance. While previous
accelerator designs have leveraged on-chip memory and data access scheduling
strategies to address this issue, they still inevitably access features at
irregular addresses from DRAM. In this work, we propose LiGNN, a hardware-based
solution that improves data locality by applying dropout and merge techniques
during neighbor aggregation to accelerate GNN training. Unlike conventional
algorithm-level dropout methods that primarily aim to improve accuracy while
overlooking hardware costs, LiGNN introduces a locality-aware feature dropout
mechanism. This approach selectively drops node features with data locality
awareness, effectively reducing irregular DRAM accesses without compromising
model accuracy. Moreover, by leveraging detailed knowledge of memory layout and
organization-including critical alignment constraints-LiGNN strategically
merges memory accesses during neighbor aggregation at the DRAM row level,
guided by GNN-level semantics. This optimization significantly improves data
locality with minimal additional cost. Under the commonly adopted 0.5 dropout
rate, LiGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering a 1.48~3.02x
speedup, reducing DRAM accesses by 34%~55%, and lowering DRAM row activations
by 59%~82%, all while maintaining model accuracy.

*Maryam Ghane,Amir M. Hajisadeghi,Hamid R. Zarandi*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces OptGM, a gate merging method to tackle NBTI in circuits, showing significant reductions in delay degradation and transistor count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NBTI is a major reliability issue in digital circuits, causing delay degradation and impacting performance. The study aims to address this issue effectively.

Method: OptGM identifies NBTI-critical nodes and merges sensitizer and sensitive gates into a complex gate, eliminating critical nodes while maintaining circuit logic.

Result: OptGM reduces NBTI-critical transistors by 89.29%, delays by 23.87%, and transistor count by 6.47%, while increasing performance per cost by 12.8%.

Conclusion: OptGM proves to be an effective way to mitigate NBTI impacts with minimal area overhead and significant efficiency improvements.

Abstract: This paper presents OptGM, an optimized gate merging method designed to
mitigate negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) in digital circuits.
First, the proposed approach effectively identifies NBTI-critical internal
nodes, defined as those with a signal probability exceeding a predefined
threshold. Next, based on the proposed optimized algorithm, the sensitizer gate
(which drives the critical node) and the sensitive gate (which is fed by it)
are merged into a new complex gate. This complex gate preserves the original
logic while eliminating NBTI-critical nodes. Finally, to evaluate the
effectiveness of OptGM, we assess it on several combinational and sequential
benchmark circuits. Simulation results demonstrate that, on average, the number
of NBTI-critical transistors (i.e., PMOS transistors connected to critical
nodes), NBTI-induced delay degradation, and the total transistor count are
reduced by 89.29%, 23.87%, and 6.47%, respectively. Furthermore, OptGM enhances
performance per cost (PPC) by 12.8% on average, with minimal area overhead.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LUCARIO, a benchmark and framework for probabilistic question answering (QA) over large tables with Bayesian Networks and large language models (LLMs), showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NL2SQL systems are limited to factual QA and struggle with probabilistic questions requiring uncertainty reasoning.

Method: The approach involves constructing Bayesian Networks from tabular data, transforming natural language into probabilistic queries, and leveraging LLMs for answer generation.

Result: The framework achieves significant improvements in probabilistic QA accuracy compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Hybrid symbolic and neural reasoning offers enhanced capabilities for probabilistic QA over tabular data.

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [18] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes multi-lingual capabilities in large language models (LLMs) through new functional benchmarks, revealing discrepancies in model performance across languages and benchmark styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of multi-lingual competence in LLMs via static benchmarks fail to adequately assess practical performance and robustness across languages.

Method: The authors create two new functional benchmarks, CL-GSM Symbolic and CL-IFEval, by translating existing English templates into five other languages and analyze LLM performances across these benchmarks.

Result: The study finds significant performance drops when using the new benchmarks compared to static benchmarks, especially in multi-lingual settings, and reveals variability in robustness depending on the language.

Conclusion: Functional benchmarks provide a more nuanced understanding of LLM performance across languages, indicating room for improvement in multilingual robustness, especially in less-resourced languages.

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An experiment involving expert researchers executing LLM and human-generated research ideas found that while LLM ideas initially appear more novel, they perform worse post-execution, highlighting limitations in LLM idea generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness of LLMs in generating not just novel but also practical and impactful research ideas.

Method: 43 expert researchers were assigned either human-written or LLM-generated research ideas to execute, spending over 100 hours and documenting their work in 4-page short papers. These were blindly reviewed by expert NLP researchers for novelty, excitement, effectiveness, and overall quality.

Result: LLM-generated ideas scored lower than expert-written ones post-execution across all evaluation metrics, with significant drop in evaluation scores after execution compared to human ideas.

Conclusion: Current LLMs face challenges in producing truly effective and executable research ideas, emphasizing the need to evaluate ideas based on execution outcomes and not just perceived novelty.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

### [20] [MultiFinRAG: An Optimized Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework for Financial Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20821)
*Chinmay Gondhalekar,Urjitkumar Patel,Fang-Chun Yeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiFinRAG is a specialized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for financial question answering that improves multimodal reasoning by addressing token limitations and layout challenges, achieving 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional LLMs and RAG pipelines in handling long financial documents with diverse modalities like narrative text, tables, and figures, which require complex cross-modal reasoning.

Method: MultiFinRAG employs multimodal extraction using a lightweight LLM for structured outputs and summaries, modality-aware retrieval with similarity thresholds, and a tiered fallback strategy to enable refined cross-modal reasoning while limiting irrelevant context.

Result: MultiFinRAG significantly outperforms ChatGPT-4o in financial question answering, achieving a 19 percentage point increase in accuracy on tasks requiring multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG demonstrates that a tailored approach combining multimodal LLMs and modality-aware retrieval can efficiently handle cross-modal financial reasoning tasks, even on commodity hardware.

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

*Quintin Myers,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates six large language models' handling of morally ambiguous, real-world violent conflicts using the Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire, revealing discrepancies in their surface-level responses and internal violence tendencies, influenced by demographic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly proposed for moderating violent online content, but their ability to reason morally in complex real-world scenarios has not been thoroughly assessed.

Method: The researchers employed the Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ), a validated social science tool, and persona-based prompting to test six LLMs across a zero-shot setting, analyzing their responses based on race, age, and geographic persona variations.

Result: Findings show that LLM-generated text often deviates from their internal violent preferences, and their violent tendencies are influenced by demographic factors, which sometimes contradict established criminology and social science insights.

Conclusion: The study highlights the presence of demographic-based biases and discrepancies in LLMs' reasoning about violence, pointing to the need for more robust ethical design and evaluation frameworks for AI moderation systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines challenges in applying end-to-end fact-checking systems to medicine by studying how clinical experts verify claims and highlights fundamental issues with automated fact-checking in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the complexity of medical communication and decision-making, compounded by the inadequate medical literacy of the majority of users and the rise of misinformation in social media.

Method: The authors conducted a study where clinical experts verified real claims sourced from social media by synthesizing evidence from medical literature, aiming to understand the practical challenges of fact-checking in medicine.

Result: The study identified key challenges: difficulties linking claims to scientific evidence, ambiguities due to vague claims, mismatched intentions, and subjective nature of veracity labels.

Conclusion: The authors advocate for rethinking medical fact-checking as an interactive communication process rather than a fully automated end-to-end solution in order to address these challenges effectively.

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates novel methods to adapt language models (LMs) effectively to various tasks by leveraging unlabelled data, reducing computational costs, and enhancing fine-tuning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting language models efficiently and robustly to specific tasks is challenging due to issues like underutilization of unlabelled data, overfitting on small datasets, and high computational costs.

Method: The paper proposes novel continued pre-training strategies, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, improved supervised fine-tuning methods, and new evaluation benchmarks to enhance LM performance and adaptability.

Result: The proposed approaches improve LM robustness, efficiency, and generalization, validated across diverse NLP tasks such as open-ended generation and spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: The advancements significantly enhance the adaptability, scalability, and performance of LMs, contributing to the broader progress towards artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new pipeline for curating multilingual pre-training data for LLMs, resulting in a high-quality 20 TB dataset called FineWeb2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual LLMs face challenges due to the complexity of tailoring filtering and deduplication processes across numerous languages, unlike progress in English LLMs. Developing universally adaptable pipelines is critical.

Method: The authors propose an adaptive curation pipeline based on FineWeb, evaluated through extensive experiments on nine languages and novel task selection methods. They rebalance datasets by accounting for duplication and quality, then scale to 1000+ languages using Common Crawl data.

Result: The new pipeline generates better-performing multilingual LLMs compared to prior datasets, with an additional boost from the dataset rebalancing strategy. They create FineWeb2, a 20 TB dataset spanning 1000+ languages.

Conclusion: FineWeb2 and the accompanying pipeline demonstrate an effective, scalable approach for pre-training multilingual LLMs. These resources are publicly released to facilitate further research in this domain.

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KaLM-Embedding-V2, a compact yet powerful text embedding model outperforming larger models through innovative training and architecture design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a compact embedding model capable of competing with significantly larger models while retaining versatility and performance in text embeddings.

Method: The approach involves removing causal attention for better alignment, employing multi-stage training (pre-training, fine-tuning, parameter averaging), implementing focal-style reweighting for difficult samples, and enriching negatives through online hard-negative mixing.

Result: KaLM-Embedding-V2 significantly outperforms other models of similar size and competes with models up to 26x larger in benchmarks, particularly in Chinese and English, setting a high standard in compact embeddings.

Conclusion: A compact and versatile embedding model with less than 1B parameters can achieve outstanding performance, competing with much larger models through superior training techniques and architectural innovations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new

*Eric Zhang,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores a method to meta-train language models so that fine-tuning mimics the effects of prompting, using gradient-based meta-learning and the model's own predictions as targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the limitations of fine-tuning by enabling models to emulate the robust generalization and inference capabilities seen with prompting.

Method: The authors use gradient-based meta-learning, taking language model predictions made during prompting as training targets, and conducting fine-tuning for long-context improvements without requiring ground-truth labels.

Result: The proposed approach recovers much of the performance of prompting during gradient updates, including for tasks like 'reversal curse' and text passage questions, showing notable gains in expressiveness with gradient descent.

Conclusion: This method demonstrates the potential of gradient-based fine-tuning to improve long-context modeling while emphasizing the expressiveness of gradient descent for generalization.

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for more nuanced and controllable personality modeling in large language models (LLMs) by using the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model instead of the traditional Big Five framework, alongside a novel method for controlling trait intensity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to personality modeling in LLMs are limited as they rely on the Big Five framework, which provides only coarse personality dimensions, and lack mechanisms for controlling the intensity of traits.

Method: The authors extend the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) to incorporate the 16PF model and introduce the Specific Attribute Control (SAC) framework, which uses semantic anchoring and behavioral questions to control and evaluate the intensity of traits across factors like Frequency, Depth, Threshold, Effort, and Willingness.

Result: The approach results in more consistent and controllable personality expressions and shows that changing the intensity of one trait influences related traits in psychologically coherent ways, indicating that LLMs internalize multi-dimensional personality structures.

Conclusion: The study provides a significant advancement in creating human-like and controllable personality expressions in LLMs, enabling better applications in fields like healthcare, education, and interviewing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

*Papa Séga Wade,Mihai Andries,Ioannis Kanellos,Thierry Moudenc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a chunk-based approach using advanced self-supervised learning (SSL) models and a hierarchical CNN-BiLSTM framework to improve automatic fluency assessment (AFA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic fluency assessment faces challenges in accurately capturing rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speech, requiring innovative solutions for better temporal and prosodic analysis.

Method: The authors use a chunk-based segmentation approach with Silero voice activity detection. They integrate SSL models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, WavLM) through learnable weighted fusion and enrich embeddings with fluency markers for analysis. A CNN-BiLSTM model captures dependencies across speech chunks.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms SSL baselines and Pyannote.audio segmentation baselines, achieving significant gains in F1-score and Pearson correlation on two datasets, Avalinguo and Speechocean762.

Conclusion: The chunk-based multi-SSL fusion method demonstrates robust fluency assessment capabilities, though its generalization to dialects with irregular prosody remains an area for further research.

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CA-Ben, a benchmark for assessing LLMs on financial and legal reasoning using Indian CA exam datasets, revealing strengths and weaknesses of models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the uncertainty of how well large language models (LLMs) capture and apply financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning, especially in the Indian context.

Method: A benchmark named CA-Ben was developed, using datasets sourced from India's Chartered Accountancy exams (covering foundational to advanced levels), to evaluate six major LLMs based on standardized protocols.

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o demonstrated the best performance in conceptual and legal reasoning. However, challenges like numerical computation errors and difficulties in legal interpretation persist across models.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show promise in financial and legal reasoning but require improvements such as hybrid reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation for better numerical and legal task accuracy.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis
and accurate legal interpretation.

*Chunyuan Yuan,Chong Zhang,Zheng Fang,Ming Pang,Xue Jiang,Changping Peng,Zhangang Lin,Ching Law*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSUF, a novel framework to enhance query classification for e-commerce using knowledge, label semantics, and structural relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges such as short, context-less e-commerce queries and the inefficiency in unified query classification subtasks.

Method: SSUF incorporates three modules: knowledge-enhanced, label-enhanced, and structure-enhanced, to improve query representations via semi-supervised methods and pluggable features.

Result: Extensive offline and online A/B tests show SSUF significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art models in query classification.

Conclusion: SSUF offers a scalable and effective solution for unifying and optimizing e-commerce query classification subtasks.

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MT2-CSD, a large dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational stance detection, and proposes an advanced model, LLM-CRAN, which outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stance detection methods focus on isolated instances, failing to capture the dynamics of social media's multi-party discussions due to limited datasets.

Method: The authors created MT2-CSD, a large and in-depth dataset, and developed LLM-CRAN, combining Large Language Models with Conversational Relational Attention.

Result: LLM-CRAN achieved superior performance compared to baseline models on the MT2-CSD dataset.

Conclusion: The introduction of MT2-CSD and LLM-CRAN marks progress in stance detection, offering tools to improve understanding of multi-party conversational dynamics.

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

*Kang He,Yuzhe Ding. Haining Wang,Fei Li,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DALR, a model to improve sentence representation in multimodal settings by addressing misalignment and semantic divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus on coarse-level image-text alignment and fail to capture fine-grained semantics, leading to degraded sentence representation quality.

Method: The authors propose a dual-level alignment approach using consistency learning for cross-modal alignment and ranking distillation for intra-modal semantic structure.

Result: Experiments on STS and TR tasks show DALR outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DALR effectively enhances multimodal sentence representation by addressing key misalignment and semantic challenges.

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ComRAG, a framework for real-time Community Question Answering (CQA), which integrates static knowledge and historical interactions using a centroid-based memory mechanism, demonstrating significant performance and efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address challenges in leveraging dynamic historical interactions and domain knowledge effectively in real-time CQA platforms, while resolving issues related to underutilization of external knowledge, lack of memory mechanisms, and inefficiencies in industrial settings.

Method: The authors propose ComRAG, which employs a retrieval-augmented generation framework that combines static knowledge and dynamic historical QA context through a centroid-based memory mechanism, optimized for retrieval, generation, and storage.

Result: Evaluations on three industrial CQA datasets showed that ComRAG outperformed baselines with up to 25.9% improved vector similarity, reduced latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and significantly minimized storage growth from 20.23% to 2.06%.

Conclusion: ComRAG effectively integrates knowledge sources and dynamic interactions, delivering superior real-time CQA performance with improved efficiency, showing strong potential for industrial applications.

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Progtuning is a novel fine-tuning framework that progressively reduces updated transformer blocks while maintaining competitive performance, optimizing computation by saving 25% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency of existing fine-tuning methods that require updating all transformer model parameters without recognizing their unequal contributions.

Method: Progtuning selectively and progressively reduces updated transformer blocks based on their contribution, optimizing resource allocation.

Result: Progtuning reduces updated parameters by 25% and maintains competitive performance, while being adaptable to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: Progtuning enhances resource efficiency in fine-tuning processes, demonstrating adaptability and efficiency for large language models without compromising effectiveness.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

*Viacheslav Meshchaninov,Egor Chimbulatov,Alexander Shabalin,Aleksandr Abramov,Dmitry Vetrov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cosmos introduces a text generation method using diffusion models in compressed latent space, addressing limitations of autoregressive models and achieving faster inference with competitive quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language models are limited by slow decoding and global coherence challenges, while diffusion models face dimensionality issues for token-level text data.

Method: Cosmos utilizes a compressed and smooth latent space via an autoencoder. It combines token-level reconstruction with pretrained language encoder alignments to enable robust semantics and efficient augmentations for diffusion-based text generation.

Result: Cosmos achieves $8\times$ compression of text representations without sacrificing quality. It outperforms diffusion and autoregressive models on several tasks and is over $2\times$ faster in inference.

Conclusion: Cosmos provides a novel, efficient, and flexible approach to text generation leveraging diffusion models, demonstrating superior or comparable performance with significant gains in speed.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based model for turn-taking prediction in dialogue systems, controllable via dynamic textual prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve turn-taking prediction in spoken dialogue systems with intuitive and adaptive control mechanisms.

Method: A transformer-based Voice Activity Projection (VAP) model enhanced with textual prompt embeddings. Synthetic prompts were generated using a language model for training.

Result: The model improved prediction accuracy and successfully adapted turn-taking behavior based on textual prompts, validated on over 950 hours of dialogue data.

Conclusion: Incorporating textual prompts enables dynamic, context-sensitive control of turn-taking predictions, advancing dialogue systems' adaptability and user interaction.

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on using large language models (LLMs) for Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) by introducing a syntactic retrieval-based prompting strategy for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although advancements in LLMs have benefitted NLP tasks, their applications for ATE, crucial for tasks like translation and information retrieval, remain underexplored.

Method: The paper proposes a domain-agnostic syntactic retrieval-based prompting method in a few-shot setting to select demonstrations based on syntactic similarity rather than semantic similarity.

Result: Experiments across three specialized ATE benchmarks demonstrate improved F1-scores, especially when syntactic cues are emphasized over lexical overlap.

Conclusion: Syntactic cues are integral for adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks, providing reliable term boundary capturing mechanisms.

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agent-RewardBench is introduced as a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling skills for multimodal agents, addressing their limitations in self-correction and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of lack of external feedback in multimodal agents, hindering self-correction and generalization, and the absence of suitable reward model selection for such agents.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark called Agent-RewardBench focusing on real-world agent scenarios. It assesses models across multiple dimensions such as perception, planning, and safety, and evaluates step-level rewards during planning.

Result: Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art multimodal models still perform poorly on Agent-RewardBench, underlining the necessity for specialized training.

Conclusion: Agent-RewardBench highlights gaps in current multimodal model capabilities, offering a tool to foster development in agent reward modeling for real-world tasks.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at

*Andrea McGlinchey,Peter J Barclay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the ability of classifiers to detect fake text generated by large language models (LLMs), focusing on deceiving texts in the style of detective fiction. It observes that one model (Gemini) improved in generating deceptive text, while another (GPT) did not.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With ever-growing LLMs capable of producing convincing fake text, it is crucial to assess whether detection methods can keep up, given advancements in model architectures and resources.

Method: The authors analyze the effectiveness of statistical classifiers in detecting fake text produced by LLMs. They evaluate changes in the deceptive capabilities of models across versions.

Result: Gemini showed improved ability in generating deceptive text with version updates, whereas GPT's ability did not significantly change. Classifiers still exhibited promising detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Reliable detection of fake text may remain achievable despite LLM advancements. However, new architectures like Gemini may present improved text deceptiveness, requiring continued classifier improvement.

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

TL;DR: This paper introduces Double-Checker, a framework to improve reasoning in slow-thinking LLMs through iterative self-critique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limited ability of slow-thinking LLMs to generate critiques and refine solutions.

Method: Double-Checker fine-tunes LLMs using 1,730 self-critical instances to enable iterative self-critique and refinement during inference.

Result: The framework significantly improves reasoning performance, raising pass@1 scores on AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2%.

Conclusion: Iterative self-critique fosters more trustworthy and effective LLMs, opening a promising path for further development.

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

Motivation: LLMs often generate ungrounded or speculative responses when the provided context lacks information, posing challenges for factual consistency and trustworthiness in NLP.

Method: Fine-tuning lightweight encoder models like RoBERTa and NomicBERT on curated datasets for accurate groundedness detection.

Result: These lightweight models achieve accuracy comparable to advanced LLMs such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, while offering significantly faster inference times.

Conclusion: Groundedness detection using lightweight models is both effective and efficient, reducing computation demands and improving LLM reliability.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

### [43] [Detecting Referring Expressions in Visually Grounded Dialogue with Autoregressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21294)
*Bram Willemsen,Gabriel Skantze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores text-only autoregressive models for identifying visually grounded mentions in dialogues using language context alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if linguistic context alone can effectively identify visually grounded referring expressions in dialogues.

Method: Adapt a pretrained large language model for coarse-grained annotation of mention spans using next-token prediction.

Result: Moderately sized LLMs with small datasets and parameter-efficient fine-tuning show promising performance for the task.

Conclusion: Though text-only approaches have potential, the task is inherently multimodal, highlighting limitations of unimodal methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

### [44] [Structuralist Approach to AI Literary Criticism: Leveraging Greimas Semiotic Square for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21360)
*Fangzhou Dong,Yifan Zeng,Yingpeng Sang,Hong Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLASS, a framework enhancing LLMs in performing in-depth literary analysis via Greimas Semiotic Square.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are unable to offer professional literary criticism for complex narratives; enhanced tools are needed.

Method: The authors developed GLASS as a structured analytical framework using the Greimas Semiotic Square and a specialized dataset.

Result: GLASS achieved high performance in literary analysis compared to experts and produced quality analyses of classic works.

Conclusion: The research delivers an AI-based tool advancing literary analysis, educational use, and understanding of literary cognition.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding and generating text but
struggle with providing professional literary criticism for works with profound
thoughts and complex narratives. This paper proposes GLASS (Greimas Literary
Analysis via Semiotic Square), a structured analytical framework based on
Greimas Semiotic Square (GSS), to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct in-depth
literary analysis. GLASS facilitates the rapid dissection of narrative
structures and deep meanings in narrative works. We propose the first dataset
for GSS-based literary criticism, featuring detailed analyses of 48 works. Then
we propose quantitative metrics for GSS-based literary criticism using the
LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework's results, compared with expert
criticism across multiple works and LLMs, show high performance. Finally, we
applied GLASS to 39 classic works, producing original and high-quality analyses
that address existing research gaps. This research provides an AI-based tool
for literary research and education, offering insights into the cognitive
mechanisms underlying literary engagement.

### [45] [Leveraging LLM-Assisted Query Understanding for Live Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21384)
*Guanting Dong,Xiaoxi Li,Yuyao Zhang,Mengjie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omni-RAG is a framework developed to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in handling complex, noisy, and multi-intent queries using advanced LLM-based query preprocessing and retrieval techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges RAG systems face with noisy, ambiguous, and complex user queries in real-world scenarios, where traditional models trained on cleaner data perform poorly.

Method: Omni-RAG uses three modules: (1) query understanding and decomposition to clean and structure input; (2) intent-aware retrieval to fetch relevant information per sub-query; and (3) reranking and generation for refining and producing high-quality outputs.

Result: The Omni-RAG framework improves the performance of RAG systems in handling difficult, real-world queries, making them more robust and effective compared to conventional systems.

Conclusion: Omni-RAG provides a significant step forward for live RAG systems by addressing real-world challenges, serving as a benchmark solution to meet growing demands in open-domain applications.

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

### [46] [Domain Knowledge-Enhanced LLMs for Fraud and Concept Drift Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21443)
*Ali Şenol,Garima Agrawal,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework integrating domain knowledge with large language models to address challenges in detecting deceitful conversations and semantic shifts, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in detecting deceptive conversations and concept drift due to evolving language patterns, combined with limitations of large language models, necessitates improved methodologies.

Method: The proposed framework includes the integration of domain knowledge with LLMs, incorporating modules for fake conversation detection, semantic drift identification, and drift classification as benign or fraudulent.

Result: The system demonstrated a high classification accuracy of 98% and improved performance over zero-shot baselines. It was validated using both fake review datasets and a multiturn dialogue dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating domain knowledge and drift awareness into LLMs enhances accuracy, robustness, and interpretability for detecting fraudulent dialogues and semantic shifts in dynamic NLP applications.

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)\-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk\-sensitive scenarios. To
address these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)\-Enhanced LLM
framework that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task\-specific
insights to perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed
architecture consists of three main components: (1) a DK\-LLM module to detect
fake or deceptive conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine
whether a semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK\-LLM module to
classify the drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value
of domain knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full
framework to SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types
of fraud and spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake
conversations with high accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of
drift. Guided by structured prompts, the LLaMA\-based implementation achieves
98\% classification accuracy. Comparative studies against zero\-shot baselines
demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness
significantly improves performance, interpretability, and robustness in
high\-stakes NLP applications.

### [47] [Text2Cypher Across Languages: Evaluating Foundational Models Beyond English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21445)
*Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy,William Tai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the multilingual capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in translating user questions into Cypher database queries for English, Spanish, and Turkish.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current advancements in LLMs for natural language database querying largely focus on English, leaving non-English languages underexplored. The study aims to address this gap.

Method: The study creates a multilingual test set by translating English Text2Cypher questions into Spanish and Turkish while maintaining Cypher queries. LLMs are evaluated using standardized prompts and metrics.

Result: LLMs perform best in English, followed by Spanish, and then Turkish, attributed to varying amounts of training data and linguistic differences. Translating prompts into Spanish and Turkish shows minimal impact on performance.

Conclusion: Multilingual evaluation for database querying needs more inclusivity. Future efforts should prioritize schema localization and fine-tuning for better support across diverse languages.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

*Anne Wu,Laurent Mazaré,Neil Zeghidour,Alexandre Défossez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for aligning spoken dialogue models using user interaction data, aimed at addressing challenges specific to real-time speech conversations beyond text-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current preference learning methods are tailored to text-based language models and lack the necessary adaptations for handling real-time speech interaction complexities such as interruptions and lack of speaker turn segmentation.

Method: The researchers created a dataset of over 150,000 annotated preference pairs from speech conversations, and fine-tuned a full-duplex speech-to-speech model using offline alignment methods to better handle linguistic and contextual variations.

Result: Experiments confirm that feedback on generic conversations improves the model's ability to produce interactions that are factual, safer, and better aligned contextually. The model's deployment and holistic human evaluations also show significant benefits beyond single-turn speech interactions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of balancing various real-time speech interaction dynamics to build natural, effective spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

### [49] [TopK Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21468)
*Ryosuke Takahashi,Tatsuro Inaba,Kentaro Inui,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modified transformer architecture with a TopK activation function to address limitations of Sparse Autoencoders in interpreting language models. This approach avoids post-hoc training and enhances feature stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse Autoencoders have limitations such as post-hoc training ambiguity and feature instability, hindering their use in understanding and comparing activation spaces in transformer-based language models.

Method: The authors propose modifying the transformer architecture by integrating a TopK activation function directly into chosen layers, making hidden states equivalent to the latent features of a TopK Sparse Autoencoder.

Result: Experiments show that TopK models maintain original LM capabilities while improving interpretability, enabling neuron interventions and detailed analyses of neuron formation across checkpoints and layers.

Conclusion: The TopK modification delivers interpretable, stable, and computationally efficient language models, advancing research in model interpretability and controllability.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).
However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and
internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the
failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due
to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated
by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE
learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of
feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across
different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a
modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK
activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states
equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the
need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.
The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,
computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple
architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while
providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that
the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering
through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of
neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make
TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn
and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future
research on model interpretability and controllability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores reinforcement learning for fine-tuning large language models in various learning modes, finding strong performance improvements in semi/fully online settings compared to offline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to evaluate how reinforcement learning techniques can handle transitions between offline, semi-online, and fully online regimes in fine-tuning large language models for different task types.

Method: The authors conducted experiments involving both verifiable math tasks and non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, comparing two reinforcement learning methods (Direct Preference Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization) across various learning regimes.

Result: The study found that online and semi-online reinforcement learning methods perform similarly and significantly better than offline methods, with multi-tasking further enhancing performance across task types.

Conclusion: Using online or semi-online reinforcement learning and multi-tasking strategies is more effective for large language model fine-tuning than relying solely on offline training methods.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for
finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online
to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our
experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable
instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across
these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

*Jiashuo Wang,Kaitao Song,Chunpu Xu,Changhe Song,Yang Xiao,Dongsheng Li,Lili Qiu,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using a reward system based on future user reactions to enhance user engagement in socially-driven dialogues with interactive LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in prior work where improvements in reasoning over knowledge or planning dialogue acts didn't effectively ensure user engagement in socially-driven dialogues.

Method: The paper develops a user simulator and uses interaction-based Monte Carlo Tree Search (i×MCTS) to collect and optimize conversational experiences, leveraging user reactions as an engagement indicator and applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Result: Experiments on emotional support and persuasion dialogues showed that the proposed approach significantly improved user engagement.

Conclusion: The method aligns interactive LLMs for better social interaction by focusing on user engagement indicators using a novel learning framework.

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

token-level, sentence-pair, and document-level challenges, thereby offering a
thorough assessment of model capabilities. To create this benchmark, we curated
new, original datasets tailored for Slovak and meticulously translated
established English NLU resources. Within this paper, we also present the first
systematic and extensive evaluation of a wide array of Slovak-specific,
multilingual, and English pre-trained language models using the skLEP tasks.
Finally, we also release the complete benchmark data, an open-source toolkit

*Marina Mancoridis,Bec Weeks,Keyon Vafa,Sendhil Mullainathan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether large language models' (LLMs) performance on benchmarks truly reflects understanding or merely gives an illusion of understanding (termed "potemkin understanding"). It introduces methods to measure such illusions and demonstrates that they are widespread.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs' success on benchmark datasets genuinely reflects their conceptual understanding or simply creates an illusion of comprehension.

Method: The authors introduce two techniques: (1) a specially designed benchmark in three domains, and (2) a general procedure to estimate a lower-bound on the existence of potemkin understanding.

Result: The results reveal that "potemkin understanding" is prevalent across a variety of tasks, domains, and LLM models, indicating significant internal conceptual incoherence.

Conclusion: Benchmarks may not accurately reflect LLMs' true conceptual understanding, as they often produce answers that are incompatible with human-like reasoning and reveal deeper inconsistencies in concept representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how users interact with large language models for healthcare queries and identifying risks or challenges in these interactions.

Method: A dataset of 11K real-world conversations was filtered from large-scale conversational AI datasets. A clinician-driven taxonomy was used to study user interactions across 21 different health specialties.

Result: Insights into the nature of healthcare information-seeking behavior were identified, including incomplete user contexts, affective behaviors, and sycophancy induced by leading questions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improving the healthcare support capabilities of conversational AI systems like LLMs, pointing out risks and limitations in their current implementation.

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language
models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of
these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter
large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated
dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use
HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs
when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user
interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals
insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and
interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring
the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs
deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores maximizing language model performance by better organizing training data and introduces a paradigm called DELT with components for scoring, selecting, and ordering data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve language model performance without increasing data scale or model size by focusing on optimizing training data organization.

Method: The paper introduces DELT, a framework with components for Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. Notably, a novel scoring method (LQS) and ordering technique (Folding Ordering) are proposed.

Result: Experiments show DELT improves LM performance without expanding data scale or model size, with the combination of LQS and Folding Ordering yielding the best results.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of data efficacy in LM training, achieving promising results and complementing data efficiency techniques.

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

### [56] [OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20741)
*Qin Ren,Yifan Wang,Ruogu Fang,Haibin Ling,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes OTSurv, a new framework for survival prediction using whole slide images, addressing pathological heterogeneity through optimal transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multiple instance learning (MIL) methods fail to account explicitly for pathological heterogeneity in whole slide images, both globally and locally. This leads to suboptimal survival predictions.

Method: OTSurv models survival prediction as an optimal transport problem with two constraints: global long-tail constraint and local uncertainty-aware constraint. These constraints ensure better modeling of heterogeneity by avoiding mode collapse, reducing noise, and prioritizing high-confidence patches. The problem is formulated as unbalanced OT and solved via a matrix scaling algorithm.

Result: OTSurv achieves state-of-the-art performance across six benchmarks with a 3.6% average improvement in C-index, statistical significance in log-rank tests, and high interpretability.

Conclusion: OTSurv provides a novel, efficient, and highly interpretable approach for survival prediction in digital pathology, addressing key challenges in heterogeneity modeling.

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: StereoDiff introduces a video depth estimator combining stereo matching for static regions and video depth diffusion for dynamic regions, achieving state-of-the-art performance in real-world dynamic video depth benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video depth estimation often rely on fine-tuning pre-trained video diffusion models without addressing the differing temporal consistency needs of static and dynamic regions in videos.

Method: StereoDiff employs a two-stage approach: stereo matching for static areas to leverage global 3D cues and video depth diffusion for dynamic areas to ensure smooth transitions. Frequency domain analysis underpins their complementary strengths.

Result: Experimental findings indicate StereoDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and consistency on zero-shot, real-world indoor and outdoor dynamic video depth benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper highlights StereoDiff's capability in synergizing stereo matching and video depth diffusion, offering superior video depth estimation performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

### [58] [ConViTac: Aligning Visual-Tactile Fusion with Contrastive Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20757)
*Zhiyuan Wu,Yongqiang Zhao,Shan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConViTac, a network for combining vision and touch sensory inputs using a novel Contrastive Embedding Conditioning mechanism that enhances feature alignment and improves accuracy in tasks like material classification and grasping prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods in joint visual-tactile representation learning, which rely on naive direct feature combinations and result in poor integration.

Method: The authors propose a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning (CEC) mechanism for projecting visual and tactile inputs into unified embeddings through a contrastive encoder. These embeddings are fused using cross-modal attention for better alignment.

Result: The proposed approach improves task accuracy by up to 12.0% (e.g., for material classification and grasping prediction), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in real-world tests.

Conclusion: ConViTac and the CEC mechanism effectively enhance visual-tactile feature fusion, showing significant improvements in downstream robotic tasks.

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

*Connor Ludwig,Khashayar Namdar,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares various segmentation models like SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and nnU-Net on medical imaging datasets and finds notable advancements with highly accurate prompts, though nnU-Net continues to dominate due to practical prompt constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of evaluation for promptable segmentation models on standardized medical datasets with various prompt qualities.

Method: The research evaluates SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net via zero-shot inference on the BraTS 2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset, testing point and bounding box prompts, and conducting fine-tuning experiments.

Result: Models like SAM and SAM 2 scored up to 0.894 Dice with precise bounding box prompts, surpassing nnU-Net in these cases. However, nnU-Net was more practical due to the difficulty of generating highly accurate prompts.

Conclusion: While existing promptable models show potential, nnU-Net remains dominant in real-world medical imaging applications. Fine-tuning improves point-prompt performance, but bounding boxes and nnU-Net still outperform it.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

*Stephanie Käs,Anton Burenko,Louis Markert,Onur Alp Culha,Dennis Mack,Timm Linder,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study assesses dynamic full-body gesture recognition models, focusing on human-robot communication in noisy settings. It compares VFM, VLM, and skeletal-based approaches using the new NUGGET dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) in simplifying gesture recognition tasks, replacing task-specific modules in human-robot interaction.

Method: Compared V-JEPA (VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (VLM), and HD-GCN (skeleton-based method) on the NUGGET dataset to assess gesture recognition performance in intralogistics environments.

Result: HD-GCN outperforms others in accuracy; however, V-JEPA shows promising results with a simple classification head. Gemini struggles with gestures based solely on textual input in a zero-shot context.

Conclusion: VJ-EPA can reduce system complexity if adapted for multi-task use, though VLMs like Gemini require further improvements for effective gesture representation.

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

### [61] [Leveraging Vision-Language Models to Select Trustworthy Super-Resolution Samples Generated by Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20832)
*Cansu Korkmaz,Ahmet Murat Tekalp,Zafer Dogan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) to select the most trustworthy super-resolution (SR) images generated by diffusion models, validated through a new Trustworthiness Score (TWS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in selecting trustworthy SR results from diffusion models due to ambiguity and artifacts, especially in information-critical applications.

Method: The paper employs vision-language models (e.g., BLIP-2, GPT-4o) for semantic evaluation of SR samples and introduces the Trustworthiness Score (TWS) to quantify SR reliability based on semantic correctness, structural integrity, and artifact sensitivity.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that TWS strongly correlates with human preferences, and VLM-guided methods deliver consistently high TWS values while outperforming conventional metrics like PSNR and LPIPS in terms of information fidelity and trustworthiness.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable and generalizable approach for super-resolution by aligning outputs with human expectations, setting a benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

### [62] [FixCLR: Negative-Class Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20841)
*Ha Min Son,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FixCLR, a method enhancing semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) by leveraging contrastive learning with domain-invariance explicit regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSDG methods underperform due to label scarcity and lack explicit regularization for domain-invariant representation learning.

Method: FixCLR modifies contrastive learning by using pseudo-labels for class info and a repelling term to enforce domain invariance, complementing other SSDG and semi-supervised methods.

Result: Extensive experiments showed FixCLR improved SSDG effectiveness, especially when combined with other semi-supervised methods, across diverse datasets and domains.

Conclusion: FixCLR is a robust solution for SSDG challenges and enhances performance via explicit regularization and compatibility with existing methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

### [63] [Vector Contrastive Learning For Pixel-Wise Pretraining In Medical Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20850)
*Yuting He,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the COVER framework for improving pixel-wise self-supervised pretraining (SSP) in medical vision by addressing the over-dispersion issue in contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of incorporating pixel-wise representation learning into contrastive learning frameworks, which is critical for medical vision.

Method: The authors propose a new method called COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER), which reformulates contrastive learning as a vector regression problem for pixel-wise feature learning. It employs a vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight tasks, multiple dimensions, and modalities demonstrate significant improvements in pixel-wise SSP using the COVER framework.

Conclusion: The COVER framework advances self-supervised pretraining and enhances generalization for medical visual foundation models by preserving pixel-wise feature correlations.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

*Ryosuke Kawamura,Hideaki Hayashi,Shunsuke Otake,Noriko Takemura,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIDAS, a data augmentation method, to improve Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) on ambiguous facial expressions using soft labels and augmented training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions, which are often encountered in real-world data.

Method: MIDAS combines pairs of video frames and their emotion class labels using soft-label probabilities, extending the "mixup" approach to video data.

Result: Experiments on DFEW and FERV39k-Plus datasets indicate that MIDAS significantly enhances model performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MIDAS method effectively tackles ambiguity in DFER tasks and can improve real-world application performance.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

### [65] [THIRDEYE: Cue-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation via Brain-Inspired Multi-Stage Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20877)
*Calin Teodor Ioan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "ThirdEye," a depth estimation method that explicitly incorporates human visual cues using specialized pre-trained networks and hierarchical processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models for monocular depth estimation rely on implicit learning of cues from RGB pixels, which may ignore explicit monocular cues humans use, such as occlusion boundaries and shading.

Method: The authors propose ThirdEye, a system that integrates explicit monocular cues into the depth estimation process using frozen, pre-trained networks in a three-stage cortical hierarchy with a working-memory module. An adaptive-bins transformer head is used to produce a disparity map.

Result: The paper focuses on extending architectural details, neuroscientific motivations, and protocols for experiments. Quantitative results will be added in subsequent versions.

Conclusion: ThirdEye offers a cue-aware method leveraging pre-trained networks to better emulate human visual depth perception, requiring only minimal fine-tuning of its components.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of generating multi-human images with complex actions while preserving facial identities, exacerbated by the lack of a dedicated benchmark.

Method: The authors created MultiHuman-Testbench, a benchmark containing curated prompts, 5,550 unique human faces, pose conditioning images, and four evaluation metrics. They evaluated various generative models and proposed techniques like human segmentation and Hungarian matching for ID similarity improvements.

Result: The research evaluated zero-shot and training-based generative models, showcasing the challenges in multi-human generation and demonstrating how their techniques improve ID similarity.

Conclusion: MultiHuman-Testbench provides a comprehensive benchmark and new techniques, offering valuable insights and a standardized approach for multi-human image generation research.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

Conclusion: A combination of geometric constraints and learned features improves stereo vision systems in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces.

Abstract: This work investigates the geometric foundations of modern stereo vision

contribute to accurate depth reconstruction. We revisit the Cyclopean Eye model

that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal
abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FaSTA*, a neurosymbolic agent designed for cost-efficient multi-turn image editing by combining fast subtask planning via large language models (LLMs) with localized, precise A* search, while integrating reusable subroutines to enhance efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the inefficiencies and computational expense in multi-turn image editing tasks, aiming to create an agent that combines fast planning with adaptable, cost-effective toolpath optimization.

Method: The method integrates high-level subtask planning by large language models (LLMs) with localized A* search to optimize a cost-efficient sequence of AI tool calls. Additionally, the agent employs inductive reasoning to extract and refine reusable symbolic subroutines over time.

Result: The proposed agent, FaSTA*, achieves significant computational efficiency while maintaining competitive success rates in comparison to state-of-the-art image editing baselines on similar multi-turn tasks.

Conclusion: The FaSTA* framework is an effective and adaptive solution for multi-turn image editing, balancing performance and cost-efficiency through the use of LLM planning, subroutine reuse, and conditional A* search.

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

*Ju-Hyeon Nam,Dong-Hyun Moon,Sang-Chul Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents M2SFormer, a Transformer-based framework to improve forgery localization in images, achieving higher performance than current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate image forgery localization is crucial due to the rise of both creative and malicious image manipulations, but current methods face limitations in computational efficiency and handling complex tampering cases.

Method: M2SFormer uses a Transformer encoder combining multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions in a unified manner, leveraging a global prior map and a difficulty-guided attention module for preserving fine details.

Result: Experiments show M2SFormer achieves superior accuracy and generalization capabilities compared to state-of-the-art forgery localization models on various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: M2SFormer is effective in combining attention mechanisms and contextual cues, offering robust, domain-generalized forgery detection while addressing computational challenges.

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

*Hao Zhang,Haolan Xu,Chun Feng,Varun Jampani,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysRig overcomes limitations of traditional Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) in animation by using a physics-based framework that models objects as deformable soft-body structures, delivering more realistic and plausible results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches like LBS suffer from artifacts causing unrealistic deformations, and fail to properly model elastic materials such as tissues and flexible appendages.

Method: PhysRig uses a physics-based approach embedding rigid skeletons into volumetric tetrahedral meshes simulated as deformable soft-body structures, leveraging continuum mechanics with differentiable materials and skeletal motion.

Result: PhysRig outperformed traditional LBS, yielding realistic and physically plausible outcomes, as evaluated on a dataset with meshes covering diverse object categories and motion patterns.

Conclusion: PhysRig presents a versatile and effective framework for realistic, and physically plausible animation modeling, extending beyond traditional methods by handling complex material properties and skeletal movement.

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing a low-cost alternative to expensive weather sensors for estimating atmospheric visibility in aviation, and addressing the lack of suitable publicly available datasets for supervised learning.

Method: The authors conducted a year-long data collection campaign using FAA weather cameras to create a new dataset. Benchmarks for three standard approaches and comparison with existing public datasets and an ASTM standard were provided.

Result: The presented dataset successfully enhances visibility estimation in aviation. Comparative results against multiple approaches and datasets provide insights into effective methodologies.

Conclusion: This study provides a new, aviation-relevant dataset for machine learning applications and showcases its utility via comparative benchmarks to address atmospheric visibility challenges in aviation.

Abstract: Machine Learning for aviation weather is a growing area of research for

however, in the area of atmospheric visibility estimation, publicly available
datasets, tagged with visibility estimates, of distances relevant for aviation,
of diverse locations, of sufficient size for use in supervised learning, are
absent. This paper introduces a new dataset which represents the culmination of
a year-long data collection campaign of images from the FAA weather camera
network suitable for this purpose. We also present a benchmark when applying
three commonly used approaches and a general-purpose baseline when trained and
tested on three publicly available datasets, in addition to our own, when
compared against a recently ratified ASTM standard.

### [72] [Hierarchical Sub-action Tree for Continuous Sign Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20947)
*Dejie Yang,Zhu Xu,Xinjie Gao,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of limited data and annotations in Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) by introducing a novel Hierarchical Sub-action Tree (HST-CSLR) approach to better align visual and textual modalities using gloss knowledge from large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insufficient training data and precise annotations hinder the progress of CSLR, necessitating a more efficient method to utilize textual gloss knowledge.

Method: The authors propose the Hierarchical Sub-action Tree (HST), which uses a tree structure for textual representation and incorporates gloss-specific knowledge from large language models. A contrastive alignment is further implemented to bridge visual and textual modalities.

Result: Experiments conducted on four datasets—PHOENIX-2014, PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture—demonstrate notable effectiveness of the HST-CSLR approach.

Conclusion: Integrating textual gloss knowledge with visual representation learning through HST-CSLR leads to improved CSLR performance, addressing current gaps in training data and annotations.

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

TL;DR: PathChat+ is a multimodal AI model for pathology that integrates text and image understanding, achieving superior performance and introducing hierarchical diagnostic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current pathology AI models which lack adequate multimodal understanding, rich context usage, and diagnostic reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors developed PathChat+, trained on over 1 million pathology-specific instructions and question-answer datasets, and demonstrated its capabilities through benchmarks. They also introduced SlideSeek, a reasoning-driven diagnostic system.

Result: PathChat+ significantly outperformed earlier versions and other SOTA models, particularly on complex diagnostic benchmarks like DDxBench.

Conclusion: PathChat+ and SlideSeek represent substantial advancements in computational pathology, combining AI models and reasoning systems for accurate, interpretable diagnosis.

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide
images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching
high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis
benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded,
humanly-interpretable summary reports.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFVEdit introduces a zero-shot video editing method for Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) that operates on latent flows without fine-tuning or modifying the attention, achieving faster inference and lower memory use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising computational complexity of existing video editing methods when applied to Video DiTs necessitates a more efficient approach.

Method: DFVEdit utilizes a flow transformation technique and introduces Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV), Implicit Cross Attention (ICA), and Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to refine editing results.

Result: DFVEdit achieves at least 20x inference speed-up, 85% memory usage reduction, and achieves high structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality on models like CogVideoX and Wan2.1.

Conclusion: DFVEdit provides an efficient alternative for video editing on Video DiTs, blending computational efficiency and editing quality seamlessly.

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cradle2Cane, a two-pass face aging framework addressing the Age-ID trade-off by improving age accuracy and identity preservation using text-to-image diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing face aging methods struggling with large age gaps and extreme head poses while balancing age transformation accuracy and identity preservation.

Method: Introduces a two-pass framework using text-to-image diffusion models. The first pass focuses on age accuracy with adaptive noise injection (AdaNI), while the second pass enhances identity preservation using identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb). Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner.

Result: Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ dataset demonstrate that Cradle2Cane achieves superior performance in both age accuracy and identity preservation compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane represents significant progress in face aging by effectively addressing the Age-ID trade-off and achieving realistic transformations across the lifespan.

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

### [77] [3D Scene-Camera Representation with Joint Camera Photometric Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20979)
*Weichen Dai,Kangcheng Ma,Jiaxin Wang,Kecen Pan,Yuhang Ming,Hua Zhang,Wanzeng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for improving 3D scene representation by optimizing camera photometric parameters to separate scene-unrelated information and improve quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of incorporating erroneous scene-unrelated information into 3D scene representations due to inherent photometric distortions in imaging.

Method: Introduce a joint 3D scene-camera representation with a full photometric model and simultaneously optimize camera parameters while incorporating depth regularization.

Result: Achieved high-quality 3D scene representations even under degraded imaging conditions like vignetting and dirt.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective way to enhance 3D scene representation quality by addressing photometric distortions and jointly optimizing both scene radiance and camera photometric parameters.

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new Graph-oriented Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, focusing on addressing uncertainty and multimodality in predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents in autonomous driving is difficult due to its uncertainty and multimodal nature. Current methods primarily rely on supervised learning, which may limit generalizability and fail to address these issues effectively.

Method: The authors introduce the GoIRL framework, combining Inverse Reinforcement Learning with vectorized lane-graph features. They use a feature adaptor for grid-space aggregation, sample reward distributions to generate multiple plans, and refine trajectories with a hierarchical trajectory generator and probability fusion.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse and nuScenes benchmarks, demonstrating better generalization and prediction accuracy compared to traditional supervised models.

Conclusion: GoIRL effectively addresses key challenges of trajectory prediction, offering enhanced accuracy, multimodal predictions, and robust generalization in autonomous driving settings.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits sparse pose signals for text-to-image generation by proposing SP-Ctrl, which enhances sparse signals' spatial alignment and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense signals for pose-guided text-to-image generation face challenges like editing difficulties and inconsistencies with textual prompts, prompting exploration of sparse signals as simpler and more flexible alternatives.

Method: SP-Ctrl extends OpenPose into a learnable spatial representation, adding discriminative keypoint embeddings and keypoint concept learning to improve pose alignment.

Result: SP-Ctrl outperforms spatially controllable T2I methods under sparse-pose guidance and matches dense signal-based methods, showcasing strengths in cross-species image generation.

Conclusion: Sparse signals have untapped potential for pose-guided image generation, and SP-Ctrl achieves better performance and flexibility in guiding diverse generation tasks compared to dense signals.

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D semantic occupancy prediction methods struggle with detecting Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and handling long-tail distributions, creating potential safety hazards in autonomous driving.

Method: The paper proposes a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline for creating enriched datasets (VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360) and introduces OccOoD, a framework enhanced by Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF) for improved OoD detection.

Result: OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art results in OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% in localized regions, while keeping strong overall occupancy prediction capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances 3D semantic occupancy predictions with improved OoD detection, providing a safer and more reliable framework for autonomous driving. Datasets and source code are publicly available for further research.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing
a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing
methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases
the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards.
To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic
Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the
gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that
injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion
patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360.
We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D

leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art
OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% within a 1.2m

TL;DR: The paper presents EVA, a framework that improves compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) through a mixture-of-experts approach and semantic variant alignment, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing CZSL methods, which poorly handle compositional divergence and high-quality primitive representations for accurate fine-grained alignment.

Method: The EVA framework leverages multiple domain experts for token-aware learning and introduces semantic variant alignment to enhance image-primitives matching.

Result: EVA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CZSL methods across three benchmarks in both closed- and open-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed EVA framework improves compositional generalization and fine-grained alignment, offering robust advancements for CZSL tasks.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

TL;DR: The paper addresses panoramic image segmentation challenges by introducing the SFOASS task, solving these with their UNLOCK framework for occlusion-aware and source-free learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic image processing faces challenges of distortion, occlusions, and limited training data, necessitating practical methods that don't rely on labeled source data.

Method: UNLOCK uses Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning to adapt segmentation models without labeled source data, ensuring 360° coverage and occlusion-aware reasoning.

Result: UNLOCK achieves comparable performance to source-dependent methods with state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 mAAP, 11.6 mAP, and improves mAPQ by +4.3, making it effective for panoramic segmentation.

Conclusion: UNLOCK provides a practical, effective solution for source-free panoramic image segmentation, advancing omni-context perception without relying on labeled source information.

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work
advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D vision-language models struggle with point-level tasks such as segmentation due to missing direct 3D-text alignment, limiting their ability to connect local 3D features with textual context.

Method: The proposed TSDASeg model includes a Direct cross-modal Alignment module for explicit 3D-text alignment and a memory module utilizing dedicated memory banks for storing text, visual, and cross-modal features, updated dynamically through self- and cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: TSDASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: By implementing explicit cross-modal alignment and leveraging memory banks for scene-specific feature updates, TSDASeg significantly improves interactive point cloud segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art

*Akio Hayakawa,Masato Ishii,Takashi Shibuya,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a step-by-step method to generate audio from video by producing individual sound event tracks based on text prompts and previously synthesized audio, achieving better audio quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a detailed and comprehensive audio representation of video content, particularly focusing on specific sound events without requiring specialized paired datasets.

Method: Sequential generation of audio tracks for specific sound events in a video using a guided synthesis approach conditioned on text prompts and prior audio tracks, supported by training on accessible data.

Result: The method produces semantically distinct audio tracks for videos, yielding higher-quality composite audio compared to existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves audio synthesis quality by adopting a systematic, guided generation framework and leveraging accessible training data.

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific
sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,
aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more
accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading
to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

*Yeon-Ji Song,Jaein Kim,Byung-Ju Kim,Byoung-Tak Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for generating scenes from unseen perspectives using blurry monocular video inputs, overcoming challenges like dynamic object and camera motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for novel view synthesis struggle with dynamic scenes, blurry input data, and real-world environments, leading to visual fidelity issues.

Method: The paper proposes DBMovi-GS, a model that utilizes sparse-controlled Gaussian splatting to generate dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness and reconstructing detailed scene geometry.

Result: The method demonstrates robust performance in dynamic blurry scenarios and sets a new benchmark for realistic novel view synthesis using monocular video inputs.

Conclusion: DBMovi-GS effectively resolves the challenges of dynamic view synthesis from blurry videos, enhancing visual fidelity and stability in real-world application scenarios.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

TL;DR: ToosiCubix is a method for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles using only monocular images and camera parameters, requiring about 10 user clicks per vehicle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and limited accessibility of existing 3D cuboid annotation methods that depend on specialized camera-LiDAR or stereo setups.

Method: The approach involves user annotating vehicle features with 10 clicks, solving an optimization problem with coordinate descent, and incorporating probabilistic size priors to resolve 9 DoF ambiguities.

Result: Validated effectiveness on KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, achieving scalable, cost-effective, high-quality annotations.

Conclusion: ToosiCubix is a practical, scalable solution for adding accurate 3D annotations to datasets collected using monocular images, without needing specialized equipment.

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

*Qiuyi Qi,Xin Li,Ming Kong,Zikang Xu,Bingdi Chen,Qiang Zhu,S Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Style-Aligned Image Composition (SAIC) method to generate high-quality pathological images, improving neural network training for detecting abnormal cells in cytopathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges like poor annotations, long-tail data distributions, and stained inconsistencies in abnormal cell detection models for cytopathology.

Method: SAIC synthesizes images by selecting proper abnormal cell candidates, reconstructing style-aligned compositions, and using a vision-language model to filter high-quality results.

Result: SAIC-improved detection achieves better performance, robustness for tail categories, and style consistency, aiding clinical applications.

Conclusion: SAIC enhances detection model reliability and generalizability, proving its practical benefit in cytopathological scenarios.

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

*Taoyu Wu,Yiyi Miao,Zhuoxiao Li,Haocheng Zhao,Kang Dang,Jionglong Su,Limin Yu,Haoang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces enhancements to 3D Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM methods for endoscopic scenarios, addressing photometric inconsistencies and motion challenges for better 3D reconstruction and rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM methods struggle in endoscopic environments due to photometric inconsistencies and dynamic motion, causing performance issues in 3D reconstruction and camera pose estimation.

Method: The authors incorporated optical flow loss to act as a geometric constraint, proposed a depth regularization strategy to handle photometric inconsistencies, and refined 3DGS for better rendering by focusing on keyframes with suboptimal quality.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation based on experiments conducted on the C3VD and StereoMIS datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM systems for surgical endoscopic scenarios, offering superior performance in both static and dynamic settings, with plans to release the source code.

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate misuse risks of scene text removal (STR), ensuring ethical applications and detecting STR-processed images.

Method: The study develops ISTR, focusing on binary classification (detect STR usage) and localization (identify removed text regions). It also explores recovering removed text via text recognition.

Result: Experiments confirm high accuracy in detecting STR usage and localizing removed text regions. Recovering removed text was tested to assess its feasibility.

Conclusion: ISTR enables monitoring of STR applications, detecting potential misuse and enhancing STR techniques while posing challenges in text recovery.

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionGuard enhances helmet detection among motorcyclists using adaptive labeling and contextual expansion modules, improving classification and recall in challenging traffic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve helmet regulation enforcement among motorcyclists by overcoming challenges with environmental variability, camera angles, and class imbalance in traffic detection systems.

Method: A multi-stage framework with Adaptive Labeling for refining classifications via tracking and Contextual Expander to address class imbalance by generating virtual bounding boxes.

Result: VisionGuard achieved a 3.1% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) over baseline detectors during experiments.

Conclusion: VisionGuard demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting helmet violations, suggesting potential for real-world traffic surveillance applications for promoting road safety and compliance.

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM4D, a model for segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams using innovative techniques like UMPE and MCMA to enhance alignment, interaction, and temporal consistency. Experiments on Waymo-4DSeg exhibit strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in multi-modal segmentation for dynamically changing autonomous driving scenes and alleviate manual annotation bottlenecks.

Method: The authors propose SAM4D, featuring Unified Multi-modal Positional Encoding (UMPE) for cross-modal feature alignment, and Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA) for enhancing temporal consistency. Additionally, they design a multi-modal automated data engine for fast pseudo-label generation.

Result: Experiments on the Waymo-4DSeg dataset demonstrate SAM4D's robust cross-modal segmentation capabilities and its efficiency in generating accurate pseudo-labels for data annotation.

Conclusion: SAM4D showcases significant potential in improving segmentation in autonomous driving settings while reducing the dependency on expensive manual annotations.

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for
promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal
Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in
a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.
Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),
which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and
long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically
changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop
a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

*Tyler Ward,Xiaoqin Wang,Braxton McFarland,Md Atik Ahamed,Sahar Nozad,Talal Arshad,Hafsa Nebbache,Jin Chen,Abdullah Imran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning framework, FFCL-SAM, to improve tumor margin assessment during breast cancer surgeries using SR images, achieving significant speed and accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of limited accuracy in current 2D specimen radiography-based methods for assessing intraoperative tumor margins, which leads to high rates of additional surgeries in breast cancer patients.

Method: The framework combines the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), including local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification. SR images are annotated and a ResNet-18 backbone is pre-trained with FFCL to classify margin status. Coarse binary masks are later refined through SAM for more accurate segmentation.

Result: The proposed method achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for classifying tumor margins and showed a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline segmentation models, with an inference time of just 47 milliseconds per image.

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM enhances the accuracy and speed of intraoperative margin assessments, reducing potential re-excision rates and improving breast cancer surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model to predict egocentric videos based on past video data and 3D body poses, using a diffusion transformer trained on a large dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how human actions, represented by body poses, shape the environment when viewed from a first-person perspective.

Method: The method involves conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories and training an auto-regressive conditional diffusion transformer using the Nymeria dataset.

Result: The model was tested with a hierarchical evaluation protocol, revealing its abilities in embodied prediction and control within complex real-world environments.

Conclusion: This work is a preliminary exploration into modeling human agent behaviors and real-world environments through egocentric video prediction.

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of
modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with
video prediction from the perspective of a human.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Aging Multiverse framework for generating multiple facial aging trajectories considering factors like environment, health, and lifestyle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of deterministic aging methods and enable diverse, controllable facial aging trajectories.

Method: A training-free diffusion-based method incorporating attention mixing and Simulated Aging Regularization.

Result: Performance surpasses existing models in identity preservation, aging realism, and conditional alignment.

Conclusion: The framework enables multi-dimensional, interpretable facial aging processes, expanding possibilities in storytelling, education, and visualization.

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a visualization method for generating novel views in augmented reality by employing locally reconstructed light fields and highlighting areas requiring additional views to improve synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AR-based novel view synthesis methods rely on mentally demanding and restrictive data collection tasks, which limit user engagement and exploration.

Method: The proposed method leverages locally reconstructed light fields and visualizes error-prone areas to guide users in capturing new views for synthesis, eliminating the need for 3D annotations and fixed sampling areas.

Result: Findings indicate that the error-focused visualization enhances user experience, satisfaction, and allows for fewer view samples while still achieving effective synthesis results.

Conclusion: The approach alleviates user effort in view synthesis tasks, improves satisfaction, and extends applicability to large-scale radiance field reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

### [98] [Bridging Video Quality Scoring and Justification via Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21011)
*Qizhi Xie,Kun Yuan,Yunpeng Qu,Jiachao Gong,Mingda Wu,Ming Sun,Chao Zhou,Jihong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel pipeline (SIG) and dataset (S2I) for adapting video large multimodal models (LMMs) to video quality assessment (VQA) via instruction tuning, enhancing both quality scoring and justification abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video quality assessment methods offer numerical scores that fail to capture complex quality dimensions, limiting their applicability. This paper aims to leverage linguistic output via video LMMs to address this limitation.

Method: The authors propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline, which uses hierarchical Chain-of-Thought reasoning to generate scalable and efficient data without relying on human-written annotations. The pipeline produces the S2I dataset (320K instruction-response pairs) for instruction tuning and introduces a benchmark (S2I-Bench) for evaluating video LMMs.

Result: Experimental evaluations showed consistent improvements in quality scoring and justification across multiple video LMMs using the proposed SIG pipeline and S2I dataset.

Conclusion: The SIG pipeline and S2I dataset significantly enhance video LMMs' ability to assess video quality through instruction tuning, while offering scalable and effective alternatives to traditional methods. The S2I-Bench also demonstrates the justification capacity of these models.

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

*Huan Wang,Haoran Li,Huaming Chen,Jun Yan,Jiahua Shi,Jun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC) is proposed to address data heterogeneity challenges in FL using semantic-level prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the data heterogeneity challenge in federated learning caused by biased labeling preferences and explore semantic information within clients.

Method: FedSC constructs semantic-level relational prototypes and consistent prototypes. It employs inter-contrastive learning to align embeddings with semantic relational prototypes and discrepancy aggregation to constrain local model optimization.

Result: FedSC effectively captures class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous clients and demonstrates superior performance in experiments under challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: FedSC offers a promising approach to mitigate data heterogeneity in federated learning, with theoretical convergence guarantees and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of skin disease datasets such as class imbalance, privacy concerns, and object bias, and to improve data augmentation efficiency for machine learning diagnosis tools.

Method: The work developed a classical-quantum GAN with a novel latent space fusion technique to enable the generation of high-quality color medical images. The model was tested for performance on both classical and real quantum hardware.

Result: The proposed model surpassed classical GANs and existing hybrid quantum models in image quality and classifier performance, requiring significantly fewer parameters and training epochs. It also demonstrated robustness on IBM's quantum machines.

Conclusion: Quantum image generation, especially with hybrid models, holds significant promise for medical data augmentation as quantum hardware continues to improve, with high potential for efficiency and practical applicability.

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

TL;DR: The study proposes MPA-FER, a framework enhancing facial expression recognition by aligning and blending multimodal visual-textual data, leveraging advanced techniques like ChatGPT for detailed descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial expression recognition methods struggle to capture detailed textual-visual relationships crucial for fine distinctions in expressions.

Method: MPA-FER includes LLM-driven hard prompt generation, prototype-guided visual alignment, and a cross-modal alignment module to sync textual and visual data.

Result: The framework surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks, ensuring accurate recognition while utilizing pretrained models and saving computational costs.

Conclusion: Using multimodal alignment and external knowledge enhances precision and efficiency in facial expression recognition, showing significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces LASFNet, a lightweight multimodal object detection framework that simplifies feature-level fusion and enhances efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous multimodal object detection methods are computationally expensive due to complex feature-level fusion designs.

Method: The paper proposes LASFNet with an attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion module (ASFF) and a feature attention transformation module (FATM).

Result: Experiments on three datasets show LASFNet reduces parameters and computational costs by up to 90% and 85%, respectively, while increasing detection accuracy by 1%-3%.

Conclusion: LASFNet provides an efficient and accurate approach for multimodal object detection by using a single lightweight feature-level fusion unit and minimizing information loss.

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to represent images as sequences of binary vectors, achieving competitive performance in image generation using a highly compact 1D binary latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advancements in 1D latent spaces aim to reduce the number of image tokens and eliminate the need for 2D structures, but further efficiency and resolution preservation are needed.

Method: The method represents images in a 1D binary latent space instead of traditional one-hot token encoding, allowing for just 128 discrete tokens for high-resolution images up to 1024x1024.

Result: The approach demonstrates up to a 32-fold token reduction compared to standard methods, with competitive generation performance and significant improvements in training and inference speed.

Conclusion: This work delivers an efficient, scalable image-tokenization approach that maintains resolution while reducing computational costs, without relying on private data or additional refinements.

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DidSee, a diffusion-based method for depth completion of non-Lambertian objects, overcoming traditional challenges and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional depth completion struggles with generalization due to noisy data and limited training diversity, especially for non-Lambertian objects.

Method: DidSee employs a rescaled noise scheduler to reduce signal leakage bias, a noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to mitigate exposure bias, and a semantic enhancer to enable joint depth completion and semantic segmentation.

Result: DidSee achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across benchmarks, improves generalization in real-world settings, and enhances downstream tasks like robotic grasping and pose estimation.

Conclusion: DidSee effectively addresses biases and challenges in depth completion for non-Lambertian objects, providing precise, generalizable results with implications for broader applications.

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation
and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/

*Boyong He,Yuxiang Ji,Zhuoyue Tan,Liaoni Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors address the challenge of domain gaps affecting detector performance by using diffusion models for domain generalization and adaptation. They optimize feature extraction to enhance performance and reduce inference time while leveraging an object-centered auxiliary branch for robust, domain-invariant detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain gaps between training and testing data cause a performance drop in detectors, and existing methods utilizing diffusion models struggle with high inference costs and underutilize their potential.

Method: The authors introduce intermediate feature extraction from a single-step diffusion process to speed up performance and integrate an object-centered auxiliary branch with box-masked images and class prompts. They also employ consistency loss to align auxiliary and primary branches, and utilize feature-level and object-level alignments for domain adaptation and generalization.

Result: The proposed method achieves competitive results across 3 domain adaptation benchmarks, 5 domain generalization benchmarks, and demonstrates superior performance in large domain shifts and low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: This work highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of diffusion models for cross-domain detection tasks, outperforming in both domain generalization and adaptation, while offering insights into visual perception tasks across diverse domains.

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), a technique for improving image editing by balancing between editability and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between editability (extent of modification) and faithfulness (preservation of unaltered elements) in image editing using text-guided diffusion models.

Method: The paper proposes Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which integrates guidance to enhance preservation and a scheduling strategy to align editability and faithfulness.

Result: FGS demonstrates superior preservation of original image information while maintaining editability. It also proves compatible with various editing methods.

Conclusion: FGS offers a scalable and effective solution for precise, high-quality image edits across a diverse range of tasks by balancing editability and faithfulness.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

*Shangbo Wu,Yu-an Tan,Ruinan Ma,Wencong Ma,Dehua Zhu,Yuanzhang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores how self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) features can improve adversarial attack transferability, introducing dSVA, a dual self-supervised ViT features attack method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the black-box transferability of adversarial perturbations by leveraging self-supervised ViT representations instead of traditional supervised learning features.

Method: The authors developed dSVA, a generative attack framework that uses contrastive learning (CL) and masked image modeling (MIM) global and local features in self-supervised ViTs alongside a generator that exploits the attention mechanism for black-box adversarial example creation.

Result: The study found that self-supervised ViTs' dual features (CL and MIM) offer distinct properties that, when combined, significantly improve adversarial generalizability, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging both global and local deep features from self-supervised ViTs proves effective for crafting adversarial examples with enhanced cross-model transferability, marking progress in adversarial attack techniques.

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new task called "Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching" tailored for flexible, multi-granularity document analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document analysis solutions are insufficient for customized and flexible applications due to predefined category limitations.

Method: The paper designed a benchmark named RoI-Matching-Bench with three difficulty levels and proposed a framework RoI-Matcher, using a siamese network and cross-attention layers for feature extraction and semantic alignment.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the method's effectiveness using RoI-Matching-Bench as the benchmark, showcasing its high performance.

Conclusion: The RoI-Matcher serves as a baseline and promising approach for class-agnostic region matching, enabling better customization in document analysis solutions.

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAMURAI, a framework that combines semantic matching and shape-guided methods to retrieve 3D objects from masked 2D images and language descriptions, addressing challenges in complex indoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in open-world 3D object retrieval arise due to limited access to 3D scene context, distorted viewpoints, ambiguous language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks.

Method: SAMURAI integrates semantic matching via CLIP, shape-guided re-ranking using binary silhouettes, and a preprocessing pipeline to improve mask quality by removing background noise.

Result: The proposed approach achieves competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set, demonstrating its usefulness in fusing shape priors with language understanding.

Conclusion: Combining shape-based and language-based cues enhances the robustness and effectiveness of 3D object retrieval in complex scenes.

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseMaster is an end-to-end 3D character generation framework that unifies pose transformation and 3D character creation while addressing issues like image distortion during pose standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for 3D character modeling face challenges like distortions caused by self-occlusion in the pose standardization stage, ultimately degrading 3D geometry quality.

Method: PoseMaster uses a flow-based 3D native generation framework. It incorporates 3D body bones as pose conditions and enhances generalizability through random condition-dropping during training. A pose-control dataset is used to train the model on skeleton-skinning relationships.

Result: PoseMaster outperforms existing techniques in generating A-pose characters, with stronger performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. It also achieves precise pose control for arbitrary poses.

Conclusion: By unifying pose transformation and 3D character generation, PoseMaster addresses challenges in current methods and delivers superior performance and control in 3D character modeling.

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in multimodal reasoning within Large Language Models (LLMs). It proposes improvements using reinforcement learning and introduces a new benchmark for evaluating complex human intention understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models struggle with insufficient global context understanding and shortcut issues, leading to misinterpreted multimodal contexts and overlooked key clues.

Method: The paper uses reinforcement learning guided by context, format, accuracy, and logical rewards judged by LLMs. It also introduces an omni-modal reasoning benchmark called IntentBench.

Result: The method demonstrates improved reasoning performance on various omni-modal benchmarks compared to other open-source models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances multimodal reasoning capabilities, addressing existing challenges and providing a foundation for better understanding of complex human intentions in multimodal data.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

Conclusion: EgoAdapt is a viable solution for efficient and effective egocentric perception, reiterating its practicality in real-world applications.

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory
egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with
substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for
real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this
paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal
distillation and policy learning to enable efficient inference across different
egocentric perception tasks, including egocentric action recognition, active
speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is
adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable.
Experimental results on three challenging egocentric datasets EPIC-Kitchens,
EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly
enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%,
and energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the

TL;DR: The paper introduces Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM), a stereo matching model that combines small-scale cost volumes with efficient feature integration for real-time, highly accurate disparity estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and real-time stereo matching is crucial for autonomous systems, but achieving both high precision and speed is challenging due to computational demands of large-scale cost volumes and limited information in small-scale cost volumes.

Method: ESM integrates initial disparity estimation with image features using shuffling and layer splitting, followed by refinement via a compact hourglass network to improve accuracy and computational efficiency.

Result: The compact version of ESMStereo achieves real-time performance, producing accurate disparity maps at speeds of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on AGX Orin.

Conclusion: ESM offers a viable solution for balancing accuracy and computational speed in stereo matching, making it suitable for modern autonomous systems requiring real-time scene geometry reconstruction.

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OracleFusion, a semantic typography framework utilizing Multimodal Large Language Models and structural vector fusion to enhance the decipherment of undeciphered Oracle Bone Script (OBS) characters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are 4,500 OBS characters discovered, but only 1,600 are deciphered, leaving researchers facing difficulties due to the complex structure and abstract nature of the undeciphered characters.

Method: The framework involves a two-stage approach: (1) leveraging a Multimodal Large Language Model with Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze and localize key components of OBS glyphs, and (2) using Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF) to generate semantic and visually enriched vector fonts while preserving glyph structure constraints.

Result: OracleFusion demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in terms of semantic accuracy, visual appeal, and glyph structural maintenance through extensive qualitative and quantitative tests.

Conclusion: OracleFusion significantly aids the characterization and deciphering of previously uninterpreted OBS characters, providing high-quality visual and semantic insights and acting as a critical tool for experts in this domain.

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the

incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides

*Luosheng Xu,Dalin Zhang,Zhaohui Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlickCD is a lightweight model for remote sensing change detection that balances computational efficiency with high accuracy, introducing novel modules for effective feature extraction and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and high resource demands of modern deep learning models for change detection in remote sensing, specifically for applications requiring on-satellite processing.

Method: FlickCD proposes the Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) for feature optimization and a decoder with Local-Global Fusion Blocks using two advanced attention mechanisms: Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global Self-Attention (EGSA).

Result: FlickCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while reducing computational and storage requirements by over an order of magnitude, with less than 1% reduction in F1-score.

Conclusion: FlickCD balances the trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for applications with limited resource availability, such as on-satellite processing.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

*Yujia Liang,Jile Jiao,Zhicheng Wang,Xuetao Feng,Zixuan Ye,Yuan Wang,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) struggle with multi-shot scenarios. A new dataset, MultiClip-Bench, and a new model, IPFormer-VideoLLM, are introduced to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoLLMs cannot effectively handle multi-shot videos due to the lack of multi-shot annotations in existing datasets, leading to challenges like instance identity forgetting and key frame negligence.

Method: The study introduces MultiClip-Bench, a dataset with dense descriptions and instruction-based Q&A pairs for multi-shot scenarios. It also proposes IPFormer-VideoLLM, a model that injects instance-level features as prompts using attention-based connectors to better aggregate instance-specific information.

Result: The MultiClip-Bench dataset significantly improves multi-shot scenario performance in evaluations, and the IPFormer-VideoLLM model demonstrates superior understanding of multi-scene videos compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work establishes the importance of tailored datasets and feature-enhancing models for addressing multi-shot challenges in video understanding, providing a foundation for future advancements in VideoLLMs.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents CL-Splats, a method to efficiently update 3D scene representations using Gaussian splatting, focusing on scene changes without requiring full recomputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient, high-quality updates to dynamic 3D scene representations in scenarios like robotics and mixed reality.

Method: A robust change-detection module to identify updated/static parts of a scene, and incremental local optimization for time-saving updates.

Result: CL-Splats delivers higher reconstruction quality and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CL-Splats provides a scalable solution for real-time 3D scene updates, laying groundwork for advancements in scene reconstruction technologies.

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

*Hai Jiang,Binhao Guan,Zhen Liu,Xiaohong Liu,Jian Yu,Zheng Liu,Songchen Han,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing extremely low-light RAW images (as low as 0.0001 lux) by providing a new dataset and a novel enhancement framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in low-light RAW image enhancement for cases where environmental illuminance drops to extremely low levels (e.g., 0.0001 lux), largely because existing datasets and methods are insufficient for such challenging conditions.

Method: The authors created a paired data synthesis pipeline to generate a dataset called SIED with extremely low-light RAW images across precise illuminance ranges and corresponding high-quality sRGB references. They also developed a diffusion-based enhancement framework with an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss to improve exposure correction and color restoration.

Result: Extensive experiments on the SIED dataset and other public benchmarks show that the proposed approach delivers effective enhancement, producing visually pleasing and accurate results even under extremely low-light conditions.

Conclusion: The combination of the proposed dataset and framework significantly advances the capabilities of low-light RAW image enhancement, particularly in extreme darkness, and facilitates further research in this domain.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image
enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the
environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available

### [120] [HalluSegBench: Counterfactual Visual Reasoning for Segmentation Hallucination Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21546)
*Xinzhuo Li,Adheesh Juvekar,Xingyou Liu,Muntasir Wahed,Kiet A. Nguyen,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HalluSegBench, a benchmark to evaluate hallucinations in vision-language segmentation using counterfactual visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language segmentation models often hallucinate, producing incorrect masks or labels, and existing evaluation methods fail to address such hallucinations effectively, particularly in terms of visual context.

Method: The authors develop HalluSegBench, comprising a dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs covering 281 object classes, along with new metrics to assess hallucination sensitivity in visually edited scenes.

Result: Experiments reveal that vision-driven hallucinations are more frequent than label-driven ones, with models consistently generating false segmentations.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the importance of counterfactual reasoning for improving the grounding and evaluation of vision-language segmentation models to address hallucinations.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

*Jiawei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces YOLO-FDA, an advanced YOLO-based framework for industrial surface defect detection, addressing issues like multiscale robustness and fine-grained requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-based methods struggle with redundant features, detail sensitivity, and multiscale robustness in defect detection tasks due to variability in defect characteristics and material textures.

Method: YOLO-FDA combines a BiFPN-style architecture for feature aggregation, a Detail-directional Fusion Module for spatial semantic consistency, and innovative attention-based strategies for contextual enhancement.

Result: YOLO-FDA demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art defect detection methods.

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA offers a promising solution for complex industrial surface defect detection, enhancing multiscale performance and sensitivity to fine details.

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

*Junwen Wang,Oscar Maccormac,William Rochford,Aaron Kujawa,Jonathan Shapey,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces tree-based semantic loss functions to enhance hyperspectral imaging (HSI) segmentation by leveraging the label hierarchy, achieving state-of-the-art results on a clinically-relevant dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite hyperspectral imaging's potential in surgery for distinguishing subtle biological tissue differences, existing biomedical segmentation methods fail to leverage label semantics, treating all errors equally.

Method: Introduced two tree-based semantic loss functions that utilize label hierarchies and incorporated them into a recently proposed approach for sparse, background-free annotations.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance on a 107-class HSI dataset with a clinically-defined semantic tree, while also enabling effective detection of out-of-distribution pixels.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic loss functions significantly improve HSI segmentation by exploiting inter-class relationships in the label hierarchy and addressing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution challenges.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in myocardial scar segmentation from cardiac MRI, particularly issues like label noise, data heterogeneity, and class imbalance, to improve clinical assessment and treatment planning.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning state-of-the-art models, using Kullback-Leibler loss and applying extensive data augmentation to handle label noise and other challenges.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms models like nnU-Net, producing accurate and smooth segmentations despite noisy labels, and demonstrates generalizability on out-of-distribution datasets.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a robust automated myocardial scar quantification methodology that supports broader clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential
for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a
robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and
segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly
addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data
heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and
extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute
and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth
segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader
clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

*Pufan Li,Bi'an Du,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images, improving multiview consistency and geometric detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating 3D objects often lack multiview consistency and geometric detail when reconstructing from single-view images. There's a need for a solution that integrates geometry and perception priors seamlessly.

Method: The proposed method trains three Gaussian branches initialized from geometry prior, perception prior, and Gaussian noise. These branches interact mutually, leveraging 2D pretrained diffusion models, and are refined with a reprojection-based strategy to enforce depth consistency.

Result: Experiments show that the method yields higher-fidelity 3D reconstructions and better novel view synthesis compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The method successfully integrates geometry and perception priors to generate robust and consistent 3D objects from single images, surpassing current approaches in quality of reconstruction and synthesis.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

*Longkun Zou,Kangjun Liu,Ke Chen,Kailing Guo,Kui Jia,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method, Topology-Aware Modeling (TAM), to address domain gaps in point cloud semantic learning for 3D object shapes caused by simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate the Sim2Real domain gap in learning from 3D object shape point sets, which arises due to geometric differences between synthetic training data and real-world testing data, limiting model generalization.

Method: The method introduces a Topology-Aware Modeling (TAM) framework that leverages global spatial topology and models topological relations of local geometric features using a self-supervised task. It also proposes a self-training strategy that combines cross-domain contrastive learning with noise-tolerant pseudo-label processing.

Result: Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks demonstrate that the TAM framework outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across all tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed TAM framework effectively bridges the Sim2Real domain gap by incorporating global topology and a robust self-training process, leading to improved adaptability of point classifiers.

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

*Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Peitian Zhang,Kun Lun,Huaying Yuan,Juenjie Zhou,Shitao Xiao,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-X^2L improves long-video understanding by effectively compressing key-value pairs (KV) to preserve task-relevant information while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-video understanding is challenging due to the high computational cost, leading to information loss in existing compression methods.

Method: Video-X^2L uses bi-level KV compression to generate low-compression and high-compression KVs, and selective KV re-loading to preserve critical information during decoding.

Result: Video-X^2L significantly outperforms other KV-compression approaches across popular benchmarks, with reduced computational requirements.

Conclusion: This method provides a flexible, efficient solution for LVU tasks while being compatible with existing multimodal large language models without additional training.

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

*Zijun Lin,Shuting He,Cheston Tan,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GroundFlow, a module designed to enhance sequential grounding in 3D point clouds by improving temporal reasoning over multiple-step text instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D visual grounding methods struggle with sequential tasks due to their inability to process temporal context effectively, especially pronouns and step-dependent instructions.

Method: GroundFlow integrates temporal reasoning by selectively leveraging both short-term and long-term information relevant to each step in the sequence. It is a plug-in module for 3DVG tasks.

Result: Integrating GroundFlow improved task accuracy by significant margins (+7.5% and +10.2%), outperforming even large pre-trained 3D language models in a benchmark across five datasets.

Conclusion: GroundFlow enhances existing 3DVG models with temporal reasoning capabilities, setting a new performance standard for the SG3D benchmark.

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedPrompt integrates a language model (LLM) with modular CNNs to enable scalable, flexible, and prompt-driven medical imaging workflows across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical imaging systems are task-specific and lack flexibility. MedPrompt aims to create a scalable, dynamic framework that accommodates diverse tasks without extensive retraining.

Method: MedPrompt combines few-shot prompted Large Language Models (Llama-4-17B) for workflow planning with a modular Convolutional Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for image processing. Task-specific neural weights are dynamically routed without retraining the entire system.

Result: MedPrompt achieved 97% correctness in executing prompt-driven instructions, 2.5-second inference latency for near real-time usage, and competitive accuracy metrics in segmentation (Dice 0.9856 for lungs) and classification (F1 0.9744 for tuberculosis) across 19 public datasets.

Conclusion: MedPrompt successfully addresses scalability, task diversity, and workflow flexibility in medical image analysis, making it suitable for near real-time medical applications.

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the

### [129] [BitMark for Infinity: Watermarking Bitwise Autoregressive Image Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21209)
*Louis Kerner,Michel Meintz,Bihe Zhao,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BitMark introduces a robust, bitwise watermarking framework for text-to-image models like Infinity, designed to identify and mitigate the reuse of generated content in training data. It maintains high visual fidelity, robustness against removal, and radioactivity properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preventing model collapse due to repeated use of generated images as training data for image generative models.

Method: BitMark embeds watermarks directly into the bit-level token stream of generated images across multiple resolutions during the image generation process, ensuring robustness, visual fidelity, and radioactivity.

Result: The proposed watermarking method is robust against removal techniques and ensures radioactive traces are detectable, even in models fine-tuned on watermarked data.

Conclusion: BitMark provides a reliable and principle-based solution to detect generated images and address challenges of model collapse in image generative models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

*Xiwei Xuan,Ziquan Deng,Kwan-Liu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on solving the challenge of training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation using high-quality reference data to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OVS methods often rely on pre-trained models or synthetic data, which are limited by model capabilities and reference quality.

Method: The authors propose a framework emphasizing data quality, involving a data pipeline for creating segment-text embeddings and similarity-based retrieval.

Result: The new approach demonstrates superior performance over existing methods on ten benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: High-quality data plays a pivotal role in advancing training-free OVS, as showcased by the framework's success.

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

*Umaima Rahman,Mohammad Yaqub,Dwarikanath Mahapatra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiMPLe, which disentangles invariant and spurious features across vision and language modalities to enhance generalization and robustness in multi-modal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spurious correlations in visual data harm out-of-distribution (OOD) performance, especially in multi-modal settings involving vision and language. The authors aim to improve generalization and robustness by addressing these correlations.

Method: DiMPLe employs disentanglement of features within and across modalities, using mutual information minimization, spurious feature regularization, and contrastive learning on invariant features.

Result: DiMPLe outperforms CoOp-OOD in extensive experiments, averaging superior results across 11 datasets and achieving significant gains in both base and novel class accuracy: 15.27 and 44.31, respectively.

Conclusion: Disentangling invariant and spurious features across vision and language modalities via DiMPLe demonstrates improved OOD generalization, novel class accuracy, and robustness to distribution shifts.

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in
base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

*Xianghan Meng,Zhengyu Tong,Zhiyuan Huang,Chun-Guang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for Human Motion Segmentation (HMS) called Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering (TR²C), achieving state-of-the-art results by creating temporally consistent structured representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing subspace clustering-based methods for HMS, which fail in scenarios with complex human motions and cluttered backgrounds.

Method: A novel HMS approach called Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering (TR²C) that jointly learns structured representations and affinity, ensuring alignment with Union-of-Subspaces structures.

Result: State-of-the-art performances were demonstrated through extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets.

Conclusion: TR²C effectively segments human motion by learning temporally consistent structured representations that align with UoS structures, overcoming the drawbacks of existing methods.

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

### [133] [DuET: Dual Incremental Object Detection via Exemplar-Free Task Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21260)
*Munish Monga,Vishal Chudasama,Pankaj Wasnik,Biplab Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of existing methods for object detection in real-world scenarios by proposing Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD) and introducing a novel model merging framework called DuET with enhanced evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for incremental object detection struggle separately with either adapting to domain shifts (DIOD) or learning new object categories (CIOD), creating significant challenges for effectively addressing real-world applications.

Method: The paper introduces DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework with Directional Consistency Loss to mitigate sign conflicts. It also proposes the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI) to evaluate retention (catastrophic forgetting) and adaptability (domain generalization).

Result: Experiments on datasets like the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series show substantial improvements in RAI (+13.12% and +11.39%, respectively) while maintaining high retention indices (89.3% and 88.57%).

Conclusion: DuET successfully demonstrates a practical, detector-agnostic approach for Dual Incremental Object Detection, making it suitable for real-time applications with increased adaptability and retention capabilities.

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

*Cheng Zou,Senlin Cheng,Bolei Xu,Dandan Zheng,Xiaobo Li,Jingdong Chen,Ming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter) reformulates video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task using Diffusion Transformer, significantly improving spatial-temporal consistency and garment detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in video virtual try-on such as spatial-temporal inconsistency and poor garment detail preservation in existing methods.

Method: Introduces a video inpainting framework leveraging Diffusion Transformer with 3D spatial-temporal attention, masking strategies, and multi-stage training for garment inpainting.

Result: Experimental results indicate ViTI achieves superior spatial-temporal consistency and garment detail fidelity compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ViTI model demonstrates advancements in video virtual try-on tasks, outperforming existing approaches while maintaining garment detail and spatial-temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, dataset, and method to achieve precise word-level typography control in generated images, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise typography control at the word level in generated images remains challenging and unaddressed effectively.

Method: A new dataset, TIA framework leveraging cross-modal text-image alignment, the WordCon PEFT method, masked latent loss, and joint-attention loss techniques are introduced.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative results show the new method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in word-level image typography.

Conclusion: The paper provides a scalable solution for fine-grained scene text rendering with improved controllability; resources will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraSurg innovates surgical video synthesis using a dual-model framework integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance, achieving superior results in creating high-quality, context-aware surgical videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of consistency and factual simulation in existing surgical video generation methods, aiming to incorporate fine-grained guidance and domain-specific understanding.

Method: HieraSurg employs two specialized diffusion models: one for predicting semantic changes from a given surgical phase and initial frame, and another for generating videos based on augmented temporal segmentation maps with visual features.

Result: The framework demonstrated superior performance in both quantitative and qualitative analyses, showcasing strong generalization, detailed texture rendering, higher frame-rate video generation, and effective surgical information integration.

Conclusion: HieraSurg represents a significant advancement in surgical video synthesis, offering improved consistency with surgical phases and actions, enhanced generation quality, and potential for practical applications in surgical training and simulation.

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

*Lars Möllenbrok,Behnood Rasti,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoSMAE, a continual self-supervised learning framework based on masked autoencoders, to address catastrophic forgetting in remote sensing without requiring extensive labeled datasets. CoSMAE improves generalization and achieves significant gains in performance with two main techniques: data mixup and model mixup knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning methods in remote sensing face challenges associated with catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of obtaining labeled data, necessitating more efficient, self-supervised approaches.

Method: CoSMAE uses two complementary techniques: data mixup, which blends images across sequential tasks for retaining previous data structures, and model mixup knowledge distillation, which blends weights from past and current models to form a teacher model.

Result: CoSMAE delivers substantial improvements up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art continual learning methods applied to masked autoencoders.

Conclusion: The proposed CoSMAE framework effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting, improves generalization across tasks, and offers an accessible solution for continual learning in remote sensing by leveraging self-supervised methods rather than costly labeled datasets.

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and
reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that
CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art
CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at:

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, particularly at line-level granularity, validated by extensive experiments and comparisons to vision-language models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective in precise visual grounding, paving the way for advanced document understanding systems; resources have been made publicly available.

Abstract: Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored
challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA)
systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework
designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual
documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language
models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer
spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from
the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations
across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level
granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation
studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning.
Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the
limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the
effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave
the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in
real-world, text-centric scenarios. Code and dataset has been made available at

TL;DR: The study explores learning disentangled representations from synthetic data and applying them to real images, presenting a novel metric for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangled representation learning has struggled with real images due to challenges like generative factor correlations, resolution, and lack of ground truth labels.

Method: They leverage synthetic data to learn disentangled representations for real data and evaluate their quality using a proposed interpretable intervention-based metric.

Result: Their empirical study shows that disentanglement can transfer to real data from synthetic data effectively to some degree.

Conclusion: Transferring disentangled representations from synthetic to real data is feasible and beneficial, with a new metric helping to assess encoding quality.

Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the
fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in
representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not
fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative
factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels.
Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging
synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable
to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of
disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive
empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new
interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors
encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of
disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is
possible and effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with complex tasks involving human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized vision-language datasets tailored to such tasks.

Method: The authors created a specialized dataset by integrating human keypoints with features like bounding boxes and captions, producing 200,328 samples for fine-tuning VLMs in human-centric tasks. They also established an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding Benchmark (E-HPAUB) and fine-tuned the LLaVA-1.5-7B model.

Result: The fine-tuned LLaVA-Pose model achieved a 33.2% performance improvement on the E-HPAUB benchmark compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B.

Conclusion: Integrating keypoints into datasets significantly enhances VLMs' ability to understand human-centric scenes, offering a promising direction for improving multimodal models in this domain.

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual
understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex
visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized
vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant
improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2%
compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical state space model for surgical workflow analysis, enabling efficient processing of long robot-assisted surgery videos and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of analyzing long-duration videos in robotic surgeries, where transformers' quadratic attention mechanisms are computationally limiting.

Method: The method involves a hierarchical state space model with a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, employing local and global dynamics, and trained using hybrid discrete-continuous supervision.

Result: The model outperformed state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple datasets: +2.8% (Cholec80), +4.3% (MICCAI2016), and +12.9% (Heichole).

Conclusion: The proposed state space model enables scalable and effective surgical workflow analysis, demonstrating superior performance in processing long surgical videos and capturing dynamics at multiple levels.

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available

TL;DR: This paper introduces PanSt3R, a unified model for 3D geometry and multi-view panoptic segmentation that eliminates test-time optimization and offers state-of-the-art performance with improved speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate 3D scene panoptic segmentation without depending on computationally intensive test-time optimization from 2D panoptic segmentations.

Method: PanSt3R jointly predicts 3D geometry and multi-view panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass, building on MUSt3R and enhancing scalability, semantic awareness, and multi-view segmentation capabilities.

Result: PanSt3R delivers state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks and is significantly faster than existing methods due to its elimination of test-time optimization.

Conclusion: PanSt3R represents a simpler, faster, and more effective approach to 3D panoptic segmentation, providing speed and accuracy advantages over previous methods.

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

*Yizhe Cheng,Chunxun Tian,Haoru Wang,Wentao Zhu,Xiaoxuan Ma,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-informed machine learning framework for solving electromagnetic inverse scattering problems, which enhances generalization and robustness, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional electromagnetic inverse scattering solutions are ill-posed and nonlinear, making them unsuitable for scenarios such as sparse transmitter setups and unseen data. Previous machine learning approaches showed promise but lacked generalization and robustness.

Method: The authors propose a physics-driven two-stage framework that includes a current estimator for learning induced currents and a permittivity solver to determine relative permittivity. This allows end-to-end, data-driven training and inference with improved generalization and robustness.

Result: The proposed method shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy, generalization to unseen data, and robustness against sparse transmitter setups.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel and generalizable approach to electromagnetic inverse scattering based on physics-driven insights, paving the way for practical and cost-effective solutions in electromagnetic imaging applications.

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ShotBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI understanding of cinematic language, and ShotQA, a large-scale dataset. It fine-tuned ShotVL, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding cinematic grammar and improving AI models for nuanced video comprehension and generation.

Method: Creation of ShotBench (benchmark with annotated QA pairs) and ShotQA (large-scale dataset), followed by developing ShotVL through fine-tuning and optimization techniques.

Result: ShotVL outperformed other models on ShotBench, achieving state-of-the-art performance and exposing deficiencies in existing VLMs.

Conclusion: The study addresses gaps in cinematic language understanding among VLMs with new benchmarks and models, advancing AI capabilities in film visual grammar comprehension.

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We
open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial
area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoPa-SG, a synthetic and precise scene graph dataset with exhaustive annotations, along with novel concepts of parametric and proto-relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of accurate scene graph data, which limits the effectiveness of current methods for 2D scene understanding.

Method: The authors developed CoPa-SG, a synthetic dataset with precise ground truth and exhaustive relation annotations. They introduced parametric relations (fine-grained representation with parameters) and proto-relations (hypothetical relations for prospective objects).

Result: Using CoPa-SG, various scene graph generation models were compared. They demonstrated improved planning and reasoning capabilities when integrating the new relation types into applications.

Conclusion: CoPa-SG and the new relation concepts advance the accuracy and usability of scene graph methodologies, enriching applications in scene understanding.

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

### [146] [CA-I2P: Channel-Adaptive Registration Network with Global Optimal Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21364)
*Zhixin Cheng,Jiacheng Deng,Xinjun Li,Xiaotian Yin,Bohao Liao,Baoqun Yin,Wenfei Yang,Tianzhu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods, CAA and GOS, to improve image-to-point cloud registration by tackling challenges in feature attention and matching redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current detection-free methods face issues due to feature channel disparities between images and point clouds, as well as redundancy in matching similar structures, which diminishes registration accuracy.

Method: The proposed Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA) enhances intra-modal features to reduce cross-modal sensitivity. The Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS) optimizes matching processes globally rather than locally.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in image-to-point cloud registration, as demonstrated on RGB-D Scenes V2 and 7-Scenes datasets.

Conclusion: The introduction of CAA and GOS effectively addresses key challenges in cross-modal matching, resulting in significant improvements in registration accuracy.

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

### [148] [FastRef:Fast Prototype Refinement for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21398)
*Long Tian,Yufei Li,Yuyang Dai,Wenchao Chen,Xiyang Liu,Bo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FastRef, a framework for improving few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) by refining prototypes using query image statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the limitations of existing FS-IAD methods, which primarily rely on limited normal sample prototypes and overlook the potential of utilizing query image data to make prototypes more representative.

Method: FastRef employs an iterative two-stage process: (1) Characteristic transfer via a transformation matrix and (2) anomaly suppression through prototype alignment using optimal transport. This approach minimizes gaps between initial and refined prototypes.

Result: FastRef, when integrated with methods like PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO, achieves strong performance and computational efficiency across various benchmark datasets (MVTec, ViSA, MPDD, and RealIAD) under 1/2/4-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: FastRef demonstrates its utility in enhancing prototype representativeness and addressing the challenges of anomaly detection in FS-IAD, proving to be both effective and efficient.

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive
prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.
Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and
RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our
approach under 1/2/4-shots.

### [149] [Curve-Aware Gaussian Splatting for 3D Parametric Curve Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21401)
*Zhirui Gao. Renjiao Yi,Yaqiao Dai,Xuening Zhu,Wei Chen,Chenyang Zhu,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a one-stage end-to-end method for reconstructing 3D parametric curves from 2D multi-view edge maps using a novel representation and adaptive topology optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the optimization gap and error accumulation in existing two-stage methods for 3D curve reconstruction, and to improve efficiency and accuracy by streamlining the process into one stage.

Method: The authors propose a bi-directional coupling mechanism combining parametric curves with edge-oriented Gaussian components, termed 'CurveGaussian,' enabling differentiable rendering and direct multi-view optimization. They also introduce adaptive topology optimization capabilities to refine curve structures during training.

Result: The approach outperforms existing two-stage methods, producing cleaner and more robust 3D curve reconstructions while requiring fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The one-stage method proves more efficient and effective than traditional approaches, demonstrating superiority on benchmarks and reducing parameter requirements without compromising reconstruction quality.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XVerse enables fine-grained and independent control over subject identity and attributes in multi-subject text-to-image generation, overcoming challenges like attribute entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high-quality, coherent control over multiple subjects and their semantic attributes (pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation without introducing artifacts or attribute entanglement.

Method: The authors propose XVerse, which transforms reference images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, enabling precise and independent control without disrupting image latents or features.

Result: XVerse provides high-fidelity, editable multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over subject characteristics and attributes.

Conclusion: XVerse represents a substantial improvement in personalized and complex scene generation by eliminating the tradeoff between editability and coherence in multi-subject image synthesis.

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

*Samuel Joutard,Marijn Stollenga,Marc Balle Sanchez,Mohammad Farid Azampour,Raphael Prevost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperSORT addresses heterogeneous biases in medical imaging through a hyper-network predicting UNet parameters from latent vectors. It helps identify systematic biases and erroneous samples effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging datasets often suffer from inconsistent labeling and biases, which can hinder segmentation performance. Identifying and characterizing such biases is crucial but challenging.

Method: HyperSORT introduces a hyper-network that predicts UNet segmentation parameters based on latent vectors representing image and annotation variability. Training jointly optimizes hyper-network parameters and latent vectors for the data.

Result: HyperSORT successfully maps datasets to detect systematic biases and noisy samples. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets like AMOS and TotalSegmentator highlight its effectiveness in clustering and segmentation under biased conditions.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel way to uncover biases in medical imaging datasets and robustly handle segmentation with meaningful parameter adjustments. The study makes both the methodology and dataset analysis publicly accessible.

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

TL;DR: The paper presents a benchmark study for classifying atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) in breast cancer using deep learning models, reaching high classification accuracy with fine-tuned techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in identifying atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) in tumor malignancy due to subtle morphology, low prevalence, class imbalance, and inter-rater variability.

Method: Deep learning models (baseline, foundation models with linear probing, and fine-tuning with LoRA) were compared using datasets including the AMi-Br and newly introduced AtNorM-Br and AtNorM-MD datasets.

Result: The best performance was achieved with LoRA-based fine-tuned foundation models, showing average balanced accuracy of 0.8135 (AMi-Br), 0.7696 (AtNorM-Br), and 0.7705 (AtNorM-MD).

Conclusion: Atypical mitosis classification can be effectively addressed using recent advancements in transfer learning and fine-tuning methodologies. The results emphasize the potential of LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++
training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,
0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and
AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for
LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows
that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be
effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning
and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in
this paper in this github repository:

*Mohamed Omran,Dimitris Kalatzis,Jens Petersen,Amirhossein Habibian,Auke Wiggers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for precise object placement in images using a visual map and coarse masks, overcoming challenges associated with text-conditioned generative models. It ensures edit quality in appearance, pose, and location accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise object placement in images is challenging, often requiring complex inputs such as meticulously designed inpainting masks or prompts. Simplifying this process motivates this research.

Method: The paper introduces a conditioning signal combined with a visual map and coarse object masks. By leveraging an inpainting model, it preserves the background intact and allows flexibility in altering shapes and orientations.

Result: The approach was tested in automotive settings, showing effectiveness in tasks evaluating edit quality in appearance, pose, and location accuracy. Fine location control was successfully paired with appearance control for precise object placement.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances object placement in images, demonstrating high-quality placements with controlled pose and appearance, while maintaining background integrity.

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel thermal imaging dataset to support miner detection in emergency scenarios in underground mining, evaluated with various object detection algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underground mining poses safety risks, and robot-aided emergency responses need reliable miner detection capabilities. Current training datasets for miner detection in such environments are insufficient.

Method: The study developed a thermal imaging dataset by systematically capturing mining activities and scenarios, then evaluated object detection algorithms like YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11, and RT-DETR on this dataset.

Result: The paper validates the feasibility of using thermal imaging for miner detection and provides baseline performance metrics for state-of-the-art detection algorithms.

Conclusion: This dataset is a foundational step toward developing miner detection systems for emergencies, advancing robotic assistance in underground mining safety.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

### [155] [Rethinking Oversaturation in Classifier-Free Guidance via Low Frequency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21452)
*Kaiyu Song,Hanjiang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance Classifier-free guidance (CFG) by addressing oversaturation and artifacts caused by high guidance scales through low-frequency signal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high guidance scales in Classifier-free guidance (CFG) lead to oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts in diffusion models.

Method: The proposed Low-Frequency Improved Classifier-Free Guidance (LF-CFG) identifies redundant low-frequency information using an adaptive threshold and reduces their influence via a down-weight strategy.

Result: LF-CFG successfully reduces oversaturation and artifacts across multiple diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion variants and SiT-XL.

Conclusion: The LF-CFG method improves the balance in diffusion models, effectively mitigating oversaturation and artifacts through low-frequency signal adjustments.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

### [156] [Evaluation of Traffic Signals for Daily Traffic Pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21469)
*Mohammad Shokrolah Shirazi,Hung-Fu Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study develops vision-based tracking and proposes dynamic, static, and hybrid traffic signal configurations for better traffic flow management at intersections. It evaluates these methods using simulations and suggests that hybrid methods excel in handling bimodal traffic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective traffic signal design and management at intersections using turning movement count (TMC) data for improved traffic flow and congestion analysis.

Method: Developing a vision-based tracking system to estimate TMC data, creating signal configurations (dynamic, static, hybrid), and evaluating their performance using the Simulation of Urban Mobility framework.

Result: Experimental results show that hybrid signal methods perform well in scenarios with bimodal daily traffic flows, particularly under zone-specific traffic pattern distributions, while static methods work best for evenly distributed traffic.

Conclusion: Hybrid traffic signal configurations are effective in managing peak and off-peak conditions by adapting signal timing dynamically, especially for intersections with uneven traffic distributions across zones.

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning hierarchical structures in vision-language models and improving upon existing methods' inability to explicitly model transitive entailment.

Method: The proposed RCME framework optimizes the partial order of concepts, modeling hierarchical structures explicitly and enforcing transitivity within vision-language models.

Result: RCME demonstrates improved performance in hierarchical species classification and retrieval tasks compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: This novel approach effectively models hierarchies in vision-language representations and achieves state-of-the-art results, showing practical utility for tasks like hierarchical classification.

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation
model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our
experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval
tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at

### [158] [TITAN: Query-Token based Domain Adaptive Adversarial Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21484)
*Tajamul Ashraf,Janibul Bashir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD) by introducing TITAN, a method to handle domain shifts using a student-teacher framework and target partitioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the issue of performance degradation in domain adaptive object detection caused by noisy pseudo-labels due to domain shifts.

Method: TITAN separates target images into 'easy' and 'hard' subsets based on detection variance and incorporates query-token-based adversarial modules into a student-teacher framework to reduce domain gaps.

Result: TITAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to +22.7% mAP improvement on four natural imaging benchmarks and notable performance on medical datasets.

Conclusion: TITAN demonstrates the effectiveness of partitioning target data and adversarial training in solving the SF-DAOD problem, proving to be a superior solution in reducing domain bias.

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

### [159] [Towards Reliable Detection of Empty Space: Conditional Marked Point Processes for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21486)
*Tobias J. Riedlinger,Kira Maag,Hanno Gottschalk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a statistical framework for object detection that improves confidence estimates for both detected objects and non-object areas, addressing safety risks in scenarios like automated driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object detection models fail to provide calibrated confidence estimates and do not assess uncertainty in areas without detected objects, which poses safety risks in applications such as automated driving.

Method: The paper introduces an object detection approach based on marked point processes and spatial statistics to model bounding box occurrence and its spatial extension. This enables likelihood-based training and confidence estimation for drivable regions.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates improved calibration of confidence scores and enhanced performance, particularly in evaluating whether regions are obstacle-free.

Conclusion: The object detection model with a statistical framework not only provides task-specific performance but also integrates probabilistic foundations for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

### [160] [Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21509)
*Jiahe Chen,Jiaying He,Qian Shao,Qiyuan Chen,Jiahe Ying,Hongxia Xu,Jintai Chen,Jianwei Zheng,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on a novel framework called Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC) for mitigating textual hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) during inference without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often suffer from hallucination issues—mismatched or contradictory text and visual data—which compromises their reliability and practical usability.

Method: DLC evaluates token logits dynamically using CLIP-based alignment metrics to guide visual grounding, implementing adaptive weighting for balancing visual guidance without requiring extra training or passes.

Result: Experiments across multiple LVLM architectures demonstrate DLC's effectiveness in reducing hallucinations, outperforming existing methods while preserving inference efficiency.

Conclusion: DLC provides an efficient and training-free solution to enhance multimodal accuracy for LVLMs, improving their reliability in practice.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

*Wentao Hu,Shunkai Li,Ziqiao Peng,Haoxian Zhang,Fan Shi,Xiaoqiang Liu,Pengfei Wan,Di Zhang,Hui Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GGTalker introduces a method for creating high-quality, generalizable 3D talking heads by using generalized priors and identity-specific adaptation, achieving photorealistic videos without requiring extensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of generating speech-driven 3D talking heads that can handle large head movements, diverse audio inputs, and avoid time-intensive, identity-specific training.

Method: GGTalker implements a two-stage Prior-Adaptation training strategy to model universal lip movements and general head textures, followed by identity-specific adjustments. It introduces a color MLP for detailed textures and a Body Inpainter for blending results into backgrounds.

Result: The proposed method delivers state-of-the-art results in quality, 3D consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency, overcoming limitations of prior approaches.

Conclusion: GGTalker successfully synthesizes photorealistic, generalizable 3D talking heads by combining universal priors with individualized adaptation, addressing key constraints of existing methods.

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

*Mohammed Rakib,Arunkumar Bagavathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a framework to address multimodal learning challenges, specifically modality imbalance. It ensures that weaker modalities are effectively utilized, enhancing overall model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the issue of modality imbalance in multimodal learning, where stronger modalities dominate and weaker ones are underutilized.

Method: The method involves the Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D) framework, which uses a custom loss function integrating unimodal and multimodal objectives. Additionally, it employs a dynamic sequential modality prioritization technique to balance modality contributions during learning.

Result: The proposed G$^{2}$D framework improves the significance of weaker modalities in training and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets in classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: G$^{2}$D enhances multimodal learning by addressing modality imbalance, leading to better model performance and effective utilization of all modalities. The approach is validated experimentally and publicly available for broader use.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

*Polina Karpikova,Daniil Selikhanovych,Kirill Struminsky,Ruslan Musaev,Maria Golitsyna,Dmitry Baranchuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MADrive, a framework for improved scene reconstruction in autonomous driving environments by augmenting vehicle representations via a large-scale memory bank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving scene reconstructions are currently limited in creating novel or significantly modified driving scenarios realistically.

Method: MADrive uses a memory bank of ~70K 360° car videos (MAD-Cars dataset) to replace observed vehicles with visually similar 3D assets, involving retrieval, 3D reconstruction, and scene integration methods.

Result: The system generates reconstructed vehicle assets with full multi-view representations and enables photorealistic synthesis of altered driving scenes.

Conclusion: MADrive extends current scene reconstruction methods, making photorealistic, flexible, and novel driving scene generation possible for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WAFT is a new high-resolution warping method for optical flow, achieving top accuracy and speed without cost volume construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optical flow models rely on constructing cost volumes, which can be memory-intensive and introduce inductive biases. This paper challenges the assumption that cost volumes are necessary for achieving strong performance.

Method: The authors replace cost volumes with high-resolution warping in a meta-architecture similar to RAFT, allowing significant memory savings and performance improvements.

Result: WAFT ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks and achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x faster compared to methods with similar performance.

Conclusion: WAFT offers a simple, flexible, and efficient alternative to traditional cost-volume-based methods for optical flow and sets new benchmarks in both accuracy and speed.

Abstract: We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective
method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with
high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This
design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is
necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible
meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs.
Compared with existing methods, WAFT ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks,
achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x
faster than methods with similar performance. Code and model weights are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in cross-modal image-text retrieval by enhancing set-based representations with new optimization and loss functions, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve cross-modal image-text retrieval by addressing the limitations of single-vector and multi-vector set-based approaches, specifically focusing on leveraging the latter to better capture diverse relationships while overcoming sparse supervision and set collapse.

Method: The proposed method introduces Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity for matching embedding sets and two novel loss functions: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction between embeddings and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to avoid set collapse.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets MS-COCO and Flickr30K, outperforming other approaches without the need for external data.

Conclusion: Set-based approaches can achieve superior results in diverse cross-modal retrieval, provided sparse supervision and set collapse are mitigated through targeted optimization and tailored loss functions.

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StruMamba3D, a new method for point cloud representation learning, improves upon Mamba-based approaches by addressing limitations in spatial dependencies and sequence memory, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based methods for point cloud representation learning face challenges in spatial adjacency disruption and long-sequence memory retention, necessitating improvements.

Method: StruMamba3D introduces spatial states to maintain dependencies among 3D points, enhances SSM with state-wise updates and lightweight convolution for structure modeling, and incorporates a sequence length-adaptive strategy.

Result: StruMamba3D achieves SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 92.75% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, outperforming prior approaches and excelling in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses key limitations in Mamba-based models, offering a more efficient and accurate approach for self-supervised point cloud representation learning.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40
and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without
voting strategy.

*Yansong Qu,Shaohui Dai,Xinyang Li,Yuze Wang,You Shen,Liujuan Cao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an approach to generate consistent 3D reconstructions from partially occluded single images by synthesizing multiple views directly, bypassing the need for prior inpainting or annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D reconstruction from single images struggle with real-world occlusions, leading to inconsistent views and poor reconstruction quality.

Method: The proposed approach uses a self-supervised learning pipeline trained with occluded-unoccluded image pairs and pseudo-ground-truth views to synthesize six consistent novel views, enabling occlusion-aware 3D reconstruction.

Result: The method successfully synthesizes structurally consistent views from partially occluded inputs and introduces a novel benchmark to standardize evaluation for occlusion-aware reconstruction.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses occlusion challenges in 3D reconstruction, enabling end-to-end multi-view synthesis and establishing a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

Method: The authors introduce SiM3D, a novel dataset featuring multiview, multimodal high-resolution images, point clouds, and CAD models. It also includes manually annotated segmentation ground truths for anomalies.

Result: The paper establishes baselines by adapting singleview methods to multiview scenarios and provides metrics for evaluating performance on voxel-based anomaly volumes.

Conclusion: SiM3D sets a precedent as the first integrated benchmark for multiview and multimodal 3D anomaly detection and segmentation, offering valuable tools and datasets for research advancement.

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of
multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and
segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or
synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the
first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic
training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview
dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset
features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points)
for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each
type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test
samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS
task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using
novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A distributed data analysis framework enables faster, memory-efficient exploration of large-scale GPU profiler performance logs, addressing scalability issues of traditional tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools struggle with the memory and runtime requirements to analyze large-scale GPU profiler logs, especially in HPC workflows with increasing trace complexity.

Method: The framework processes independently analyzable shards concurrently across MPI ranks, reducing memory pressure and eliminating central bottlenecks in data processing.

Result: The system successfully diagnoses performance variability and identifies the impact of memory transfer latency on GPU kernel behavior in realistic HPC and AI workloads.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances scalability and usability in performance analysis, making it apt for high-dimensional GPU profiler data in demanding workflows.

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale performance logs from GPU profilers often requires
terabytes of memory and hours of runtime, even for basic summaries. These
constraints prevent timely insight and hinder the integration of performance
analytics into automated workflows. Existing analysis tools typically process
data sequentially, making them ill-suited for HPC workflows with growing trace
complexity and volume. We introduce a distributed data analysis framework that
scales with dataset size and compute availability. Rather than treating the
dataset as a single entity, our system partitions it into independently
analyzable shards and processes them concurrently across MPI ranks. This design
reduces per-node memory pressure, avoids central bottlenecks, and enables
low-latency exploration of high-dimensional trace data. We apply the framework
to end-to-end Nsight Compute traces from real HPC and AI workloads, demonstrate
its ability to diagnose performance variability, and uncover the impact of
memory transfer latency on GPU kernel behavior.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ClusterRCA is a novel framework for diagnosing network failures in HPC systems using multimodal data, classifier-based, and graph-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in network failure diagnosis in HPC systems due to data heterogeneity and lack of accuracy in existing methods.

Method: ClusterRCA extracts features from connected NIC pairs, uses a classifier-based approach, constructs a failure graph, and applies a customized random walk to identify root causes.

Result: ClusterRCA demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing network failures using datasets from a global HPC device vendor and proved robust across varied application scenarios.

Conclusion: ClusterRCA effectively localizes culprit nodes and failure types, improving the reliability and performance of HPC systems.

Abstract: Network failure diagnosis is challenging yet critical for high-performance
computing (HPC) systems. Existing methods cannot be directly applied to HPC
scenarios due to data heterogeneity and lack of accuracy. This paper proposes a
novel framework, called ClusterRCA, to localize culprit nodes and determine
failure types by leveraging multimodal data. ClusterRCA extracts features from
topologically connected network interface controller (NIC) pairs to analyze the
diverse, multimodal data in HPC systems. To accurately localize culprit nodes
and determine failure types, ClusterRCA combines classifier-based and
graph-based approaches. A failure graph is constructed based on the output of
the state classifier, and then it performs a customized random walk on the
graph to localize the root cause. Experiments on datasets collected by a
top-tier global HPC device vendor show ClusterRCA achieves high accuracy in
diagnosing network failure for HPC systems. ClusterRCA also maintains robust
performance across different application scenarios.

### [171] [Utility-Driven Speculative Decoding for Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20675)
*Anish Saxena,Po-An Tsai,Hritvik Taneja,Aamer Jaleel,Moinuddin Qureshi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper identifies bottlenecks in using speculative decoding for MoEs due to increased data movement and proposes a dynamic framework, Cascade, to optimize its utility for MoEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding, effective in dense LLMs, struggles with emerging Mixture of Experts (MoE) models due to increased data movement and verification time, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: Cascade dynamically tunes the number of tokens (K) and enables/disables speculation based on a utility metric (ratio of token gain to verification cost). It uses periodic evaluation to optimize runtime decisions.

Result: Cascade reduces slowdown to 5% (from 1.5x) and improves throughput by 7-14% compared to static K, making speculative decoding more viable for MoEs.

Conclusion: While speculative decoding is impractical for MoEs as-is, the proposed Cascade framework makes it feasible and beneficial by balancing utility and overhead dynamically.

Abstract: GPU memory bandwidth is the main bottleneck for low-latency Large Language
Model (LLM) inference. Speculative decoding leverages idle GPU compute by using
a lightweight drafter to propose K tokens, which the LLM verifies in parallel,
boosting token throughput. In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are
fetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging
Mixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token,
greatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is
ineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights,
increasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput
gains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x,
making it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model,
and even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense
LLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.
  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables
speculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE
serving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of
token gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality,
enabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each
request, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during
testing, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the
utility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and
evaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math,

improves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding
practical for MoEs.

*Måns I. Andersson,Martin Karp,Niclas Jansson,Stefano Markidis*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of the DaCe framework to automate code generation for efficient execution on various HPC architectures, particularly focusing on a CFD kernel in the Neko solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of increasing hardware diversity in HPC systems, which necessitates architecture-specific code and affects the sustainability of large-scale scientific applications.

Method: Leveraging DaCe's Stateful Dataflow Multigraph (SDFG) representation for automatic code generation and integrating the generated code into the Neko computational solver.

Result: The generated code demonstrated portability and high-performance across Nvidia GH200, Nvidia A100, and AMD MI250X GPUs, achieving competitive results.

Conclusion: The work underscores the feasibility of using DaCe to create portable, high-performance solutions, contributing to the sustainability of complex scientific applications on diverse HPC hardware.

Abstract: With the emergence of new high-performance computing (HPC) accelerators, such
as Nvidia and AMD GPUs, efficiently targeting diverse hardware architectures
has become a major challenge for HPC application developers. The increasing
hardware diversity in HPC systems often necessitates the development of
architecture-specific code, hindering the sustainability of large-scale
scientific applications. In this work, we leverage DaCe, a data-centric
parallel programming framework, to automate the generation of high-performance
kernels. DaCe enables automatic code generation for multicore processors and
various accelerators, reducing the burden on developers who would otherwise
need to rewrite code for each new architecture. Our study demonstrates DaCe's
capabilities by applying its automatic code generation to a critical
computational kernel used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Specifically,
we focus on Neko, a Fortran-based solver that employs the spectral-element
method, which relies on small tensor operations. We detail the formulation of
this computational kernel using DaCe's Stateful Dataflow Multigraph (SDFG)
representation and discuss how this approach facilitates high-performance code
generation. Additionally, we outline the workflow for seamlessly integrating
DaCe's generated code into the Neko solver. Our results highlight the
portability and performance of the generated code across multiple platforms,
including Nvidia GH200, Nvidia A100, and AMD MI250X GPUs, with competitive
performance results. By demonstrating the potential of automatic code
generation, we emphasise the feasibility of using portable solutions to ensure
the long-term sustainability of large-scale scientific applications.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces ParEval-Repo, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to translate codebases across GPGPU execution models, finding feasibility in small programs but challenges in larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the developer burden associated with porting and optimizing code for diverse GPGPU architectures using the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Method: The authors propose ParEval-Repo, a novel benchmark and testing framework, and evaluate various LLMs using non-agentic and top-down agentic approaches on compilability, correctness, error categories, and translation costs.

Result: LLMs show promising results in translating small scientific computing applications but face challenges related to building functional systems and managing cross-file dependencies in larger codebases.

Conclusion: LLM translation methods are feasible for small-scale applications but require further improvements to handle the complexities of larger codebases effectively.

Abstract: GPGPU architectures have become significantly diverse in recent years, which
has led to an emergence of a variety of specialized programming models and
software stacks to support them. While portable execution models exist, they
still require significant developer effort to port to and optimize for
different hardware architectures. Recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) can help us reduce some of this programmer burden. In this paper, we
present a novel benchmark and testing framework, ParEval-Repo, which can be
used to evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based approaches in automatically
translating entire codebases across GPGPU execution models. ParEval-Repo
includes several scientific computing and AI mini-applications in a range of
programming models, and levels of repository complexity. We use ParEval-Repo to
evaluate a range of state-of-the-art open-source and commercial LLMs, with both
a non-agentic and a top-down agentic approach. We assess code generated by the
LLMs and approaches in terms of compilability, functional correctness,
categories of build errors, and the cost of translation in terms of the number
of inference tokens. Our results demonstrate that LLM translation of scientific
applications is feasible for small programs but difficulty with generating
functional build systems and cross-file dependencies pose challenges in scaling
to larger codebases.

*Zhaojiacheng Zhou,Hongze Liu,Shijing Yuan,Hanning Zhang,Jiong Lou,Chentao Wu,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a blockchain-based framework to enhance LLMs by securely coordinating dispersed knowledge silos and addresses the hallucination problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the hallucination problem in LLMs by securely integrating dispersed task-related knowledge while maintaining privacy and security.

Method: A blockchain-based framework is implemented where local data distills into prompts, and mechanisms like reputation systems and cross-validation ensure quality and incentivize participation.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the framework's capability to efficiently share and retrieve knowledge for LLM services within blockchain environments.

Conclusion: The approach provides a secure, efficient, and collaborative solution to improve LLM retrieval tasks by utilizing blockchain-powered knowledge sharing.

Abstract: The hallucination problem of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly
drawn attention. Augmenting LLMs with external knowledge is a promising
solution to address this issue. However, due to privacy and security concerns,
a vast amount of downstream task-related knowledge remains dispersed and
isolated across various "silos," making it difficult to access. To bridge this
knowledge gap, we propose a blockchain-based external knowledge framework that
coordinates multiple knowledge silos to provide reliable foundational knowledge
for large model retrieval while ensuring data security. Technically, we distill
knowledge from local data into prompts and execute transactions and records on
the blockchain. Additionally, we introduce a reputation mechanism and
cross-validation to ensure knowledge quality and provide incentives for
participation. Furthermore, we design a query generation framework that
provides a direct API interface for large model retrieval. To evaluate the
performance of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on
various knowledge sources. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves efficient LLM service knowledge sharing in blockchain environments.

*Ryan Croote,Islam El-Ashi,Thomas Locher,Yvonne-Anne Pignolet*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel architecture for running Turing-complete Bitcoin smart contracts on the Internet Computer (IC), bypassing the need for bridges and associated risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Bitcoin's programmability and the security risks of bridge mechanisms while enabling decentralized applications using Bitcoin.

Method: Integrates Bitcoin and Internet Computer (IC) nodes directly, creating a model to reconcile Bitcoin's probabilistic nature with IC's finalized state changes.

Result: Successful implementation and evaluation of the architecture on mainnet, showing quick finalization and cost-efficiency for complex Bitcoin-based applications.

Conclusion: The architecture overcomes critical technical barriers, enabling new types of Bitcoin-based decentralized applications that were impractical or uneconomical before.

Abstract: There is growing interest in providing programmatic access to the value
locked in Bitcoin, which famously offers limited programmability itself.
Various approaches have been put forth in recent years, with the vast majority
of proposed mechanisms either building new functionality on top of Bitcoin or
leveraging a bridging mechanism to enable smart contracts that make use of
``wrapped'' bitcoins on entirely different platforms.
  In this work, an architecture is presented that follows a different approach.
The architecture enables the execution of Turing-complete Bitcoin smart
contracts on the Internet Computer (IC), a blockchain platform for hosting and
executing decentralized applications. Instead of using a bridge, IC and Bitcoin
nodes interact directly, eliminating potential security risks that the use of a
bridge entails. This integration requires novel concepts, in particular to
reconcile the probabilistic nature of Bitcoin with the irreversibility of
finalized state changes on the IC, which may be of independent interest.
  In addition to the presentation of the architecture, we provide evaluation
results based on measurements of the Bitcoin integration running on mainnet.
The evaluation results demonstrate that, with finalization in a few seconds and
low execution costs, this integration enables complex Bitcoin-based
decentralized applications that were not practically feasible or economically
viable before.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a carbon-aware strategy for microservices, optimizing their version and scaling decisions under hourly carbon budgets to balance user experience, revenue, and carbon constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data centers are increasingly contributing to carbon emissions, and service-oriented cloud applications pose challenges for carbon-aware strategies due to their need for perpetual availability and low latency.

Method: The proposed strategy involves selecting optimal microservice versions and scaling levels, ensuring operations under hourly carbon budgets while maximizing user experience and revenue.

Result: Experiments showcase the adaptability of the approach to various workloads and carbon intensities while respecting budget constraints.

Conclusion: The method successfully balances operational efficiency and carbon concerns for microservices in dynamic settings, offering a viable solution for greener cloud applications.

Abstract: The carbon footprint of data centers has recently become a critical concern.
So far, most carbon-aware strategies have focused on leveraging the flexibility
of scheduling decisions for batch processing by shifting the time and location
of workload executions. However, such approaches cannot be applied to
service-oriented cloud applications, since they have to be reachable at every
point in time and often at low latencies. We propose a carbon-aware approach
for operating microservices under hourly carbon budgets. By choosing the most
appropriate version and horizontal scaleout for each microservice, our strategy
maximizes user experience and revenue while staying within budget constraints.
Experiments across various application configurations and carbon budgets
demonstrate that the approach adapts properly to changing workloads and carbon
intensities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Discovery Space,' a formal abstraction designed to optimize cloud resource configuration for workload deployment, increasing search efficiency and reusability across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing cloud resource configurations for workloads is challenging due to the vast number of parameters and deployment options, necessitating a more structured approach to explore these search spaces.

Method: The researchers propose 'Discovery Space,' a formalized abstraction to describe workload configuration problems, along with its concrete implementation, enabling structured, distributed analysis of large parameter search spaces.

Result: Discovery Space improves optimal configuration searches by enabling data sharing between different optimizers, and knowledge transfer across similar search spaces results in significant speed-ups of over 90%.

Conclusion: Discovery Space provides a systematic way to tackle vast workload configuration problems, enhancing efficiency, transparency, and reusability in optimizing cloud resource deployment.

Abstract: Finding the optimal set of cloud resources to deploy a given workload at
minimal cost while meeting a defined service level agreement is an active area
of research. Combining tens of parameters applicable across a large selection
of compute, storage, and services offered by cloud providers with similar
numbers of application-specific parameters leads to configuration spaces with
millions of deployment options.
  In this paper, we propose Discovery Space, an abstraction that formalizes the
description of workload configuration problems, and exhibits a set of
characteristics required for structured, robust and distributed investigations
of large search spaces. We describe a concrete implementation of the Discovery
Space abstraction and show that it is generalizable across a diverse set of
workloads such as Large Language Model inference and Big Data Analytics.
  We demonstrate that our approach enables safe, transparent sharing of data
between executions of best-of-breed optimizers increasing the efficiency of
optimal configuration detection in large search spaces. We also demonstrate how
Discovery Spaces enable transfer and reuse of knowledge across similar search
spaces, enabling configuration search speed-ups of over 90%.

*Sajid Hussain,Muhammad Sohail,Nauman Ali Khan,Naima Iltaf,Ihtesham ul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL) to optimize federated learning by accounting for dataset size characteristics in heterogeneous data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in federated learning where dataset size characteristics are overlooked, impacting the training dynamics and outcomes.

Method: The authors introduce SAFL, a framework for federated learning that organizes training based on dataset sizes across various modalities. They evaluate it on 13 datasets spanning 7 data modalities.

Result: Key findings include: an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500 samples, better performance of structured data over unstructured data, and performance degradation for datasets over 2000 samples. SAFL achieved an average accuracy of 87.68% across datasets and improved communication efficiency.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights into how dataset size influences federated learning and offers practical guidance for deploying FL strategies in real-world neural network systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing
approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation
techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size
characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces
Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training
framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset
size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive
experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities
(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)
reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500
samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance
hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly
outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic
performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL
achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured
data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior
communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558
communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring
framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization,
network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in
understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning
strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for
real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

TL;DR: E-ABIN is an explainable framework that combines machine learning and deep learning tools for anomaly detection in biological networks, offering predictive accuracy and interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for robust tools to analyze complex gene expression datasets and interpret molecular anomalies distinguishing disease states from healthy controls, emphasizing the limitations of current approaches regarding scalability and accessibility.

Method: E-ABIN integrates machine learning (SVM, Random Forests) and graph-based deep learning models (GAEs, GAANs) into a user-friendly platform for disease-related anomaly detection in gene expression and methylation networks.

Result: The framework was applied to case studies in bladder cancer and coeliac disease, successfully detecting biologically relevant anomalies and providing insights into disease mechanisms.

Conclusion: E-ABIN offers a scalable, interpretable, and accessible platform for identifying molecular anomalies, proving its utility in advancing disease research frameworks.

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust
analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets
while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial
intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns
distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements
in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes
potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene
anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible
graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable
framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines
classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a
unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of
anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating
algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders
(GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a
high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the
utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease,
where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers
insights into disease mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an LLM-based automated system for optimizing GPU kernels through iterative refinements, addressing challenges in new or undocumented architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing GPU kernels requires deep expertise and is especially challenging for newer hardware with limited documentation or resources.

Method: The authors created an LLM-driven methodology that iteratively refines GPU kernels by selecting prior code versions, generating optimization hypotheses, and autonomously testing these through code modifications and timing-based evaluations.

Result: While embargoed quantitative results are not shared, the authors describe their system's design, workflows, and qualitative effectiveness in the context of the AMD MI300 architecture.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of LLM-driven systems to democratize GPU kernel optimization and accelerate the process in evolving or resource-limited hardware scenarios.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often
demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative
experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or
less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are
scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an
automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a)
strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new
iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on
existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c)
autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and
subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed
timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the
challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to
compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were
embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design,
operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of
LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization,
especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) describes how inference under uncertainty is guided by an entropy asymmetry between context and content, proposing a layered computational framework for more efficient problem-solving in brains and machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a fundamental principle—CCUP—that explains how systems minimize uncertainty by strategically aligning high-entropy contexts with structured, low-entropy content in both biological and artificial inference systems.

Method: The paper develops a computational framework with four hierarchical layers of principles: core inference constraints, resource allocation strategies, temporal learning dynamics, and spatial hierarchical composition, supported by theoretical theorems and computational simulations.

Result: The study derives formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among the principles, and demonstrates efficiency gains in CCUP-aligned inference through simulations.

Conclusion: CCUP offers a unified theoretical foundation showing that inference systems like brains increasingly resolve uncertainty by aligning structured content and context through recursive, path-dependent processes.

Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference
under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and
content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with
low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered
computational framework that derives operational principles from this
foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as
directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that
favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four
hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core
Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric
inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,
all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation
Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,
and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping
Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;
and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates
these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and
planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among
principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of
CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for
understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive
structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It
is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and
specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

### [184] [Diffusion Tree Sampling: Scalable inference-time alignment of diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20701)
*Vineet Jain,Kusha Sareen,Mohammad Pedramfar,Siamak Ravanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors propose a novel method called Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS) and a greedy variant DTS$^\star$, which adapt pretrained diffusion models at inference time for improved generative performance with less compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing diffusion model steering methods, which suffer from poor value estimation at high noise levels and inefficient compute usage by not reusing past information.

Method: The method involves framing the alignment of diffusion models as a search problem inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search, where terminal rewards are propagated back through the diffusion chain and value estimates are iteratively refined.

Result: On MNIST and CIFAR-10, the proposed DTS achieves results comparable to the best-performing methods with significantly reduced computational costs (up to $10\times$ less). For text-to-image and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$ achieves competitive high-reward sample generation with up to $5\times$ less compute.

Conclusion: DTS and DTS$^\star$ represent scalable, efficient methods for inference-time alignment of diffusion models by leveraging past computations, making them highly effective in both image and text generation tasks.

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time
remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods
suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which
biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve
sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the
success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting
inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We
introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target
density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and
iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our
proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact
samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its
greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search
for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,
DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less
compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$
effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to
$5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we
get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better
samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of
diffusion models.

### [185] [On Convolutions, Intrinsic Dimension, and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20705)
*Kin Kwan Leung,Rasa Hosseinzadeh,Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends the theoretical foundations of the FLIPD LID estimator by proving its correctness under realistic assumptions, addressing current limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data often lies on low-dimensional submanifolds in highly complex spaces, and understanding the local intrinsic dimension is critical for tasks like outlier detection and analyzing data complexity.

Method: The authors formally prove FLIPD's correctness without limiting it to affine submanifolds and explore the applicability of uniform convolutions alongside Gaussian ones.

Result: FLIPD's theoretical soundness is established under more realistic assumptions, and analogous correctness is demonstrated for uniform convolution-based methods.

Conclusion: This work strengthens the utility and reliability of FLIPD in practical applications of LID estimation, expanding its theoretical scope.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional
ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional
submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with
progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this
process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,
and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.
For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively
expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic
dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari
et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID
to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to
the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID
estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify
the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,
adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art
performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete
since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly
unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap
by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.
Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions
are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Motivation: To investigate whether methodologies successful in mathematical reasoning generalize to advanced theoretical physics and to improve LLM performance in solving scientific problems.

Method: The authors evaluate common test-time scaling methods on the TPBench physics dataset, introduce a symbolic weak-verifier framework, and compare performance against benchmarks like AIME.

Result: Empirical results show that the novel symbolic weak-verifier significantly outperforms existing approaches on the TPBench dataset and is also effective on mathematical reasoning benchmarks like AIME.

Conclusion: Step-wise symbolic verification enhances LLM capabilities in solving complex scientific and mathematical problems, proving its merits over existing techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex
reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with
comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced
theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on
the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on
AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,
symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our
empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical
problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in demonstrating how FMs' cross-domain versatility can address diverse data challenges in materials science, catalyzing breakthroughs in research and discovery.

Method: The paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy for FM applications, reviews relevant datasets and tools, and evaluates successes and limitations of FMs in materials science.

Result: The study highlights both early successes of FMs in various material science applications and underscores limitations such as data imbalance, safety issues, and fusion challenges.

Conclusion: The paper suggests future research avenues like scalable pretraining, continual learning, and enhanced data governance to overcome existing FM limitations in materials science.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials
science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI
systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models,
which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs
offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their
versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research
challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and
computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven
taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction,
interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials
structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization;
and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and
multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents.
Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous
experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration
of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation
models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in
generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and
limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions
centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and
trustworthiness.

### [188] [Multiple Streams of Relation Extraction: Enriching and Recalling in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20746)
*Todd Nief,David Reber,Sean Richardson,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how fine-tuning information propagates in large language models (LLMs), proposing a novel method to study the mechanisms for extracting and recalling relations learned from fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods such as activation patching fail to analyze where information learned during fine-tuning resides in LLMs, due to their disruptive nature in residual streams. Understanding this localization is crucial for transparency and optimization of LLMs.

Method: The authors developed dynamic weight-grafting, which analyzes fine-tuned models by comparing them with pre-trained ones. This approach identifies how information is extracted when processing entities and recalled during generation.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs utilize both "extraction" and "recall" pathways for relation information. The "recall" pathway spans layers near token prediction and involves attention and feedforward outputs. Redundancy and necessity of these pathways vary with tasks.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs leverage dynamic processing pathways to handle learned relation information. Recognizing these pathways provides insights into optimizing model architecture and understanding task-specific information flow.

Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases,
corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when
the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or
are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g.
activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to
replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill
this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained
language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract
relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and
(2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In
some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned
information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway
alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these
information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy
they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the
``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a
relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward
networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

### [189] [Characterization and Mitigation of Training Instabilities in Microscaling Formats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20752)
*Huangyuan Su,Mujin Kwun,Stephanie Gil,Sham Kakade,Nikhil Anand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of low-precision arithmetic formats, specifically NVIDIA's Microscaling (MX) formats, during language model training and examines the associated challenges such as loss instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate the high computational cost and inefficiency of training large language models by exploring low-precision formats for better scalability and efficiency.

Method: A broad analysis of nearly one thousand models trained under varying computational budgets and precision formats is conducted, supplemented by controlled experiments on a proxy model to identify the causes of training instability.

Result: The study identifies stochastic instabilities caused by gradient bias related to quantization in MX formats. Stabilization strategies are proposed, demonstrating that hybrid precision configurations can achieve results close to full-precision training.

Conclusion: MX formats introduce challenges to model training scalability, but strategic adjustments in precision schemes show promise in reducing instabilities and maintaining training efficacy.

Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that
must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is
collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly
support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)
formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a
shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and
perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency
gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of
block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one
thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from
$2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad
range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe
that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the
loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we
conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that
exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural
settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a
simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the
quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of
activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention
experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be
averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these
findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that
certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with
full-precision training. We release our code at
https://github.com/Hither1/systems-scaling.

### [190] [Stochastic and Non-local Closure Modeling for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems via Latent Score-based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20771)
*Xinghao Dong,Huchen Yang,Jin-Long Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a latent space-based generative AI for efficient and accurate modeling of multiscale dynamical systems like turbulent flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems with no clear scale separation, where resolving all scales is computationally expensive.

Method: The method involves combining convolutional autoencoders with conditional latent diffusion models, reducing dimensionality while preserving physical accuracy.

Result: The proposed framework achieves computational acceleration and maintains predictive accuracy, outperforming standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise in enabling efficient and accurate stochastic modeling of complex dynamical systems governed by nonlinearities and multiscale phenomena.

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning
stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear
dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key
challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear
scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively
expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure
modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale
phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in
regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of
diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure
modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical
applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this
limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional
diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the
dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical
characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach
helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small
reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model
in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed
stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves
significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive
accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

### [191] [Stochastic Parameter Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20790)
*Lucius Bushnaq,Dan Braun,Lee Sharkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD), a method for neural network decomposition that is more scalable and robust than the previous Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural network decomposition methods, particularly Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition, are computationally expensive, sensitive to hyperparameters, and impractical for scaling to larger models.

Method: The authors propose Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD), a linear parameter decomposition method that uses stochastic processes to overcome limitations of APD, making it more scalable, effective, and robust to hyperparameters.

Result: SPD successfully decomposes larger and more complex models than APD can handle, avoids issues such as parameter shrinkage, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models.

Conclusion: SPD advances neural network interpretability by enabling scalable and robust decomposition, paving the way for deeper exploration of mechanistic interpretability in larger models.

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into
simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter
decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues
with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into
a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main
method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is
impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter
Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to
hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are
slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We
also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned
parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By
bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this
demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic
interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition
methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing
our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

*Shashwat Khandelwal,Jakoba Petri-Koenig,Thomas B. Preußer,Michaela Blott,Shreejith Shanker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to deploy quantized LSTM models efficiently on FPGAs using the FINN framework for energy-efficient acceleration of recurrent neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in deploying RNNs like LSTMs, which have high computational complexity, on resource-constrained FPGA platforms as existing tools mainly target feed-forward networks.

Method: The authors utilize the FINN framework and introduce custom compiler transformations to map quantized LSTM computations via ONNX specifications onto FPGA hardware blocks.

Result: The approach effectively generated an accelerator for a quantized ConvLSTM model, achieving performance-resource balance and maintaining inference accuracy on stock prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed tool-flow successfully bridges the gap by enabling generalizable, resource-efficient LSTM accelerator designs on FPGAs, paving the way for broader deployment in constrained environments.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for
time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction.
However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time
deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising
platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target
feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom
implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the
open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment
of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open
Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of
LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and
functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom
transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation
graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and
Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM
model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and
generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting
the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator
through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource
consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of
state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the
generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for
resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

### [193] [Optimal Single-Policy Sample Complexity and Transient Coverage for Average-Reward Offline RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20904)
*Matthew Zurek,Guy Zamir,Yudong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores offline reinforcement learning in average-reward Markov Decision Processes, developing guarantees focused on individual target policies and introducing novel metrics for measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address challenges in offline reinforcement learning within average-reward MDPs, specifically the issues of distribution shift, non-uniform coverage, and the lack of theoretical study in this area.

Method: The authors introduce an algorithm utilizing pessimistic discounted value iteration with a novel quantile clipping technique and sharp empirical-span-based penalties.

Result: They achieve single-policy sample complexity bounds tailored to the bias span and policy hitting radius, advance the handling of weakly communicating MDPs, and establish lower bounds consistent with these results.

Conclusion: This work marks a significant theoretical advancement in offline RL for average-reward MDPs by using refined metrics and broader model applicability, eliminating the need for restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which
presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and
non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical
perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under
single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional
complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform
mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy,
specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the
first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline
RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs,
contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve
this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration
enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a
sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not
require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we
show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage
assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy,
distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined
cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

### [194] [An Information-Theoretic Analysis for Federated Learning under Concept Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21036)
*Fu Peng,Meng Zhang,Ming Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies concept drift in federated learning (FL) and proposes an algorithm to improve performance using information theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept drift occurs in real-world data streams under FL, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Concept drift is modeled as Markov chains, introducing Stationary Generalization Error, with regularization using KL divergence and mutual information.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing methods and adapts well to various drift patterns in experiments with Raspberry Pi4.

Conclusion: The algorithm effectively mitigates concept drift in FL, validated by both theoretical analysis and experimental results.

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Hellsemble," a novel, interpretable ensemble learning framework that boosts binary classification performance by leveraging dataset complexity and adapting to instance-level difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods struggle with high computational costs and adaptability to diverse data distributions, creating a need for more efficient and flexible techniques.

Method: Hellsemble incrementally partitions datasets based on instance difficulty, training base models on progressively challenging subsets. A router model assigns new instances to the most suitable base learner.

Result: Experimental results reveal that Hellsemble often outperforms classical ensemble methods on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks, delivering strong classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Instance-level difficulty can significantly enhance the efficiency, robustness, and interpretability of ensemble learning systems, as demonstrated by Hellsemble.

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance,
but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble
selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to
heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose
Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary
classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and
inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of
difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models
to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each
model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router
model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on
inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results
on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often
outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing
instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing
efficient and robust ensemble systems.

### [196] [Universal and Efficient Detection of Adversarial Data through Nonuniform Impact on Network Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20816)
*Furkan Mumcu,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work addresses the detection of adversarial inputs in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by proposing an efficient and universal method that predicts the deeper-layer features from early-layer features and uses prediction errors for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks on DNNs exploit their vulnerability with minimal perturbations, and existing defense methods are often ineffective or computationally expensive, highlighting the need for an efficient detection strategy.

Method: A lightweight regression model predicts deeper-layer features using early-layer features of DNNs, and the prediction error is used to detect adversarial examples.

Result: The proposed detection technique is shown to be effective, computationally efficient for real-time use, adaptable to any DNN architecture, and applicable across different types of data, including images, videos, and audio.

Conclusion: This method provides a practical and universal solution for adversarial example detection, combining efficiency, compatibility, and cross-domain applicability.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

TL;DR: CHOOSE introduces a shallow Transformer model for wireless symbol detection, leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning to improve performance while minimizing computational and storage costs, suitable for resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior Transformer models require deep architectures with significant computational and storage demands, making them impractical for resource-limited wireless communication devices.

Method: CHOOSE uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning in shallow Transformers (1-2 layers) to inject latent autoregressive reasoning steps within the hidden space, enhancing their reasoning capacity without increasing depth.

Result: CHOOSE achieves detection performance comparable to deeper Transformer models while outperforming traditional shallow Transformers in wireless symbol detection tasks, demonstrating its efficiency in computation and storage.

Conclusion: CHOOSE provides a lightweight and effective solution for implementing Transformer-based algorithms on resource-constrained wireless devices, paving the way for practical applications in mobile environments.

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems,
particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks
through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based
Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve
satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational
costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a
CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By
introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space,
CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2
layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight
Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,
making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional
shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep
Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This
represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms
in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

*Xin Huang,Chul-Ho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines distributed GNNs' scalability challenges for link prediction and introduces SpLPG, a sparsification-based method reducing communication costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored performance challenges in distributed GNN frameworks for link prediction, focusing particularly on issues stemming from graph partitioning and negative sampling strategies.

Method: The authors analyze performance degradation due to graph partitions and propose SpLPG, a graph sparsification-based approach that mitigates communication issues while preserving the accuracy of link prediction.

Result: Experiments show SpLPG significantly reduces communication costs by up to 80%, while largely maintaining link prediction accuracy across multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SpLPG proves effective in resolving key bottlenecks in distributed GNN training for link prediction, offering an optimized balance between communication efficiency and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related
problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of
GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node
classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored.
This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by
investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a
GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire
graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the
information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing
negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph
information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction
accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which
effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance
degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several
public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which
reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving
link prediction accuracy.

*Silas Dobler,Florian Lemmerich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new linearity-based compression method for reducing neural network sizes by merging neurons behaving linearly, achieving up to 75% compression without loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compression methods are highly optimized, but new approaches could further enhance size reductions and efficiency in neural networks.

Method: The method leverages the observation that neurons with ReLU-like activations behaving linearly can be merged to reduce model size. Experimental evaluations validate this theory.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to 1/4 of the original model size compression without loss and works well alongside existing importance-based pruning.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel compression approach that complements existing strategies, providing a foundation for developing smaller and more efficient neural networks.

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary
parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly
optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel
way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that
with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated
behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the
theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally.
Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original
model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on
already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between
different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful
combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type
of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural
network models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize time allocation in multi-function cognitive radar to balance scanning and tracking, enhancing radar adaptability and efficiency.

Method: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) were tested to solve a multi-objective optimization problem, supported by NSGA-II to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front.

Result: Both DDPG and SAC proved effective under varying scenarios, with SAC outperforming DDPG in stability and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: SAC offers a more stable and sample-efficient solution for cognitive radar systems, improving adaptability in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The time allocation problem in multi-function cognitive radar systems focuses
on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the
previously detected targets. We formulate this as a multi-objective
optimization problem and employ deep reinforcement learning to find
Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC
showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further
employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of
the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more
efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple
competing objectives in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: LoRA fine-tuning reduces memorization risks in large language models, contrary to trends seen in pre-training and full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning methods like LoRA can influence the memorization and vulnerability to data extraction attacks, but previous findings require reevaluation.

Method: The paper examines memorization during LoRA and full fine-tuning using a similarity-based memorization metric across various influencing factors.

Result: LoRA fine-tuning significantly lowers the risk of memorization compared to full fine-tuning, with little compromise in task performance.

Conclusion: LoRA fine-tuning emerges as a safer method regarding memorization, challenging prior assumptions of data duplication and model scale affecting memorization risk in pre-training.

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) has
revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling models with unprecedented
capabilities in understanding, generating, and processing complex data. These
powerful architectures have transformed a wide range of downstream
applications, tackling tasks beyond human reach. In this paper, we introduce
Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that
applies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a
novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and
lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It
can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit

*Yian Wang,Ali Ebrahimpour-Boroojeny,Hari Sundaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RWFT, a method for erasing a class from a trained classifier without full retraining, while ensuring results comparable to retraining and improving robustness to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient methods for forgetting specific classes in trained models, essential for user deletion rights and reducing harmful/bias patterns, while overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Method: The RWFT approach redistributes prediction probabilities for samples in the forgotten class and proposes a new metric based on total variation distance to measure residual leakage.

Result: RWFT achieves performance comparable to full retraining and surpasses prior methods by 2.79% on traditional metrics and 111.45% on the new TV-based metric.

Conclusion: RWFT demonstrates effectiveness and robustness in erasing classes from models without retraining, setting a new standard in machine unlearning.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

*Erfan Hajihashemi,Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that reduces computational complexity and prediction set sizes while ensuring valid coverage and sublinear regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-model online conformal prediction methods face challenges such as computational complexity and poor performance due to the inclusion of a large number of irrelevant models in the candidate set.

Method: The proposed algorithm uses a bipartite graph feedback system to identify a subset of effective models at each time step, refining the model subset dynamically based on incoming data, and leverages prediction set size as feedback to improve efficiency.

Result: The algorithm reduces computational complexity and constructs smaller prediction sets. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate its superiority over existing methods by achieving better performance while maintaining valid coverage guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances multi-model online conformal prediction by addressing computational and performance challenges, ensuring valid coverage, and achieving sublinear regret while constructing smaller and more efficient prediction sets.

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a
prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a
predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,
multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and
leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the
improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.
A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the
computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with
poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to
unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a
subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a
bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then
selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced
computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we
demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,
can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets
while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms
are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments
on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct
smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal
prediction approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modified LIME approach, DL-LIME, to enhance explainability in deep reinforcement learning applied to radar resource management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inherent "black box" nature of neural networks and improve explainability of decisions in AI-driven radar resource management.

Method: Integrating deep learning into LIME's sampling process to create DL-LIME for improved fidelity and task performance in radar resource management.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate that DL-LIME outperforms traditional LIME in fidelity and task performance, while providing insights into decision-making factors.

Conclusion: DL-LIME enhances the explainability of AI decisions and boosts performance in radar resource management, paving the way for broader applications in explainable AI.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making
processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional
approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM).
However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature
and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI)
techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One
promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between
features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates
deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We
employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource
management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME
in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior
performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors
are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

*Tong Zeng,Srivathsan Badrinarayanan,Janghoon Ock,Cheng-Kai Lai,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent LLM-based framework to optimize chemical processes by autonomously inferring constraints and guiding optimization, achieving faster and efficient results compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck in chemical process optimization caused by the lack of well-defined operational constraints, which often necessitates subjective estimation by engineers.

Method: A framework with specialized large language model (LLM) agents autonomously infers operating constraints and collaboratively performs optimization using OpenAI's o3 model through constraint generation, validation, simulation, and optimization phases.

Result: Validated on a hydrodealkylation process, the framework achieved a 31-fold speedup over grid search, requiring less than 20 minutes to converge while delivering competitive performance on cost, yield, and other metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-driven multi-agent framework offers a promising solution for process optimization in scenarios with poorly characterized constraints, demonstrating superior computational efficiency, reasoning ability, and domain-specific understanding.

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.

*Shahrzad Behzadimanesh,Pierre Le Bodic,Geoffrey I. Webb,Mario Boley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to extend traditional rule ensembles in predictive models by enabling decision regions with oblique faces, using sparse linear transformations of input variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rule ensembles rely on axis-parallel regions for interpretability but require complex rules to achieve higher accuracy in the absence of expressive features, which diminishes interpretability.

Method: The authors propose using sparse linear transformations and logical propositions combined with sequential greedy optimization based on iteratively reweighted logistic regression.

Result: The method achieves similar test risks as state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing model complexity across ten datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy improves rule ensemble models by enhancing interpretability without sacrificing accuracy, offering a balance between model simplicity and predictive performance.

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction
models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on
conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input
variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel
polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of
interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the
gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of
expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of
axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such
features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and
complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the
model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical
propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,
i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where
$\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as
general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using
sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation
of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as
state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across
ten benchmark datasets.

*Keivan Rezaei,Mehrdad Saberi,Abhilasha Ravichander,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes MSA, a new algorithm for efficiently unlearning specific data from large language models by using model checkpoints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for removing problematic, private, or low-quality data from large language models without the costly process of retraining the models entirely.

Method: The authors introduce MSA, a machine unlearning algorithm that utilizes model checkpoints to estimate and remove the influence of specific data points while preserving the model's overall performance.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that MSA performs better than current unlearning algorithms across several benchmarks, models, and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: MSA offers a promising, practical solution for making large language models more flexible and capable of effective data erasure at a low computational cost.

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may
include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data
that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic
datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model
on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally
prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to
eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving
the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and
undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In
this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the
influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts
capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine
unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation
metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more
flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

TL;DR: AbMEGD introduces a novel geometric deep learning framework for antibody design, achieving notable improvements in molecular interactions and structure-function mapping over complex antigens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antibody design faces challenges in capturing molecular structures and generalizing antigen interfaces for therapeutic and diagnostic pursuits.

Method: The paper proposes AbMEGD, utilizing multi-scale equivariant graph diffusion with E(3)-equivariant features to co-design antibody structure and sequence.

Result: Experiments on the SAbDab database showed improved amino acid recovery (+10.13%), increased improvement percentages (+3.32%), and reduced structural deviation (0.062 Å in CDR-H3 region) compared to DiffAb.

Conclusion: AbMEGD sets a new benchmark for sequence-structure co-design, balancing structural integrity with enhanced functionality for antibody modeling.

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark
for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization. The code is

*Yifan Yang,Zhen Zhang,Rupak Vignesh Swaminathan,Jing Liu,Nathan Susanj,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SharpZO introduces a hybrid fine-tuning method for Vision Language Models (VLMs) that eliminates backpropagation, relying only on forward passes, and achieves superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning techniques for VLMs require backpropagation, which is unsuitable for memory-constrained or inference-only edge devices.

Method: SharpZO utilizes a hybrid optimization process with two stages: sharpness-aware evolutionary strategies for initialization and sparse zeroth-order optimization for fine-tuning, relying solely on forward passes.

Result: SharpZO improves accuracy and convergence speed, showing up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art zeroth-order fine-tuning methods, based on experiments on CLIP models.

Conclusion: SharpZO offers an efficient and effective backpropagation-free fine-tuning method for VLMs, which could benefit edge-device applications while improving performance metrics.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally
explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization,
followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire
optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly
improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over
state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

*Steven Walton,Valeriy Klyukin,Maksim Artemev,Denis Derkach,Nikita Orlov,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates using knowledge distillation to improve the efficiency and performance of compositional normalizing flows while maintaining their functionalities in explicit density modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit density models like normalizing flows offer advantages such as exact latent-variable inference and the ability to evaluate sample likelihood. However, these models are often hard to train and yield lower sampling quality, motivating the need for efficient improvements.

Method: The authors propose novel techniques for knowledge distillation in compositional normalizing flows, allowing knowledge transfer within intermediate layers to enhance density estimation and sampling quality in smaller student models.

Result: The study demonstrates that distilled student models can be significantly smaller while achieving better performance than non-distilled counterparts. This leads to higher computational throughput due to reduced model size and parameters.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation in normalizing flows is effective for creating smaller yet performant models, leveraging the unique structure of these flows to facilitate efficient knowledge transfer and enhanced model efficiency.

Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for
generative models because of their ability to better model probability
distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to
their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable
inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply
interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability
distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more
difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective
functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In
this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase
sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.
We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional
Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these
architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a
non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that
knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,
we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance
gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a
proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of
bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

*Prajwal Koirala,Cody Fleming*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSCP proposes a generative policy for RL that achieves efficient one-shot action generation, improving speed and stability over existing diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models for RL enable multimodal action distributions but suffer from high inference costs and training instability caused by backpropagating through multiple sampling steps.

Method: The paper introduces the Single-Step Completion Policy (SSCP), which uses an augmented flow-matching objective to train policies to predict direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples. This eliminates iterative sampling and long backpropagation chains.

Result: SSCP significantly outperforms diffusion-based baselines across offline RL, offline-to-online RL, and online RL tasks, while being faster and more adaptable. It also extends to goal-conditioned RL, achieving high performance in benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSCP combines the expressiveness of generative policies with the efficiency of unimodal policies, making it a scalable solution for various RL tasks and sequential decision-making challenges.

Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive
policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal
action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference
costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling
steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a
generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict
direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate,
one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP
combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and
inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long
backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline,
offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed
and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to
goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures
without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across
standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a
versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential
decision-making.

*Feng Jiang,Mangal Prakash,Hehuan Ma,Jianyuan Deng,Yuzhi Guo,Amina Mollaysa,Tommaso Mansi,Rui Liao,Junzhou Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRIDENT, a multimodal framework combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic data to improve molecular property prediction. It achieves state-of-the-art results in 11 downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior molecular property prediction methods overlooked the benefits of textual and taxonomic data, leaving an opportunity to enhance representation learning by integrating multiple modalities.

Method: TRIDENT integrates molecular SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic annotations. It uses a volume-based global alignment objective, a novel local alignment mechanism, and a momentum-based approach to balance global and local alignments. This allows for better understanding of both broad and detailed relationships between structure and function.

Result: TRIDENT outperformed competing methods in multiple performance benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results in 11 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The use of tri-modal data—SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations—offers a richer representation for molecular property prediction, with TRIDENT proving to be highly effective for this purpose.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical
structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely
overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation
learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular
SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn
rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive
dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional
annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT
employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features
at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities.
Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that
captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their
corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically
balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad
functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the
value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for
molecular property prediction.

*Haodong Lu,Chongyang Zhao,Jason Xue,Lina Yao,Kristen Moore,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoRA, a fine-grained, rank-adaptive learning method to address challenges in continual learning with pre-trained models, including catastrophic forgetting, task interference, and redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting, task interference, redundancy, and ambiguous routing when using LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for continual learning with pre-trained models.

Method: The authors propose MoRA, which decomposes rank-r updates into rank-1 components treated as independent experts. This allows fine-grained rank utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. It also includes rank pruning, activation budgets, and self-activated routing.

Result: MoRA demonstrated improvements in in-domain continual learning and out-of-domain generalization while mitigating forgetting in experiments with CLIP and large language models.

Conclusion: MoRA effectively enhances continual learning and generalization for pre-trained models by addressing interference, redundancy, and ambiguous routing in existing approaches.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by
catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and
freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and
ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design
introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts
per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful
components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or
contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks
and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features
across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As
more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating
forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with
self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple
low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,
each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1
expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid
ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own
relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning
and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per
input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large
language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain
forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant
effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while
mitigating forgetting.

*Suorong Yang,Peijia Li,Furao Shen,Jian Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RL-Selector, an RL-based data selection method to improve training efficiency by reducing dataset redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational and storage costs of training deep models on large datasets, particularly given real-world data redundancies.

Method: Proposes RL-Selector, utilizing the concept of epsilon-sample cover and a lightweight RL agent to dynamically select representative data samples during training.

Result: RL-Selector outperforms state-of-the-art data selection methods in experiments across benchmark datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: The method enhances model generalization performance while significantly improving training efficiency through better data selection.

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world
datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more
data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate
redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing
training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically
rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined
effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We
introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample
redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic
structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a
reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a
lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging
epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward
signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse
architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show
enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

*Jaebak Hwang,Sanghyeon Lee,Jeongmo Kim,Seungyul Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL framework designed to address challenges in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks, offering improved exploration and planning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in long-horizon RL tasks where goals are distant and rewards are sparse, addressing issues like subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning associated with hierarchical and graph-based methods.

Method: Developed SSE, a hierarchical RL framework enforcing single-step subgoal reachability, employing a decoupled exploration policy for systematic goal space exploration and failure-aware path refinement to dynamically adjust edge costs based on subgoal reliability.

Result: Experimental evaluations show SSE consistently outperforms existing approaches in efficiency and success rates across long-horizon benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSE provides a robust solution for long-horizon goal-conditioned RL tasks by improving subgoal feasibility and reliability, enhancing planning and exploration efficiency.

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards
are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions,
they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We
introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL
framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally
constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a
decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored
regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which
refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to
observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability.
Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that
SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL
approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

### [218] [Efficient Skill Discovery via Regret-Aware Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21044)
*He Zhang,Ming Zhou,Shaopeng Zhai,Ying Sun,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new skill discovery method for reinforcement learning using a regret-aware strategy to address efficiency limitations in high-dimensional scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning often emphasize exploration but struggle with efficiency in complex, high-dimensional environments.

Method: The authors frame skill discovery as a min-max game between skill generation and policy learning, using regret scores and a learnable skill generator to prioritize weak or converged skills while maintaining diversity.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved efficiency and diversity, with a 15% zero-shot performance gain in high-dimensional environments compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances skill discovery efficiency and diversity, offering significant advantages in high-complexity scenarios.

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable
behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they
focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information
optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform
well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for
the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a
min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware
method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered
skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight
behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the
policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored
while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an
implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and
guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid
degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill
generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities
and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15%
zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing
methods.

*Fu Peng,Ming Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedDAA, a dynamic clustered federated learning framework to address concept drift caused by temporal and spatial data heterogeneity in clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in federated learning inadequately handle multi-source concept drift, including virtual and label drift, often leading to catastrophic forgetting.

Method: FedDAA contains three key modules: cluster number determination, real drift detection, and concept drift adaptation to improve learning and retention of historical knowledge.

Result: FedDAA exhibited 7.84%–8.52% accuracy improvements over existing methods, validated through experiments on datasets like Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: FedDAA effectively adapts to multi-source concept drift in federated learning and preserves valuable historical knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change
over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as
concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift
(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the
input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution
P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily
focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these
methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading
to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different
sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift
calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from
retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a
general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To
address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework
designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable
historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster
number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real
drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and
a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful
historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and
experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

*Jingwei Wang,Zai Zhang,Hao Qian,Chunjing Gan,Binbin Hu,Ziqi Liu,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou,Bin Shi,Bo Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using knowledge graphs to create high-quality instruction data for large language models (LLMs), improving their ability to effectively utilize tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLMs' problem-solving capabilities and expand their real-world applications, teaching them effective tool usage—an area hindered by poor-quality instruction data—is vital.

Method: Utilize knowledge graphs to generate instruction data by extracting query pathways, translating entity relationships into actionable tools, and parsing these pathways into detailed solution steps.

Result: Experiments reveal that fine-tuning LLMs on even a small sample of the generated synthetic data leads to significant improvements in tool utilization and general capabilities.

Conclusion: Using knowledge graphs to produce rich instruction data is an effective approach to enhance tool usage and problem-solving ability in LLMs.

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of
LLMs.

*Xenia Heilmann,Luca Corbucci,Mattia Cerrato,Anna Monreale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness in Federated Learning (FL), proposing resources to benchmark FL methods under heterogeneous client biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the fairness issues caused by biases and heterogeneous data distributions across clients in FL.

Method: They developed FeDa4Fair, a library for creating tabular datasets, released benchmark datasets, and offered evaluation tools for fairness research.

Result: Created benchmarking resources for fairness evaluation in FL, including datasets and functions.

Conclusion: The contribution facilitates consistent and reproducible fairness research in FL by standardizing resources to address client bias.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key
concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated
system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that
are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing
solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a
single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and
sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited
perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the
different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in
FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at
both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:
(1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to
evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four
bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness
mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use
functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

*David Debot,Pietro Barbiero,Gabriele Dominici,Giuseppe Marra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hierarchical Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a concept-based model that enhances interpretability for both concept and task predictions using a directed acyclic graph and neural attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability in black-box neural networks used for concept predictions in existing Concept-Based Models (CBMs).

Method: The method involves using a learned directed acyclic graph to model relationships between concepts and a neural attention mechanism to hierarchically apply logic rules for concept and task predictions.

Result: H-CMR achieves state-of-the-art performance while allowing for human interactions that improve inference accuracy and data efficiency during training.

Conclusion: H-CMR advances the interpretability and utility of CBMs by not only matching top performance but also enabling interventions that benefit both inference and training processes.

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide
interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These
models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task.
However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task
prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via
black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for
both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts
using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that
define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a
neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then
applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental
results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while
enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The
former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter
can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is
available.

### [223] [Learning to Skip the Middle Layers of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21103)
*Tim Lawson,Laurence Aitchison*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Transformer architecture that skips layers dynamically based on redundancy insights but does not significantly outperform dense baselines in trade-off metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve Transformer efficiency by leveraging observed redundancy in middle layers and aggregative tendencies in early layers.

Method: Dynamic layer skipping with a learned gating mechanism, gated attention, perilayernorm scheme, and adaptive regularization loss.

Result: The architecture did not achieve better validation cross-entropy vs. FLOPs trade-offs compared to simpler dense baseline models.

Conclusion: The approach highlights potential, but lacks significant gains at the tested scale. Code is released for further exploration.

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

*Changxi Chi,Jun Xia,Yufei Huang,Jingbo Zhou,Siyuan Li,Yunfan Liu,Chang Yu,Stan Z. Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "DDIB", a novel framework using Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges to map unpaired single-cell data before and after perturbation, enhancing understanding of gene responses under experimental conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-cell sequencing is essential for studying responses to perturbations but is inherently destructive, preventing paired observations for the same cell under perturbed and unperturbed conditions.

Method: The authors utilize a dual conditional diffusion model (Unlasting), incorporating a gene regulatory network (GRN) to biologically propagate signals, augmenting data with masking mechanisms for silent gene predictions and introducing a tailored evaluation metric.

Result: The proposed approach addresses the challenge of modeling unpaired data, improves single-cell gene profile generation, and better captures biological heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The DDIB framework effectively maps responses across perturbations, integrating GRN insights to enhance profile generation and introduces a biologically meaningful metric to understand cell heterogeneity for drug screening.

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

### [225] [Robust Policy Switching for Antifragile Reinforcement Learning for UAV Deconfliction in Adversarial Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21127)
*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an antifragile RL framework to enhance UAV adaptability against adversarial attacks using a dynamic policy-switching mechanism via discounted Thompson sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust RL methods struggle with generalizing to out-of-distribution shifts and handling dynamic adversarial attacks in UAV navigation systems.

Method: The framework creates a diverse ensemble of robust policies modeled as a multiarmed bandit problem, employing discounted Thompson sampling to dynamically select the optimal policy against adversarial strategies.

Result: Numerical simulations showed superior performance in UAV navigation under adversarial conditions—achieving shorter paths and higher conflict-free rates compared to non-adaptive robust RL methods.

Conclusion: The antifragile RL approach effectively adapts to evolving adversarial attacks, showing promise for enhancing UAV autonomy and resilience.

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior
performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of
conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an "antifragile reinforcement learning" framework that improves the robustness of RL policies in safety-critical systems by enabling them to adapt to adversarial observation-space perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of RL policies, particularly in safety-critical applications like UAV navigation, to out-of-distribution adversarial attacks that compromise decision-making and safety.

Method: The authors present a framework where a simulated attacker incrementally introduces adversarial perturbations in the observation space. This enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize through bounds enforced via expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance minimization.

Result: The antifragile RL framework outperforms standard and robust RL baselines in UAV navigation tasks when facing adversarial attacks, achieving metrics like a 15% improvement in cumulative reward and 30% fewer conflict events.

Conclusion: Antifragile reinforcement learning shows both theoretical and practical effectiveness in enhancing resilience and security in RL systems, particularly in dynamic and adversarial environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative
reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the
practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for
secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat
scenarios.

*Andrey Goncharov,Daniil Vyazhev,Petr Sychev,Edvard Khalafyan,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient fine-tuning framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that leverages entropy-based data classification to outperform traditional fine-tuning and reduce data requirements in distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning general-purpose LLMs for specific domains is challenging due to the resource-intensive nature of distillation approaches requiring vast amounts of data.

Method: The authors classify training data by single token answer entropy, use complexity categories for reasoning steps, and apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and distillation on small open models.

Result: The proposed pipeline exceeds standard SFT performance (0.55 vs 0.43 average accuracy) and achieves distillation-like performance while using 62% less data.

Conclusion: The method offers an effective and efficient strategy for fine-tuning LLMs, balancing performance and resource constraints. The published code and data aim to promote research in this area.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

*Weikang Meng,Yadan Luo,Liangyu Huo,Yaowei Wang,Xin Li,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Norm-Aware Linear Attention (NaLaFormer) to tackle issues in linear attention regarding entropy gap and neglected query norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention shows promise in reducing computational complexity but faces challenges like entropy gap and missing query-key interactions.

Method: NaLaFormer decouples query and key matrices into norm and direction, employs query-norm aware kernel functions, and projects angular matrices to positive values using cosine similarity.

Result: NaLaFormer shows improved performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2%.

Conclusion: NaLaFormer effectively addresses linear attention's challenges, providing better expressiveness and efficiency while maintaining entropy reduction and consistency.

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by
reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve
two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,
current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$
normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected
by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily
leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of
query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after
being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware
Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and
recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple
query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve
norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We
mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the
query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel
function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure
norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a
norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into
positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with
opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the
NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both
expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of training massive foundation models (e.g., LLMs) on less-reliable, slower, decentralized clusters instead of centralized, high-speed networks.

Method: Using three core strategies: Pipeline Parallelism with Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme.

Result: Demonstrated successful pre-training of a 107B parameter model over a 1Gbps network with a 357x speedup compared to vanilla AllReduce and negligible convergence degradation.

Conclusion: DiLoCoX is the first effective framework enabling decentralized training of 100B+ parameter models, making large-scale distributed training feasible on slower networks.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100
billion parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DBConformer, a dual-branch convolutional Transformer, improves EEG-based decoding accuracy and interpretability with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of CNNs in capturing long-range temporal dependencies and inter-channel relationships in EEG decoding, as well as the suboptimal integration of features in existing CNN-Transformer hybrids.

Method: DBConformer introduces a dual-branch design with temporal and spatial Conformers to model temporal dynamics and inter-channel interactions, accompanied by a channel attention mechanism for refining spatial representations.

Result: DBConformer outperforms 10 baseline models across seven EEG datasets with over eight times fewer parameters than a high-capacity baseline while providing physiologically interpretable features.

Conclusion: DBConformer is a reliable, efficient, and interpretable approach for EEG decoding, effectively addressing existing challenges and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform
spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external
communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream
backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it
difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel
relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address
this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration
of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch
convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a
temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial
Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal
dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention
module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven
importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)
datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings
demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline
models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG
Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the
features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned
with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability
of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code
is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.

Motivation: Traditional IDS methods fail to identify novel threats and distinguish stealthy adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events.

Method: The paper introduces a cGAN-based framework to generate adversarial attacks, combined with a CVAE utilizing negative log-likelihood to detect them.

Result: The CVAE-based detection approach outperforms conventional methods like Mahalanobis distance-based detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats.

Conclusion: Advanced probabilistic modeling, such as CVAE-based approaches, strengthens IDS capabilities against adaptive cyber intrusions.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

### [232] [Personalized Federated Learning via Dual-Prompt Optimization and Cross Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21144)
*Yuguang Zhang,Kuangpu Guo,Zhihe Lu,Yunbo Wang,Jian Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A proposed framework, pFedDC, improves federated learning's handling of data heterogeneity through dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, leveraging pretrained vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces significant challenges due to data, computation, and communication heterogeneity among clients, and pretrained VLMs offer an efficient avenue to address these issues via prompt tuning.

Method: pFedDC introduces dual-prompt learning by maintaining global and local prompts for vision and language, coupled with a cross-fusion module for personalized representation integration.

Result: The framework demonstrates consistent surpassing of existing state-of-the-art methods across nine heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: pFedDC effectively utilizes pretrained VLMs for personalized federated learning, successfully capturing both shared and client-specific semantics while addressing heterogeneity challenges.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

*Jiajie Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Prototype Routing (LPR) to address severe load imbalances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, achieving significant improvements in expert utilization and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mixture-of-Experts systems suffer from underutilization of model capacity due to severe load imbalance, necessitating solutions for balanced expert activation without hindering performance.

Method: The authors propose Latent Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel framework leveraging clustering and generalizing existing expert routing approaches to ensure balanced utilization of MoE systems.

Result: LPR achieves near-perfect load balancing by reducing the Gini coefficient from 0.70 to 0.035 and improving the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70 across multiple open-source MoE models.

Conclusion: Latent Prototype Routing effectively increases expert utilization and computational efficiency without compromising downstream performance, marking a significant step forward in MoE architectures.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

*Hampus Gummesson Svensson,Ola Engkvist,Jon Paul Janet,Christian Tyrchan,Morteza Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diverse mini-batch selection technique using determinantal point processes in reinforcement learning, demonstrated in drug discovery to enhance solution diversity while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring diverse and high-quality instances is crucial in costly real-world scenarios like reinforcement learning and drug discovery, where evaluation is expensive and essential for effective exploration.

Method: The authors propose using determinantal point processes to select diverse mini-batches in reinforcement learning. They apply the framework to drug discovery, evaluating its impact through molecular generation experiments.

Result: The framework significantly enhances the diversity of solutions without compromising their quality, as shown across three molecular generation oracles and numerous generative steps.

Conclusion: Diverse mini-batch selection not only improves effectiveness in exploration tasks like drug discovery but also potentially accelerates the fulfillment of unmet medication needs.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

*Colin Samplawski,Adam D. Cobb,Manoj Acharya,Ramneet Kaur,Susmit Jha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScalaBL, a method to address uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) using Bayesian inference in a low-dimensional subspace, achieving competitive results while requiring minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate incorrect information and are poorly calibrated. Uncertainty quantification is essential, especially in critical applications like healthcare, but existing methods face scalability issues for large LLMs.

Method: The proposed method, ScalaBL, leverages Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference by using LoRA parameters as projection matrices to perform Bayesian inference in a low-dimensional subspace.

Result: The method achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches and enables scalability to the largest Bayesian LLMs, requiring only about 1000 additional parameters.

Conclusion: ScalaBL addresses key limitations in existing Bayesian uncertainty quantification approaches, improving scalability and efficiency for large LLMs while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Artificial Delegates to address fairness in sequential collective decision-making under partial voter turnout, finding that these agents improve representational equity and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fairness and representational issues in perpetual voting systems caused by partial voter turnout.

Method: The study integrates Artificial Delegates, preference-learning agents representing absent voters, into perpetual voting systems and examines absenteeism's impact on fairness across various voting methods.

Result: Artificial Delegates effectively mitigate the negative effects of absenteeism, improving fairness and system robustness in diverse voting scenarios.

Conclusion: The integration of Artificial Delegates can enhance fairness and representativeness in sequential decision-making systems traditionally affected by partial participation.

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making
by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual
voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information,
assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In
this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates,
preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual
voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and
representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to
which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our
findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness,
Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness
across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of predicting obsolescence risk caused by limited reliable data in electronic component industries.

Method: Proposed utilizing zero-shot learning with large language models while leveraging domain-specific knowledge from tabular datasets.

Result: Demonstrated effective risk predictions using real-world datasets and assessed four LLMs for their effectiveness.

Conclusion: Selecting an appropriate large language model is crucial for improving obsolescence forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Component obsolescence poses significant challenges in industries reliant on
electronic components, causing increased costs and disruptions in the security
and availability of systems. Accurate obsolescence risk prediction is essential
but hindered by a lack of reliable data. This paper proposes a novel approach
to forecasting obsolescence risk using zero-shot learning (ZSL) with large

domain-specific knowledge from tabular datasets. Applied to two real-world
datasets, the method demonstrates effective risk prediction. A comparative
evaluation of four LLMs underscores the importance of selecting the right model

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances randomized seeding methods for k-means clustering and k-GMM, proposing novel initialization techniques, achieving consistent metric improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the initialization phase of clustering algorithms (k-means and k-GMM), addressing the limitations in existing randomized seeding methods.

Method: The authors formalized key seeding components and introduced "lookahead" principles with enhanced coherence and multipass strategies to refine seed selection.

Result: Experiments demonstrated better outcomes compared to classical methods, improving final metrics such as SSE for k-means and log-likelihood for k-GMM.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are both practically effective and theoretically promising as potential standard techniques for clustering initialization.

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM
(Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing
their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of
candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields
novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead
principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the
final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame
down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical
contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for
k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve
on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to
outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means
often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon
seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in
iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool
size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to
become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical
perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of
analytical approaches.

*Galvin Brice S. Lim,Brian Godwin S. Lim,Argel A. Bandala,John Anthony C. Jose,Timothy Scott C. Chu,Edwin Sybingco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AGTCNet, a novel deep learning model for motor imagery EEG classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of developing robust, subject- and session-invariant BCI systems due to neural activity variability and hardware constraints.

Method: AGTCNet, an attentive graph-temporal convolutional network, captures spatiotemporal dependencies in multichannel EEG signals using topographic inductive bias and attention mechanisms.

Result: AGTCNet significantly outperforms existing classifiers, offering smaller model size, faster inference, and higher accuracy for subject-independent and subject-specific MI-EEG classification.

Conclusion: The findings suggest AGTCNet is highly effective, practical, and offers advancements in creating robust BCI systems for motor imagery EEG tasks.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography
(EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals
to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising
potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems
remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability
of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware
constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,
existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate
spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study
addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional
network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)
classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration
of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional
attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG
representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG
classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact
architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI
deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference
time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy
of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV
Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for
subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset,
AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and
2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further
improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynamicBench is a benchmark for large language models (LLMs) aimed at assessing their ability to process up-to-date information using a dual-path retrieval pipeline, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks fail to assess real-time information processing, which is essential for applications requiring up-to-date and domain-specific data.

Method: DynamicBench uses a dual-path retrieval pipeline integrating web searches and local databases to test LLMs in scenarios with and without external document support. It incorporates domain-specific tasks and report generation systems.

Result: DynamicBench demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT-4 by 7.0% in document-free scenarios and 5.8% in document-assisted scenarios based on experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The introduction of DynamicBench provides a robust tool for evaluating LLMs in dynamic information processing tasks, aiding in their development and deployment in contemporary applications.

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on
static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to
capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in
contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and
processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval
pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates
domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within
specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or
withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability
to independently process recent information or leverage contextual
enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system
adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results
confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and
document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data
will be made publicly available.

*Le Vu Anh,Mehmet Dik,Nguyen Viet Anh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how a single eigenvalue of persistent Laplacians changes when a simplex is added, establishing a Lipschitz bound for eigenvalue stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent Laplacians are widely used in various fields, but their eigenvalue response to local updates remained unexplored, impacting their application in tools like spectral neural networks.

Method: The authors derived a uniform Lipschitz bound to quantify the maximum change in eigenvalues of persistent Laplacians after adding a single simplex.

Result: They proved that eigenvalues can vary by at most twice the Euclidean norm of a simplex's boundary, independently of filtration scale and complex size.

Conclusion: This provides the first eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis, ensuring stability under local updates and allowing for error control in dynamic data scenarios.

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and
structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology,
physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of
geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work
established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change
in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle,
is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools,
including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly
on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound:
after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary
by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of
filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first
eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.
It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and
enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SMMILE is introduced as the first expert-driven benchmark for evaluating multimodal in-context learning (ICL) in medical domains. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show moderate to poor performance under this framework and exhibit biases and critical limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of multimodal in-context learning in adaptive and diverse medical tasks, since clinicians often need to adapt insights from limited data using such learning processes.

Method: Created SMMILE, a multimodal ICL benchmark with 111 problems curated by 11 medical experts, including query-answer-image triplets across specialties and modalities. Also introduced an augmented version, SMMILE++, with permuted problems. Evaluated 15 MLLMs under controlled conditions.

Result: Majority of MLLMs exhibit moderate to poor performance on SMMILE and SMMILE++ benchmarks, with only 8-9.4% improvement over zero-shot approaches. Models are sensitive to irrelevant examples, which degrade performance, and show recency biases when ordering examples.

Conclusion: MLLMs currently exhibit significant limitations and biases in performing multimodal medical tasks via in-context learning, requiring further advances to handle medical applications effectively.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite
significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely
encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited
examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or
considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question
answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is
largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL
benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each
including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task
demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer
triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further
introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A
comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit
moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended
evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on
SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant
in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade
performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,
i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial
performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical
limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks
from context.

distributions via MSE, rQdia boosts DrQ and SAC on 9/12 and 10/12 tasks
respectively in the MuJoCo Continuous Control Suite from pixels, and

in both sample efficiency and longer-term training. Moreover, the addition of

TL;DR: The paper explores using error-resilient and approximate hardware techniques to improve energy efficiency in deep neural networks, achieving significant energy savings at the cost of minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing adoption of deep neural networks in diverse applications, there is a demand to reduce their energy consumption, especially for low-power platforms.

Method: The study uses ROUP approximate multipliers with fine-grained distribution (layer-, filter-, and kernel-level) in DNNs to balance energy efficiency and accuracy. ResNet-8 trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset is employed as a test case.

Result: The approach demonstrated up to 54% energy savings with a maximum accuracy loss of 4%. It also doubled energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods while offering superior or comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves a favorable trade-off between energy efficiency and accuracy, proving its viability for energy-constrained DNN applications.

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has
established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine
Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this
paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads
in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher
levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate
multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across
the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and
examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the
CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers
up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the
baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better
accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Finetuning neural networks can be expensive. This paper proposes NANOADAM, which only updates small-magnitude weights during finetuning, reducing costs and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning large neural networks is resource-intensive, and there's a need for efficient methods that mitigate memory and computational demands.

Method: The authors analyze the gradient-weight correlation in finetuning and propose NANOADAM, which selectively updates small-magnitude weights without needing gradient computation.

Result: Experiments across NLP and vision tasks show that NANOADAM maintains critical pretraining features, reduces catastrophic forgetting, permits larger learning rates, and improves generalization performance.

Conclusion: NANOADAM is a resource-efficient finetuning approach that enhances performance while lessening risks like catastrophic forgetting. It is practically advantageous for NLP and vision applications.

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be
resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate
this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model
parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during
finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated
with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning
settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we
propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights
during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this
criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without
gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are
likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing
the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger
learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in
experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that
enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced
temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with
periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention
mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context
attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance.
Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT
achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best
traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This
method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and
triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides
financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its
design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection
tasks.

*Jaris Küken,Lennart Purucker,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an early-stopping technique for tabular foundation models during in-context learning to accelerate inference while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference costs for tabular foundation models are prohibitively high, especially for larger datasets, despite their strong generalization capabilities without finetuning.

Method: The method dynamically evaluates whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder layer, followed by decoding embeddings using a pre-trained layer-wise decoder.

Result: Experiments show up to x1.3 acceleration on small classification tasks and up to x2.2 on larger tasks, with negligible predictive performance degradation.

Conclusion: Early stopping proves to be an effective and scalable technique to enhance the efficiency of tabular in-context learning models.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various
tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization
without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain
high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose
early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically
evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder
layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise
decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early
stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with
negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we
further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving
speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting
as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular
in-context learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational challenges in tokenizing and aggregating images in vision-based scientific foundation models.

Method: Proposed Distributed Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG), which works with various parallel strategies and vision transformers, optimizing for memory and efficiency.

Result: D-CHAG reduced memory usage by up to 75% and doubled throughput on tasks using up to 1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Conclusion: D-CHAG enhances the efficiency of scientific vision models, especially for high-channel datasets, contributing to advancements in scalable computing applications.

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for
advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their
ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical
groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal
correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and
aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by
current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed
Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets
with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is
compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer
architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated
D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated
with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75%
reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to
1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

TL;DR: This paper explores how multimodal machine learning can detect deception in Swedish dyadic interactions using audio-visual data and multimodal fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve deception detection by jointly analyzing behaviors of both deceivers and deceived individuals in emotionally charged interactions.

Method: Using a novel dataset, multimodal early and late fusion techniques utilizing audio (speech) and visual (facial action units and gaze) data were compared across different modalities and participants.

Result: Combining audio and visual data outperformed single-modality approaches, and incorporating both participants' data achieved the best detection accuracy (71%) through late fusion methods.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches and inclusion of dyadic data significantly enhance deception detection, supporting psychological theories and paving the way for future studies in related fields like psychotherapy.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of using multimodal machine learning
techniques to detect deception in dyadic interactions, focusing on the
integration of data from both the deceiver and the deceived. We compare early
and late fusion approaches, utilizing audio and video data - specifically,
Action Units and gaze information - across all possible combinations of
modalities and participants. Our dataset, newly collected from Swedish native
speakers engaged in truth or lie scenarios on emotionally relevant topics,
serves as the basis for our analysis. The results demonstrate that
incorporating both speech and facial information yields superior performance
compared to single-modality approaches. Moreover, including data from both
participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best
performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both
modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories
suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial
interactions. As the first study of its kind on a Scandinavian cohort, this
research lays the groundwork for future investigations into dyadic
interactions, particularly within psychotherapy settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an optimal control-inspired training for ResNets that penalizes intermediate outputs and enables theory-based layer pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a theory-based training method for ResNets that can improve efficiency by addressing unnecessary deeper layers.

Method: The method involves incorporating stage cost penalties on intermediate outputs of hidden states in ResNets, treating the training dynamic like an optimal control problem.

Result: The training strategy biases the weights of unnecessary deeper residual layers to vanish, suggesting a potential for systematic layer pruning.

Conclusion: Optimal control principles can inform ResNet training, leading to more efficient architectures through layer pruning grounded in a theoretical framework.

Abstract: We propose a training formulation for ResNets reflecting an optimal control
problem that is applicable for standard architectures and general loss
functions. We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs
of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For
standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state
through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate
that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual
layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer
pruning strategy.

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Reinforcement Learning approach to optimize low-storage Extended Stability Runge-Kutta methods, improving computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency in high-order, low-storage Extended Stability Runge-Kutta methods for large-scale scientific computations.

Method: A hybrid approach combining Genetic Algorithm-driven mutations for exploring the search space and Reinforcement Learning-based state transitions for refining heuristic selection dynamically.

Result: The proposed framework led to a 25% reduction in IPOPT runtime compared to traditional methods, maintaining numerical stability and accuracy, validated on benchmark problems like the Brusselator systems and Navier-Stokes equations.

Conclusion: Adaptive heuristic discovery via the GA-RL framework enhances resource efficiency in high-fidelity simulations, paving the way for more advanced methods using Deep RL and AutoML for heuristic optimization.

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving
large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including
weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling.
However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains
challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study
introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK
methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed
heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven
mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition
mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic
parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly
improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation
framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems,
including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes
equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT
runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining
numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of
adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity
simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in
real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other
demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic
optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration
using Deep RL and AutoML-based heuristic search

*Priyanka Avhad,Vedanti Kshirsagar,Urvi Ranjan,Mahek Nakhua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops machine learning models to predict individual susceptibility to cervical and breast cancer in Telangana, provides hospital recommendations based on location, and aims to spread awareness and reduce cancer mortality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The low rates of cancer screening and limited awareness of cervical and breast cancer symptoms and practices prompted the development of predictive tools and educational campaigns to improve cancer literacy and reduce mortality.

Method: The researchers employed machine learning techniques: decision tree classification for cervical cancer susceptibility and support vector classification for breast cancer susceptibility. They also integrated location-based hospital recommendations and health card systems for record maintenance.

Result: Machine learning models were successfully implemented for cancer susceptibility prediction, alongside a system to recommend nearby treatment facilities and promote awareness drives.

Conclusion: This solution contributes to reducing cancer mortality, increasing early detection, and promoting awareness among people in Telangana, taking a step forward toward addressing deficiencies in cancer literacy and healthcare access.

Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for
cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3
percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is
the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness
about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We
developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to
breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to
provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based
on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the
health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct
awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision
tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical
cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by
devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading
cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing
cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces an unsupervised fault diagnosis method for Cyber-Physical Systems using multivariate time-series analysis, process mining, and stochastic simulation to detect and understand anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of manual fault modeling in CPSs, which is complex, error-prone, and hard to interpret, by developing an efficient and interpretable fault diagnosis method.

Method: The proposed approach detects collective anomalies from multivariate time-series data, converts them into event logs, extracts interpretable process models using process mining, and incorporates stochastic simulation using timing distributions in Petri nets.

Result: The methodology was validated on the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), demonstrating effectiveness in modeling, simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors, which facilitated the creation of fault dictionaries.

Conclusion: The developed method enhances fault diagnosis in CPSs, advancing predictive maintenance and enabling digital twin development for industrial processes.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring
system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting
anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of
faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models
that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this
challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that
integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process
mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected
from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These
anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the
discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By
incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach
supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root
cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using
the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart
manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,
simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation
of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the
development of digital twins for industrial environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in MTS-AD such as inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and sparse anomaly labels by creating a unified benchmark for evaluating anomaly detection methods and model selection.

Method: mTSBench assesses 24 anomaly detection methods, including LLM-based detectors, using 344 labeled time series from 19 datasets across diverse domains, under standardized conditions.

Result: The evaluation confirms that no anomaly detection method performs best universally, emphasizing the importance and current limitations of model selection techniques.

Conclusion: mTSBench serves as a standardized framework for rigorous comparisons, aiming to advance adaptive anomaly detection and improve model selection methodologies.

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains
like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains
challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and
sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for
MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series
across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24
anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors
for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model
selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior
findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets,
underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art
selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench
provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible
comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and
robust model selection.

*Ziyue Li,Chenrui Fan,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates grokking (delayed generalization performance) in pretraining a large language model (OLMoE) and proposes metrics to monitor generalization without finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the phenomenon of grokking and its implications in large-scale language model pretraining, and provide practical tools to monitor generalization.

Method: The study analyzes grokking dynamics during the pretraining of a 7B parameter large language model, introducing pathway-based metrics for measuring pathway distance and complexity.

Result: Grokking is shown to occur asynchronously across different data types, with pathway structures evolving from random to structured. This evolution correlates with the shift from memorization to generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics predict generalization improvement effectively, offering practical and theoretical insights for optimizing pretraining processes in large foundation models.

Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss
converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the
mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning
mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or
highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of
grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language
model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate
generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code
generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the
pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter
grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of
generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find
that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve
from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples
during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the
converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,
providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we
develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a
single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement
on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely
dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,
enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and
test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model
complexity and improve the generalization bound.

*Marc Bara*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first theoretical framework for using spiking neural networks (SNNs) in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase unwrapping, aiming for energy-efficient and accurate processing in large-scale earth observation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the exponential growth of Earth observation data volumes, energy-efficient processing is critical for sustainability. Current methods for SAR phase unwrapping do not utilize SNNs, representing a missed opportunity for energy savings and computational efficiency.

Method: The authors designed spike encoding schemes tailored to wrapped phase data, proposed specialized SNN architectures exploiting the spatial propagation inherent in phase unwrapping, and conducted a theoretical analysis of computational complexity and convergence.

Result: The proposed SNN framework demonstrates how temporal dynamics in SNNs can naturally address spatial continuity constraints in phase unwrapping, showing promise in energy-efficient, large-scale InSAR processing.

Conclusion: This study establishes an unexplored intersection between neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, suggesting SNNs as a viable, energy-efficient alternative to conventional algorithms for large-scale applications.

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural
networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase
unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive
literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase
unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth
observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like
NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing
becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their
event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x
compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We
develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data,
propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase
unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and
convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics
inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints
fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at
the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a
complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more
sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The study introduces Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a novel framework leveraging human brain activity to train and improve artificial neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper was motivated by the realization that the human brain efficiently creates abstract representations with fewer data and lower computational demands compared to artificial models.

Method: Two strategies, Brain Contrastive Transfer and Brain Latent Transfer, were proposed to align neural activity with artificial networks and transfer features via supervised regression.

Result: The B2M framework was validated in two tasks—memory-based decision-making and autonomous driving—showing faster convergence and better predictive accuracy than isolated training methods.

Conclusion: Brain representations are promising for enhancing artificial neural networks, enabling efficient training of complex tasks that would otherwise require significant computational resources.

Abstract: Transfer learning enhances the training of novel sensory and decision models
by employing rich feature representations from large, pre-trained teacher
models. Cognitive neuroscience shows that the human brain creates
low-dimensional, abstract representations for efficient sensorimotor coding.
Importantly, the brain can learn these representations with significantly fewer
data points and less computational power than artificial models require. We
introduce Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a framework where neural
activity from human sensory and decision-making tasks acts as the teacher model
for training artificial neural networks. We propose two B2M strategies: (1)
Brain Contrastive Transfer, which aligns brain activity and network activations
through a contrastive objective; and (2) Brain Latent Transfer, which projects
latent dynamics from similar cognitive tasks onto student networks via
supervised regression of brain-derived features. We validate B2M in
memory-based decision-making with a recurrent neural network and scene
reconstruction for autonomous driving with a variational autoencoder. The
results show that student networks benefiting from brain-based transfer
converge faster and achieve higher predictive accuracy than networks trained in
isolation. Our findings indicate that the brain's representations are valuable
for artificial learners, paving the way for more efficient learning of complex
decision-making representations, which would be costly or slow through purely
artificial training.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that integrates quantum and neuromorphic computing for energy-efficient and scalable artificial intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing quantum spiking neuron models that rely on classical memory and backpropagation, impeding scalability and energy efficiency.

Method: The authors propose an SQS neuron based on multi-qubit quantum circuits to enable single-shot probabilistic spike generation with internal quantum memory. The training of SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) is achieved using a local learning rule tailored for quantum hardware.

Result: The proposed SQSNN model combines the time-series processing efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the large state space of quantum computing, achieving modularity, scalability, and compatibility with quantum hardware.

Conclusion: The integration of neuromorphic and quantum paradigms in the SQSNN model highlights its potential for scalable, energy-efficient, and hardware-optimized quantum spiking neural networks.

Abstract: Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising
paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary
strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing
time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation,
consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand,
leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are
exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these
paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models
have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron
implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring
repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use
conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we
propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these
challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a
spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic
spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS
neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a
hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global
classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series
efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state
space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks
that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.

Conclusion: The research provides a foundational automated framework for optimizing human-AI interaction and offers adaptable solutions for specific constraints, advancing beyond manual tuning methods.

Abstract: The concurrent optimization of language models and instructional prompts
presents a significant challenge for deploying efficient and effective AI
systems, particularly when balancing performance against computational costs
like token usage. This paper introduces and assesses a bi-objective
evolutionary search engine designed to navigate this complex space, focusing
specifically on Small Language Models (SLMs). We employ the NSGA-II algorithm
and prompt grammar to simultaneously optimize for task accuracy and token
efficiency across some reasoning tasks. Our results successfully identify
diverse, high-performing model-prompt combinations, quantitatively revealing
the critical trade-off between the two objectives. This research highlights
task-specific affinities between particular SLMs and prompt structures (e.g.,
instructions, context, chain of thought). The generated practical Pareto fronts
offer decision-makers a portfolio of optimized solutions adaptable to their
specific constraints. This automated approach moves beyond traditional manual
tuning, providing a foundational framework for discovering effective human-AI
interaction patterns.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework that reduces impact forces and improves robustness during robotic catching by optimizing pre- and post-catching phases via motion planning and control strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of high impact forces during robotic catching, which can lead to task failure, hardware damage, and challenges when handling objects with high mass-to-payload ratios.

Method: The authors propose a two-phase approach: (1) In the pre-catching phase, a real-time optimal motion planner minimizes velocity differences between the robot and the object. (2) In the post-catching phase, position, velocity, and stiffness are adapted based on human demonstrations to smoothly dissipate energy. A hierarchical quadratic programming controller maintains constraints and minimizes reflected mass at the end-effector.

Result: The experiments demonstrated that velocity matching significantly reduces excessive joint torques otherwise making the task infeasible. Reflected mass minimization and increased catching height were shown to improve robustness. Catching was also successfully extended to multiple Cartesian axes.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a generalizable, effective framework for reducing impact forces and improving hardware safety and task performance during robotic catching.

Abstract: Robotic catching of flying objects typically generates high impact forces
that might lead to task failure and potential hardware damages. This is
accentuated when the object mass to robot payload ratio increases, given the
strong inertial components characterizing this task. This paper aims to address
this problem by proposing an implicitly impact-aware framework that
accomplishes the catching task in both pre- and post-catching phases. In the
first phase, a motion planner generates optimal trajectories that minimize
catching forces, while in the second, the object's energy is dissipated
smoothly, minimizing bouncing. In particular, in the pre-catching phase, a
real-time optimal planner is responsible for generating trajectories of the
end-effector that minimize the velocity difference between the robot and the
object to reduce impact forces during catching. In the post-catching phase, the
robot's position, velocity, and stiffness trajectories are generated based on
human demonstrations when catching a series of free-falling objects with
unknown masses. A hierarchical quadratic programming-based controller is used
to enforce the robot's constraints (i.e., joint and torque limits) and create a
stack of tasks that minimizes the reflected mass at the end-effector as a
secondary objective. The initial experiments isolate the problem along one
dimension to accurately study the effects of each contribution on the metrics
proposed. We show how the same task, without velocity matching, would be
infeasible due to excessive joint torques resulting from the impact. The
addition of reflected mass minimization is then investigated, and the catching
height is increased to evaluate the method's robustness. Finally, the setup is
extended to catching along multiple Cartesian axes, to prove its generalization
in space.

### [263] [Model-Based Real-Time Pose and Sag Estimation of Overhead Power Lines Using LiDAR for Drone Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20812)
*Alexandre Girard,Steven A. Parkison,Philippe Hamelin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for drone-based localization of power line arrays using LiDAR, overcoming challenges like partial observations and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspection of energized power lines using drones is simplified yet challenging due to the minimal detectable surface of conductors, inconsistent detection, and difficulty in separating conductors from non-conductors in LiDAR scans.

Method: The approach minimizes errors by using a single geometric model for the conductor array instead of tracking individual conductors, ensuring efficient and accurate localization.

Result: The method delivers accurate tracking with convergence under 50 ms per frame and handles partial observations, noise, and high outlier ratios effectively, as shown through experimental data.

Conclusion: The proposed estimation approach is robust, fast, and capable of handling noisy or incomplete LiDAR data, making it practical for drone inspections of power lines.

Abstract: Drones can inspect overhead power lines while they remain energized,
significantly simplifying the inspection process. However, localizing a drone
relative to all conductors using an onboard LiDAR sensor presents several
challenges: (1) conductors provide minimal surface for LiDAR beams limiting the
number of conductor points in a scan, (2) not all conductors are consistently
detected, and (3) distinguishing LiDAR points corresponding to conductors from
other objects, such as trees and pylons, is difficult. This paper proposes an
estimation approach that minimizes the error between LiDAR measurements and a
single geometric model representing the entire conductor array, rather than
tracking individual conductors separately. Experimental results, using data
from a power line drone inspection, demonstrate that this method achieves
accurate tracking, with a solver converging under 50 ms per frame, even in the
presence of partial observations, noise, and outliers. A sensitivity analysis
shows that the estimation approach can tolerate up to twice as many outlier
points as valid conductors measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-quadrotor systems for tracking moving targets in scenarios with visual occlusion and without reliance on external localization systems.

Method: The paper utilizes heterogeneous perception strategies, modified Kalman filters, and event-triggered distributed Kalman filters for estimation and fuses them with an oscillator-based cooperative circumnavigation controller.

Result: The framework successfully tracks and encloses moving targets in occluded environments during both indoor/outdoor experiments, exhibiting fault tolerance in a quadrotor failure scenario.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates practicality and robustness, making it suitable for deployment in challenging environments like search-and-rescue operations.

Abstract: A cooperative circumnavigation framework is proposed for multi-quadrotor
systems to enclose and track a moving target without reliance on external
localization systems. The distinct relationships between quadrotor-quadrotor
and quadrotor-target interactions are evaluated using a heterogeneous
perception strategy and corresponding state estimation algorithms. A modified
Kalman filter is developed to fuse visual-inertial odometry with range
measurements to enhance the accuracy of inter-quadrotor relative localization.
An event-triggered distributed Kalman filter is designed to achieve robust
target state estimation under visual occlusion by incorporating neighbor
measurements and estimated inter-quadrotor relative positions. Using the
estimation results, a cooperative circumnavigation controller is constructed,
leveraging an oscillator-based autonomous formation flight strategy. We conduct
extensive indoor and outdoor experiments to validate the efficiency of the
proposed circumnavigation framework in occluded environments. Furthermore, a
quadrotor failure experiment highlights the inherent fault tolerance property
of the proposed framework, underscoring its potential for deployment in
search-and-rescue operations.

Conclusion: Post-training of VLA models is crucial for enhancing their performance in downstream applications, and the human motor learning analogy is a useful perspective for guiding research in this area.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models extend vision-language models (VLM) by
integrating action generation modules for robotic manipulation. Leveraging
strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models
exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However,
applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps
without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the
critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream
applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA
model post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's
ability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the
process of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews
post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor
learning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A
structured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1)
enhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3)
deepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key
challenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing
a conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a
comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human
motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using conditional diffusion models to synthetically generate thermal camera data from RGB images, aiming to address the lack of thermal datasets for autonomous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous systems face environmental limitations with sensors like cameras, LiDARs, and RADARs, especially in degraded conditions like nighttime or fog. Thermal cameras can identify heat signatures but lack sufficient data for integration into robotics.

Method: The authors use conditional diffusion models with self-attention mechanisms to synthesize thermal images from existing RGB datasets, leveraging learned thermal properties of objects.

Result: The proposed approach augments existing driving robotics datasets with synthetic thermal imagery, enhancing their utility in tasks like segmentation, detection, and depth estimation.

Conclusion: Synthetic thermal data generated by conditional diffusion models can help facilitate the adoption of thermal cameras in autonomous systems, addressing the current data scarcity.

Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on sensors to estimate the environment around them.
However, cameras, LiDARs, and RADARs have their own limitations. In nighttime
or degraded environments such as fog, mist, or dust, thermal cameras can
provide valuable information regarding the presence of objects of interest due
to their heat signature. They make it easy to identify humans and vehicles that
are usually at higher temperatures compared to their surroundings. In this
paper, we focus on the adaptation of thermal cameras for robotics and
automation, where the biggest hurdle is the lack of data. Several multi-modal
datasets are available for driving robotics research in tasks such as scene
segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation, which are the cornerstone
of autonomous systems. However, they are found to be lacking in thermal
imagery. Our paper proposes a solution to augment these datasets with synthetic
thermal data to enable widespread and rapid adaptation of thermal cameras. We
explore the use of conditional diffusion models to convert existing RGB images
to thermal images using self-attention to learn the thermal properties of
real-world objects.

*Zhou Tianxing,Wang Zhirui,Ao Haojia,Chen Guangyan,Xing Boyang,Cheng Jingwen,Yang Yi,Yue Yufeng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the STEP framework for reliable long-horizon task planning in robots by using a tree-based hierarchical structure for subgoals, achieving higher task success rates in both simulated and real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Language Models struggle with reasoning for long-horizon tasks, limiting their effectiveness in real-world robots. The motivation is to enhance these capabilities to improve task success rates.

Method: STEP uses a hierarchical subgoal tree with the help of two closed-loop models: a subgoal decomposition model (leveraging LLMs to break down goals into subgoals) and a leaf node termination model (providing real-time feedback to terminate tasks or move to actions).

Result: STEP outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving success rates of 34% in the VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and 25% on real robots for long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: The STEP framework is effective for enhancing long-horizon planning and task execution in robotics, proving the value of hierarchical structures and feedback mechanisms for real-world applications.

Abstract: The ability to perform reliable long-horizon task planning is crucial for
deploying robots in real-world environments. However, directly employing Large
Language Models (LLMs) as action sequence generators often results in low
success rates due to their limited reasoning ability for long-horizon embodied
tasks. In the STEP framework, we construct a subgoal tree through a pair of
closed-loop models: a subgoal decomposition model and a leaf node termination
model. Within this framework, we develop a hierarchical tree structure that
spans from coarse to fine resolutions. The subgoal decomposition model
leverages a foundation LLM to break down complex goals into manageable
subgoals, thereby spanning the subgoal tree. The leaf node termination model
provides real-time feedback based on environmental states, determining when to
terminate the tree spanning and ensuring each leaf node can be directly
converted into a primitive action. Experiments conducted in both the
VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and on real robots demonstrate that STEP achieves
long-horizon embodied task completion with success rates up to 34% (WAH-NL) and
25% (real robot) outperforming SOTA methods.

Result: V2X-REALM significantly outperformed existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy.

Conclusion: V2X-REALM enhances the scalability and robustness of cooperative autonomous driving in complex and degraded environments.

Abstract: Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and
visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for
autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in
cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and
reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose
V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive
multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail
scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven
long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation
models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across
vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity
efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that
modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or
corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning
objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario
feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM
significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning,
safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions,
advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.

Conclusion: The study showcases a pioneering knowledge-driven approach for data-efficient robotic learning, improving manipulation reliability in diverse and real-world settings.

Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm in robot manipulation,

propose knowledge-driven imitation learning, a framework that leverages
external structural semantic knowledge to abstract object representations

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D LiDAR SLAM systems rely on point clouds, requiring significant storage and lacking compactness and global consistency. There's a need for a more efficient, scalable mapping solution.

Method: The authors leverage CURL's implicit spherical harmonics encoding to enable compact maps and continuous reconstruction with optimized LiDAR pose estimation and local Bundle Adjustment for pose refinement and map correction.

Result: CURL-SLAM demonstrated state-of-the-art 3D mapping quality, competitive trajectory accuracy, and real-time performance (10 Hz) on a CPU.

Conclusion: CURL-SLAM provides an efficient and consistent solution for large-scale 3D mapping with real-time processing capabilities. Its implementation will be made available to the community.

Abstract: This paper studies 3D LiDAR mapping with a focus on developing an updatable
and localizable map representation that enables continuity, compactness and
consistency in 3D maps. Traditional LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) systems often rely on 3D point cloud maps, which typically require
extensive storage to preserve structural details in large-scale environments.
In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for LiDAR SLAM by leveraging the
Continuous and Ultra-compact Representation of LiDAR (CURL) introduced in [1].
Our proposed LiDAR mapping approach, CURL-SLAM, produces compact 3D maps
capable of continuous reconstruction at variable densities using CURL's
spherical harmonics implicit encoding, and achieves global map consistency
after loop closure. Unlike popular Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based LiDAR
odometry techniques, CURL-SLAM formulates LiDAR pose estimation as a unique
optimization problem tailored for CURL and extends it to local Bundle
Adjustment (BA), enabling simultaneous pose refinement and map correction.
Experimental results demonstrate that CURL-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art 3D
mapping quality and competitive LiDAR trajectory accuracy, delivering
sensor-rate real-time performance (10 Hz) on a CPU. We will release the
CURL-SLAM implementation to the community.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRA-MPPI, a motion planner for mobile robots that considers uncertain trajectories of human obstacles using non-Gaussian predictions and Monte Carlo methods, offering enhanced safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenges mobile robots face in safely navigating among humans, particularly handling uncertainty in predicting dynamic obstacle trajectories.

Method: The DRA-MPPI planner employs Monte Carlo techniques to calculate joint Collision Probability (CP) for trajectories sampled in real-time, rejecting those above a CP threshold or integrating CP into the navigation cost.

Result: DRA-MPPI showed improved safety and planning efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as S-MPC, Frenet planner, and vanilla MPPI in both real-world and simulated experiments.

Conclusion: DRA-MPPI integrates dynamic obstacle prediction with motion planning to ensure safety and mitigate common issues, like freezing robot behavior during navigation.

Abstract: Deploying mobile robots safely among humans requires the motion planner to
account for the uncertainty in the other agents' predicted trajectories. This
remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily
shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI),
a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with
potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's
gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the
joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several
hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This
enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the
integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function.
Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing
safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles
demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet
planner, and vanilla MPPI.

harnessing language to craft structured scene descriptors, providing a uniform
interface for both spatial understanding and task performance through flexible
language instructions. Moreover, we introduce a novel action consistency
constraint that aligns visual perception with corresponding actions, thereby
enhancing the learning of actionable visual representations. Additionally, we
have reformulated the Markov decision process for manipulation tasks into a

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: USVs struggle with maintaining precision in adverse environmental conditions like waves and currents, demanding robust control solutions.

Method: Implemented ADRC-based trajectory tracking controller, tested via simulations with realistic environmental disturbances and field trials in a harbour and at sea.

Result: ADRC reduces trajectory cross-track errors compared to PID in simulations and field tests but incurs higher energy and control effort consumption.

Conclusion: ADRC provides more accurate trajectory tracking for USVs under varying disturbances, but energy efficiency considerations remain crucial.

Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) face significant control challenges due to
uncertain environmental disturbances like waves and currents. This paper
proposes a trajectory tracking controller based on Active Disturbance Rejection
Control (ADRC) implemented on the DUS V2500. A custom simulation incorporating
realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the
controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests
in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results
demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested
conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort
and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a
further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the

Result: The proposed methodology demonstrated effective real-time roughness characterization and improved operational safety on stochastic rough surfaces during experimental validation.

Conclusion: The innovative Bayesian framework significantly reduces operational risks and enhances safety margins for autonomous vehicles when navigating varying terrain.

Abstract: This research addresses critical autonomous vehicle control challenges
arising from road roughness variation, which induces course deviations and
potential loss of road contact during steering operations. We present a novel
real-time road roughness estimation system employing Bayesian calibration
methodology that processes axle accelerations to predict terrain roughness with
quantifiable confidence measures. The technical framework integrates a Gaussian
process surrogate model with a simulated half-vehicle model, systematically
processing vehicle velocity and road surface roughness parameters to generate
corresponding axle acceleration responses. The Bayesian calibration routine
performs inverse estimation of road roughness from observed accelerations and
velocities, yielding posterior distributions that quantify prediction
uncertainty for adaptive risk management. Training data generation utilizes
Latin Hypercube sampling across comprehensive velocity and roughness parameter
spaces, while the calibrated model integrates seamlessly with a Simplex
controller architecture to dynamically adjust velocity limits based on
real-time roughness predictions. Experimental validation on stochastically
generated surfaces featuring varying roughness regions demonstrates robust
real-time characterization capabilities, with the integrated Simplex control
strategy effectively enhancing autonomous vehicle operational safety through
proactive surface condition response. This innovative Bayesian framework
establishes a comprehensive foundation for mitigating roughness-related

*Jun Cen,Chaohui Yu,Hangjie Yuan,Yuming Jiang,Siteng Huang,Jiayan Guo,Xin Li,Yibing Song,Hao Luo,Fan Wang,Deli Zhao,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: WorldVLA combines visual understanding and action modeling within a single framework to improve predictive and generative abilities. It shows mutual improvements between models and addresses autoregressive sequence errors with an attention mask strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to unify action and image understanding with generation capabilities to improve predictive modeling in dynamic environments.

Method: WorldVLA integrates a Vision-Language-Action model with a world model. It leverages action and image understanding for better physics-based predictions and introduces an attention mask strategy to mitigate autoregressive prediction errors.

Result: WorldVLA outperforms standalone models in prediction and action generation tasks, showcasing mutual improvement between components. The attention mask strategy enhances autoregressive action generation.

Conclusion: WorldVLA effectively unifies action and image modeling, addressing limitations in autoregressive prediction, and sets a benchmark for integrated generative frameworks.

Abstract: We present WorldVLA, an autoregressive action world model that unifies action
and image understanding and generation. Our WorldVLA intergrates
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The
world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image
understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the
environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates
the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual
understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We
demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models,
highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action
model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model
deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner.
This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization
capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from
earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an
attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the
generation of the current action, which shows significant performance
improvement in the action chunk generation task.

### [281] [Generating Reliable Adverse event Profiles for Health through Automated Integrated Data (GRAPH-AID): A Semi-Automated Ontology Building Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20851)
*Srikar Reddy Gadusu,Larry Callahan,Samir Lababidi,Arunasri Nishtala,Sophia Healey,Hande McGinty*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a Python-based approach to streamline ontology generation by integrating Neo4j databases with OWL, focusing on FDA adverse drug event data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of data and frequent changes highlight challenges in knowledge graph creation, particularly in linking Neo4j databases with OWL without requiring DL syntax expertise.

Method: A Python script leveraging the rdflib library was created to automate ontology class and axiom generation using FDA's FAERS dataset.

Result: The Python-based method successfully facilitated the integration of Neo4j data into ontology structures, making the process more accessible for users unfamiliar with DL.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies ontology generation, aids drug safety monitoring, and addresses public health challenges arising from expanding datasets.

Abstract: As data and knowledge expand rapidly, adopting systematic methodologies for
ontology generation has become crucial. With the daily increases in data
volumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and
retrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become
increasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and
Representation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address
these challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this
methodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j
databases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate
data from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches
often require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not
be familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to
bridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes
Python and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our
novel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
database. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically
generates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother
integration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the
challenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse
drug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public
health decision-making.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study develops and evaluates five domain-specific RAG systems for real-world applications, documenting user feedback and lessons learned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of empirical studies on real-world RAG implementations, including their technical challenges, user involvement, and practical lessons documented systematically.

Method: Developed RAG systems integrating multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval, and domain-specific LLMs for various domains. A web-based evaluation involving 100 participants gauged the systems on six dimensions.

Result: The evaluation outlined user feedback on usability, relevance, accuracy, and other factors, leading to the documentation of 12 key lessons around challenges in implementing RAG systems.

Conclusion: RAG systems hold promise in addressing practical problems across domains, but their deployment requires addressing technical, operational, and ethical challenges to enhance reliability and usability.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach
for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing
limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a
lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based
implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general
user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons
learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed
for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture,
industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates
multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted
LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs.
A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the
systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii)
Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of
Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we
documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and
ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in
practice.

### [283] [Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20883)
*Kyanna Dagenais,Istvan David*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates human guidance to develop complex model transformation (MT) sequences, improving RL performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of complex model transformations for tasks like model synchronization, automated repair, and exploration is error-prone and infeasible manually. RL offers a way to automate this process but often struggles with performance in complex scenarios.

Method: A new RL-based framework combines human guidance—despite its inherent uncertainties—with RL primitives for developing optimal MT sequences. RL programs are created based on user-defined MTs to efficiently explore solutions.

Result: The use of human guidance in RL significantly improves performance and accelerates the development of complex model transformations, showing a balance between the utility of human advice and its certainty.

Conclusion: Incorporating even uncertain human guidance into an RL framework enhances its capability to address complex engineering workflow challenges, moving closer to effective human-in-the-loop systems.

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations
(MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of
such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design
space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often
infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate
these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial
and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL
methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,
human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach
and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided
by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to
be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal
MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,
substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient
development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and
timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven
human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

### [284] [Boosting Vulnerability Detection with Inter-function Multilateral Association Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21014)
*Shaojian Qiu,Mengyang Huang,Jiahao Cheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces IFMA-VD, a framework for vulnerability detection emphasizing multilateral inter-function relationships using hypergraph analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vulnerability detection methods often overlook complex inter-function relationships, leading to incomplete detection results.

Method: The IFMA-VD framework uses hypergraph convolution to analyze multilateral associations by constructing code behavior hypergraphs from program dependency graphs and hyperedges.

Result: IFMA-VD demonstrated better F-measure and Recall on widely-used datasets, showing enhanced vulnerability detection and improved code feature representation.

Conclusion: IFMA-VD provides a novel and effective approach to improve vulnerability detection by leveraging multilateral association features in code analysis.

Abstract: Vulnerability detection is a crucial yet challenging technique for ensuring
the security of software systems. Currently, most deep learning-based
vulnerability detection methods focus on stand-alone functions, neglecting the
complex inter-function interrelations, particularly the multilateral
associations. This oversight can fail to detect vulnerabilities in these
interrelations. To address this gap, we present an Inter-Function Multilateral
Association analysis framework for Vulnerability Detection (IFMA-VD). The
cornerstone of the IFMA-VD lies in constructing a code behavior hypergraph and
utilizing hyperedge convolution to extract multilateral association features.
Specifically, we first parse functions into a code property graph to generate
intra-function features. Following this, we construct a code behavior
hypergraph by segmenting the program dependency graph to isolate and encode
behavioral features into hyperedges. Finally, we utilize a hypergraph network
to capture the multilateral association knowledge for augmenting vulnerability
detection. We evaluate IFMA-VD on three widely used vulnerability datasets and
demonstrate improvements in F-measure and Recall compared to baseline methods.
Additionally, we illustrate that multilateral association features can boost
code feature representation and validate the effectiveness of IFMA-VD on
real-world datasets.

*Abdelkarim El-Hajjami,Camille Salinesi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Synthline v1, a method to generate synthetic requirements data for AI in Requirements Engineering, achieving human-level or better performance in certain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scarcity of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets that hinder advancements in Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering (AI4RE).

Method: Synthline v1 employs advanced generation strategies, prompt optimization using techniques like PACE, and post-generation curation to systematically control the quality of synthetic requirements data.

Result: The method achieved significant F1-score improvements in classification tasks, with synthetic data for security and defect classification surpassing human-authored datasets by +7.8 and +15.4 points, respectively.

Conclusion: Systematic approaches, such as Synthline v1, can effectively generate high-quality synthetic requirements, offering a practical means to overcome dataset scarcity and contribute to AI4RE advancement.

Abstract: The shortage of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets remains a
major barrier to advancing Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering
(AI4RE). While Large Language Models offer promising capabilities for synthetic
data generation, systematic approaches to control and optimize the quality of
generated requirements remain underexplored. This paper presents Synthline v1,
an enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data
that extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and
curation techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how
prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation
curation affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect
detection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security
vs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting
significantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,
with F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic
Editing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,
greatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing
performance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves
diversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some
redundancy may help ML models. Most importantly, our results show that
synthetic requirements can match or outperform human-authored ones for specific
tasks, with synthetic data surpassing human data for security (+7.8 points) and
defect classification (+15.4 points). These findings offer practical insights
for AI4RE and chart a viable path to mitigating dataset scarcity through
systematic synthetic generation.

TL;DR: This paper proposes $T^3$, an innovative framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs), Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, and tree search to enhance Automatic Program Repair (APR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficiency of Chain-of-Thought techniques in APR tasks due to the complex logic and multi-step reasoning required.

Method: The study evaluates common CoT techniques in APR and integrates the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with tree search in the $T^3$ framework.

Result: $T^3$ improves the precision of generating candidate repair solutions and provides better strategies for sample selection and repair in APR.

Conclusion: By combining CoT, LLMs, and tree search, $T^3$ offers a robust and efficient framework for automated debugging in software development.

Abstract: Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development
and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human
intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the
complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT
techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and
proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning
capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of
generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable
guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks,
establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.

*Daniil Karol,Elizaveta Artser,Ilya Vlasov,Yaroslav Golubev,Hieke Keuning,Anastasiia Birillo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: KOALA is a data collection tool for programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs, offering high configurability and collecting granular code snapshots and IDE events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for collecting data from students solving programming tasks lack configurability and fail to capture specific IDE events or fine-grained data.

Method: The authors developed KOALA, a plugin for JetBrains IDEs, to collect detailed data such as code snapshots, IDE actions, and other metrics like hotkey usage and file switching. The data is sent to a server and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format.

Result: KOALA was tested on 28 students in two courses, providing valuable insights into their coding behavior.

Conclusion: KOALA addresses the limitations of previous tools, offering a versatile solution for researchers and educators to study students' programming behavior.

Abstract: Collecting data of students solving programming tasks is incredibly valuable
for researchers and educators. It allows verifying that the students correctly
apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students'
misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g.,
no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the
specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to
configure.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly
configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students
solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in
IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or
disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During
problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured
granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data
not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between
files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where
it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To
showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two
courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.

*Ricardo Hideki Hangai Kojo,Luiz Fernando Corte Real,Renato Cordeiro Ferreira,Thatiane de Oliveira Rosa,Alfredo Goldman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the adoption of micro frontend architecture, analyzing its utility in an industry context through literature reviews and a case study in a marketplace company.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore when adopting micro frontend architecture is worthwhile, especially for resolving issues like technological deprecation and tight coupling in frontend and backend systems.

Method: Combined academic and gray literature reviews, implemented micro frontend architecture in a marketplace system, and evaluated its effectiveness using a semi-open questionnaire with developers.

Result: Micro frontend adoption resolved architectural challenges, leveraging existing infrastructure and knowledge but was ultimately not strictly necessary to fulfill the company's requirements.

Conclusion: The adoption was convenient and feasible due to existing infrastructure (microservices), but alternative architectures like monolithic frontends could have achieved comparable results.

Abstract: In the micro frontends architectural style, the frontend is divided into
smaller components, which can range from a simple button to an entire page. The
goal is to improve scalability, resilience, and team independence, albeit at
the cost of increased complexity and infrastructure demands. This paper seeks
to understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the
context of industry. To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the
state of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray
literature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for
handcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated
the implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At
the studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to
the tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated
frontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor
developer experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture
was adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and
technologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro
Frontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's
needs. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other
alternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable
results. What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the
company's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption,
which facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge
sharing between teams.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of integrating IoT data with traditional process data to enhance business process insights using process mining techniques. It presents a unified core data model to address fragmentation in existing data models and facilitate data sharing and collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face challenges in leveraging IoT data with traditional process data for process mining due to differences in data characteristics and fragmentation of data models.

Method: A core model synthesizing features of existing data models is proposed, based on common data integration requirements. A Python prototype is used for evaluation against use cases.

Result: The core model satisfies common requirements for data integration, demonstrated through implementation and evaluation in various scenarios.

Conclusion: The core model facilitates data sharing and collaboration in process mining, helping to overcome the challenges posed by fragmented data models.

Abstract: Advances in Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies have prompted the
integration of IoT devices with business processes (BPs) in many organizations
across various sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare and smart spaces. The
proliferation of IoT devices leads to the generation of large amounts of IoT
data providing a window on the physical context of BPs, which facilitates the
discovery of new insights about BPs using process mining (PM) techniques.
However, to achieve these benefits, IoT data need to be combined with
traditional process (event) data, which is challenging due to the very
different characteristics of IoT and process data, for instance in terms of
granularity levels. Recently, several data models were proposed to integrate
IoT data with process data, each focusing on different aspects of data
integration based on different assumptions and requirements. This fragmentation
hampers data exchange and collaboration in the field of PM, e.g., making it
tedious for researchers to share data. In this paper, we present a core model
synthesizing the most important features of existing data models. As the core
model is based on common requirements, it greatly facilitates data sharing and
collaboration in the field. A prototypical Python implementation is used to
evaluate the model against various use cases and demonstrate that it satisfies
these common requirements.

### [290] [Predicting Readiness to Engage in Psychotherapy of People with Chronic Pain Based on their Pain-Related Narratives Saar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20805)
*Saar Draznin Shiran,Boris Boltyansky,Alexandra Zhuravleva,Dmitry Scherbakov,Pavel Goldstein*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study uses NLP to gauge chronic-pain sufferers' readiness for psychotherapy by analyzing their narrated pain stories, demonstrating the potential for tailored interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronic pain affects 20% of the global population, with limited uptake of psychosocial care despite the biopsychosocial model's recognition of pain's multifaceted nature. This paper addresses the gap in linking patient narratives to treatment readiness.

Method: Twenty-four chronic-pain patients narrated stories about their pain experiences. These narratives were processed using a pretrained language model and machine-learning classifiers to determine readiness for therapy based on specific predictors.

Result: The perception-domain model achieved 95.7% accuracy in predicting readiness (AUC = 0.90), while the factors-influencing-pain model attained 83.3% accuracy (AUC = 0.75). Narrative length positively correlated with readiness in both domains.

Conclusion: NLP analysis of chronic-pain patients' narratives offers valuable signals of therapy readiness, making it a promising tool for initiating personalized biopsychosocial interventions more efficiently.

Abstract: Background. Chronic pain afflicts 20 % of the global population. A strictly
biomedical mind-set leaves many sufferers chasing somatic cures and has fuelled
the opioid crisis. The biopsychosocial model recognises pain subjective,
multifactorial nature, yet uptake of psychosocial care remains low. We
hypothesised that patients own pain narratives would predict their readiness to
engage in psychotherapy.
  Methods. In a cross-sectional pilot, 24 chronic-pain patients recorded
narrated pain stories on Painstory.science. Open questions probed perceived
pain source, interference and influencing factors. Narratives were cleaned,
embedded with a pretrained large-language model and entered into
machine-learning classifiers that output ready/not ready probabilities.
  Results. The perception-domain model achieved 95.7 % accuracy (specificity =
0.80, sensitivity = 1.00, AUC = 0.90). The factors-influencing-pain model
yielded 83.3 % accuracy (specificity = 0.60, sensitivity = 0.90, AUC = 0.75).
Sentence count correlated with readiness for perception narratives (r = 0.54, p
< .01) and factor narratives (r = 0.24, p < .05).
  Conclusion. Brief spoken pain narratives carry reliable signals of
willingness to start psychosocial treatment. NLP-based screening could help
clinicians match chronic-pain patients to appropriate interventions sooner,
supporting a patient-centred biopsychosocial pathway.

*Zhiyi Chen,Zhilin Ren,Wei Li,ZhenZhen Huo,ZhuangZheng Wang,Ye Liu,Bowen Hu,Wanting Chen,Ting Xu,Artemiy Leonov,Chenyan Zhang,Bernhard Hommel,Tingyong Feng*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study demonstrated that stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) effectively reduced procrastination, with lasting effects seen even after 6 months, by amplifying future reward valuation rather than mitigating task aversiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Procrastination, often linked to self-control failure, negatively impacts individual health and societal productivity. Current neurocognitive models remain unvalidated in real-world contexts and lack effective application in interventions.

Method: Researchers conducted a preregistered, double-blind, randomized controlled trial using high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) applied to the left DLPFC over seven sessions. They assessed effects using the intensive experience sampling method (iESM) at short-term and six-month intervals.

Result: HD-tDCS led to a durable reduction in real-world procrastination, persisting up to a six-month follow-up. The intervention specifically increased the valuation of future rewards, which mediated the behavioral improvement.

Conclusion: Stimulating the DLPFC addresses procrastination by enhancing reward valuation rather than reducing task aversiveness. This provides a theory-driven intervention strategy and underscores a value-based neurocognitive mechanism for improving self-control.

Abstract: Procrastination represents one of the most prevalent behavioral problems
affecting individual health and societal productivity. Although it is often
conceptualized as a form of self-control failure, its underlying neurocognitive
mechanisms are poorly understood. A leading model posits that procrastination
arises from imbalanced competing motivations: the avoidance of negative task
aversiveness and the pursuit of positive task outcomes, yet this theoretical
framework has not fully validated in real-world settings and not applied
effectively to guide interventions. Here, we addressed this gap with a
preregistered, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We applied seven
sessions of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS)
to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region for
self-control, in chronic procrastinators. Using the intensive experience
sampling method (iESM), we assessed the effect of anodal HD-tDCS on real-world
procrastination behavior at offline after-effect (2-day interval) and long-term
retention (6-month follow-up). We found that this neuromodulation produced a
lasting reduction in real-world procrastination, with effects sustained at a
6-month follow-up. While the intervention both decreased task aversiveness and
increased perceived task outcome value, causal mediation analysis revealed a
striking mechanism: the increase in task outcome value uniquely and
sufficiently mediated the entire behavioral improvement. In conclusion, these
findings provide causal evidence that enhancing DLPFC function mitigates
procrastination by selectively amplifying the valuation of future rewards, not
by simply reducing negative feelings about the task. This establishes a
precise, value-driven neurocognitive pathway for self-control and offers a
validated, theory-driven strategy for intervention.

*Nina Baldy,Marmaduke M Woodman,Viktor K Jirsa*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'anonymized personalization' for creating personalized virtual brain models without compromising privacy or requiring heavy computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable the use of personal neuroimaging data in virtual brain modeling while addressing concerns around privacy and computational demands.

Method: Amortized inference is combined with expanded model priors that allow for anonymous training and personalized inference, ensuring efficiency and privacy.

Result: Demonstration of the approach's reliability with an example and its implications for neuroscience.

Conclusion: The technique facilitates lightweight, personalized brain modeling in a secure and efficient manner, impacting experimental and computational neuroscience.

Abstract: Virtual brain twins are personalized digital models of individual human
subject or patient's brains, allowing for mechanistic interpretation of
neuroimaging data features. Training and inference with these models however
presents a pair of challenges: large shared infrastructure do not allow for use
of personal data and inference in clinical applications should not require
significant resources. We introduce "anonymized personalization" to address
both by expanding model priors to include personalization which under amortized
inference allows training to be performed anonymously, while inference is both
personalized and lightweight. We illustrate the basic approach, demonstrate
reliability in an example, and discuss the impact on both experimental and
computational neuroscience. Code is available at

*Abdi Reza,Takufumi Yanagisawa,Naoki Tani,Ryohei Fukuma,Takuto Emura,Satoru Oshino,Ben Seymour,Haruhiko Kishima*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study examines pain fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, focusing on the role of subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity using machine learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand STN biomarkers for pain fluctuations in PD and the relationship between bilateral STN activities and pain occurrence.

Method: An observational, data-driven approach was used, combining annotated pain data, binary pain ratings, STN signals, and explainable machine learning algorithms for pain level prediction.

Result: The study found that STN activity from both sides influences pain prediction, with specific frequency bands (gamma, beta, delta, theta) playing prominent roles.

Conclusion: Bilateral STN biomarkers significantly contribute to understanding endogenous pain fluctuations in Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Parkinson disease (PD) patients experience pain fluctuations that
significantly reduce their quality of life. Despite the vast knowledge of the
subthalamic nucleus (STN) role in PD, the STN biomarkers for pain fluctuations
and the relationship between bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) activities and
pain occurrence are still less understood. This observational study used
data-driven methods by collecting annotated pain followed by a series of
corresponding binary pain ratings and wirelessly transmitted STN signals, then
leveraging the explainable machine learning algorithm to predict binary pain
levels and sort the feature influence. The binary pain levels could be
predicted among annotated pain reports corresponding to PD-related pain
characteristics. The STN activity from both sides could impact pain prediction,
with gamma and beta bands in the contralateral STN and delta and theta bands in
the ipsilateral STN showing a prominent role. This study emphasizes the role of
bilateral STN biomarkers on endogenous pain fluctuations.

### [294] [The assumptions that restrain us from understanding consciousness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21485)
*Jaan Aru*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper challenges some of the key assumptions in the science of consciousness, including ideas about neural correlates, computational complexity, and theoretical approaches, while calling for a fresh perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the possibility that the science of consciousness, despite its progress, has unanswered questions due to reliance on traditional theories and assumptions.

Method: The author critiques foundational assumptions, including the idea of neural correlates at the level of spiking responses, the computational simplicity of consciousness, and the abstract view of consciousness computations, while proposing attention to internal consciousness changes like aha-moments.

Result: The paper identifies the need for reevaluating assumptions in neuroscience, computational theories, and the methodologies used in the study of consciousness.

Conclusion: The science of consciousness must critically revise its fundamental theoretical commitments and adopt new perspectives to break through existing limitations.

Abstract: The science of consciousness has been successful over the last decades. Yet,
it seems that some of the key questions remain unanswered. Perhaps, as a
science of consciousness, we cannot move forward using the same theoretical
commitments that brought us here. It might be necessary to revise some
assumptions we have made along the way. In this piece, I offer no answers, but
I will question some of these fundamental assumptions. We will try to take a
fresh look at the classical question about the neural and explanatory
correlates of consciousness. A key assumption is that neural correlates are to
be found at the level of spiking responses. However, perhaps we should not
simply take it for granted that this assumption holds true. Another common
assumption is that we are close to understanding the computations underlying
consciousness. I will try to show that computations related to consciousness
might be far more complex than our current theories envision. There is little
reason to think that consciousness is an abstract computation, as traditionally
believed. Furthermore, I will try to demonstrate that consciousness research
could benefit from investigating internal changes of consciousness, such as
aha-moments. Finally, I will ask which theories the science of consciousness
really needs.

*Matjaž Omladič,Martin Vuk,Aljaž Zalar*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper resolves an open problem about the mass distribution in quasi-copulas using an analytical approach, improving previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of statistical interpretation for quasi-copulas and solve an open problem raised in prior work.

Method: An analytical approach is employed to provide conclusive results for the mass distribution of multivariate quasi-copulas.

Result: A complete and definitive solution to the open problem about quasi-copulas is presented, surpassing prior computational methods.

Conclusion: The findings deliver an analytical resolution to a key question on quasi-copulas, contributing to the theoretical understanding in the dependence modeling field.

Abstract: A recent survey, nicknamed "Hitchhiker's Guide", J.J. Arias-Garc{\i}a, R.
Mesiar, and B. De Baets, A hitchhiker's guide to quasi-copulas, Fuzzy Sets and
Systems 393 (2020) 1-28, has raised the rating of quasi-copula problems in the
dependence modeling community in spite of the lack of statistical
interpretation of quasi-copulas. In our previous work (arXiv:2410.19339,
accepted in Fuzzy Sets and Systems), we addressed the question of extreme
values of the mass distribution associated with multivariate quasi-copulas.
Using a linear programming approach, we were able to solve Open Problem 5 of
the "Guide" up to dimension d = 17 and disprove a recent conjecture on the
solution to that problem. In this paper, we use an analytical approach to
provide a complete answer to the original question.

### [296] [Stable Minima of ReLU Neural Networks Suffer from the Curse of Dimensionality: The Neural Shattering Phenomenon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20779)
*Tongtong Liang,Dan Qiao,Yu-Xiang Wang,Rahul Parhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper investigates why flat solutions in training two-layer overparameterized ReLU networks with multivariate inputs fail to generalize in high dimensions, providing theoretical results and simulations to support the findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the implicit bias of flatness (low-loss curvature) in machine learning models and its effect on generalization, particularly in multivariate inputs, addressing gaps in existing research.

Method: The study analyzes two specific settings (generalization gap for flat solutions and MSE in nonparametric function estimation), provides theoretical upper and lower bounds, and develops a packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons.

Result: The results show that flat solutions, while they imply generalization, deteriorate exponentially in performance with increasing input dimensions, significantly underperforming low-norm solutions.

Conclusion: The research concludes that flat minima are fundamentally limited in high-dimensional settings due to phenomena like 'neural shattering,' which undermines their generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flatness / low (loss) curvature and its effects
on generalization in two-layer overparameterized ReLU networks with
multivariate inputs -- a problem well motivated by the minima stability and
edge-of-stability phenomena in gradient-descent training. Existing work either
requires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper
presents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate
inputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and
(2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable
minima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness
does imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily
deteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an
exponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\`a-vis low-norm
solutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a
novel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat
solutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely
activate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in
high dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive
numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the
first systematic explanation for why flat minima may fail to generalize in high
dimensions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve accuracy in supervised learning with challenging data distributions in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: Simultaneously optimize a neural network for dimensionality reduction and a Gaussian process regressor in latent space, while supervised by active learning minimization criteria.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms random sequential learning in experiments on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently handles complex functions, maintaining computational efficiency and practical applicability, extending potential for future scalability and uncertainty-aware learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces an active learning framework for manifold Gaussian
Process (GP) regression, combining manifold learning with strategic data
selection to improve accuracy in high-dimensional spaces. Our method jointly
optimizes a neural network for dimensionality reduction and a Gaussian process
regressor in the latent space, supervised by an active learning criterion that
minimizes global prediction error. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate
superior performance over randomly sequential learning. The framework
efficiently handles complex, discontinuous functions while preserving

### [298] [Lower Bounds on the Size of Markov Equivalence Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20933)
*Erik Jahn,Frederick Eberhardt,Leonard J. Schulman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates how relaxing assumptions like acyclicity and causal sufficiency increases the size of Markov equivalence classes in causal discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the impact of relaxing standard assumptions (acyclicity, causal sufficiency, uniform model prior) on the sizes of Markov equivalence classes in causal discovery.

Method: The study theoretically derived and analyzed lower bounds for the expected sizes of Markov equivalence classes under three different graph structures: sparse random directed acyclic graphs, uniformly random acyclic directed mixed graphs, and uniformly random directed cyclic graphs.

Result: It was proven that relaxing any of the assumptions led to exponentially larger lower bounds for the expected size of Markov equivalence classes across the three graph settings.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that the standard assumptions are crucial for keeping Markov equivalence classes small, and relaxing these assumptions profoundly increases their complexity, limiting observational data's power in causal discovery.

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms typically recover causal graphs only up to their
Markov equivalence classes unless additional parametric assumptions are made.
The sizes of these equivalence classes reflect the limits of what can be
learned about the underlying causal graph from purely observational data. Under
the assumptions of acyclicity, causal sufficiency, and a uniform model prior,
Markov equivalence classes are known to be small on average. In this paper, we
show that this is no longer the case when any of these assumptions is relaxed.
Specifically, we prove exponentially large lower bounds for the expected size
of Markov equivalence classes in three settings: sparse random directed acyclic
graphs, uniformly random acyclic directed mixed graphs, and uniformly random
directed cyclic graphs.

### [299] [Forecasting Geopolitical Events with a Sparse Temporal Fusion Transformer and Gaussian Process Hybrid: A Case Study in Middle Eastern and U.S. Conflict Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20935)
*Hsin-Hsiung Huang,Hayden Hampton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents STFT-VNNGP, a hybrid model designed to forecast geopolitical conflicts using sparse and bursty data. It integrates Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP) for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of standard deep learning models like TFT in forecasting sparse and overdispersed geopolitical data, which is crucial for national security.

Method: The method involves a two-stage hybrid architecture where TFT generates multi-quantile forecasts, and VNNGP applies spatiotemporal smoothing and quantifies uncertainties.

Result: STFT-VNNGP consistently outperforms standalone TFT in predicting conflict dynamics in the Middle East and U.S., especially for long-range, bursty events.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a robust and publicly reproducible framework for improving conflict prediction, thus offering more reliable and actionable intelligence from challenging datasets.

Abstract: Forecasting geopolitical conflict from data sources like the Global Database
of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) is a critical challenge for national
security. The inherent sparsity, burstiness, and overdispersion of such data
cause standard deep learning models, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer
(TFT), to produce unreliable long-horizon predictions. We introduce STFT-VNNGP,
a hybrid architecture that won the 2023 Algorithms for Threat Detection (ATD)
competition by overcoming these limitations. Designed to bridge this gap, our
model employs a two-stage process: first, a TFT captures complex temporal
dynamics to generate multi-quantile forecasts. These quantiles then serve as
informed inputs for a Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP),
which performs principled spatiotemporal smoothing and uncertainty
quantification. In a case study forecasting conflict dynamics in the Middle
East and the U.S., STFT-VNNGP consistently outperforms a standalone TFT,
showing a superior ability to predict the timing and magnitude of bursty event
periods, particularly at long-range horizons. This work offers a robust
framework for generating more reliable and actionable intelligence from
challenging event data, with all code and workflows made publicly available to
ensure reproducibility.

*Yann Kerzreho*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to approximate learning dynamics in multi-agent reinforcement learning within a Markov game by rescaling learning rates and update frequencies, providing a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and analyzing the learning dynamics of multiple reinforcement learning agents in Markov games is complex due to the stochastic and fast-changing nature of the game states.

Method: The technique involves rescaling the agents' learning rates (slower) and update frequencies (faster) while assuming ergodicity and update continuity to derive a convergence to a deterministic ordinary differential equation.

Result: The rescaled learning process converges to a tractable ODE that effectively approximates the complex dynamics of RL agents in Markov games.

Conclusion: This approach offers a practical and deterministic approximation framework for multi-agent RL learning dynamics, simplifying analysis and implementation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for approximating the learning dynamics
of multiple reinforcement learning (RL) agents interacting in a finite-state
Markov game. The idea is to rescale the learning process by simultaneously
reducing the learning rate and increasing the update frequency, effectively
treating the agent's parameters as a slow-evolving variable influenced by the
fast-mixing game state. Under mild assumptions-ergodicity of the state process
and continuity of the updates-we prove the convergence of this rescaled process
to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE provides a tractable,
deterministic approximation of the agent's learning dynamics. An implementation
of the framework is available at\,:

### [301] [Hyperspherical Variational Autoencoders Using Efficient Spherical Cauchy Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21278)
*Lukas Sablica,Kurt Hornik*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a VAE architecture using spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distributions that improve hyperspherical representations and offer better numerical stability and efficiency for high-dimensional generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gaussian latent spaces and von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions face issues in hyperspherical representations, such as over-regularization, numerical instability, and lack of flexibility. There is a need for a method that effectively captures directional data while overcoming these drawbacks.

Method: The authors propose using a spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent space in VAEs. It employs M"obius transformations for a stable reparameterization trick and calculates KL divergence using a power series, avoiding instability issues tied to vMF distributions.

Result: The spCauchy-based VAE is numerically stable, avoids common computation pitfalls (e.g., normalization constants, hypergeometric function ratios), and provides a more expressive and efficient latent representation for generative modeling.

Conclusion: The spCauchy distribution demonstrates significant theoretical and practical advantages over traditional approaches, making it a promising option for improving VAE performance in high-dimensional data.

Abstract: We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture that employs a
spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution. Unlike traditional Gaussian
latent spaces or the widely used von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, spCauchy
provides a more natural hyperspherical representation of latent variables,
better capturing directional data while maintaining flexibility. Its
heavy-tailed nature prevents over-regularization, ensuring efficient latent
space utilization while offering a more expressive representation.
Additionally, spCauchy circumvents the numerical instabilities inherent to vMF,
which arise from computing normalization constants involving Bessel functions.
Instead, it enables a fully differentiable and efficient reparameterization
trick via M\"obius transformations, allowing for stable and scalable training.
The KL divergence can be computed through a rapidly converging power series,
eliminating concerns of underflow or overflow associated with evaluation of
ratios of hypergeometric functions. These properties make spCauchy a compelling
alternative for VAEs, offering both theoretical advantages and practical
efficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.

### [302] [Wild refitting for black box prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21460)
*Martin J. Wainwright*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computationally efficient technique called 'wild refitting' for upper-bounding instance-wise prediction error using a single dataset and black-box methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prediction error estimation in nonparametric models while addressing complexities like noise heterogeneity.

Method: The 'wild refitting' method involves computing residuals, symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor, and solving a modified prediction problem centered at the current estimate.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show wild refitting provides high-probability bounds on prediction error under mild conditions. Examples include structure-from-motion and image restoration.

Conclusion: Wild refitting offers a robust framework for prediction error upper bound estimation with applicability across diverse problem domains.

Abstract: We describe and analyze a computionally efficient refitting procedure for
computing high-probability upper bounds on the instance-wise mean-squared
prediction error of penalized nonparametric estimates based on least-squares
minimization. Requiring only a single dataset and black box access to the
prediction method, it consists of three steps: computing suitable residuals,
symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor $\rho$, and using them to
define and solve a modified prediction problem recentered at the current
estimate. We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual
symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions
allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on
its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise
scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical
analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how
the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild
sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the
block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to
various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with
structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural
network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian invariant sampling methods improving the efficiency of established sampling algorithms like RWM and MALA by leveraging the Gaussian invariance to reduce estimator variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance statistical efficiency and variance reduction in sampling methods for estimating Gaussian and complex target distributions.

Method: Develop Gaussian invariant adaptations of RWM, MALA, and Second Order Hessian methods, applying analytic Poisson equation solutions and control variates for variance reduction.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate superior performance in high-dimensional latent Gaussian models, achieving state-of-the-art results and theoretical validation of sampler efficiency and scaling relations.

Conclusion: Gaussian invariant sampling methods significantly improve statistical efficiency and estimator accuracy, with promising applications to complex distributions shown both theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: We develop sampling methods, which consist of Gaussian invariant versions of
random walk Metropolis (RWM), Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and
second order Hessian or Manifold MALA. Unlike standard RWM and MALA we show
that Gaussian invariant sampling can lead to ergodic estimators with improved
statistical efficiency. This is due to a remarkable property of Gaussian
invariance that allows us to obtain exact analytical solutions to the Poisson
equation for Gaussian targets. These solutions can be used to construct
efficient and easy to use control variates for variance reduction of estimators
under any intractable target. We demonstrate the new samplers and estimators in
several examples, including high dimensional targets in latent Gaussian models
where we compare against several advanced methods and obtain state-of-the-art
results. We also provide theoretical results regarding geometric ergodicity,
and an optimal scaling analysis that shows the dependence of the optimal
acceptance rate on the Gaussianity of the target.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create a generalized framework for extending binary outer-totalistic cellular automata models (like the Game of Life) to more complex network environments.

Method: The study defines a family of outer-totalistic network automata, measures their characteristics using genotype (e.g., Derrida curve) and phenotype, and applies these metrics to solve the firing squad synchronization problem.

Result: The authors show over 90% success in solving the firing squad problem, demonstrating the practical utility of their model and metrics.

Conclusion: The developed framework provides a meaningful extension of cellular automata models, backed by theoretical insights and practical results, advancing the modeling and solutions in networked systems.

Abstract: We present a strong theoretical foundation that frames a well-defined family
of outer-totalistic network automaton models as a topological generalisation of
binary outer-totalistic cellular automata, of which the Game of Life is one
notable particular case. These "Life-like network automata" are quantitatively
described by expressing their genotype (the mean field curve and Derrida curve)
and phenotype (the evolution of the state and defect averages). After
demonstrating that the genotype and phenotype are correlated, we illustrate the
utility of these essential metrics by tackling the firing squad synchronisation
problem in a bottom-up fashion, with results that exceed a 90% success rate.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoTex, a framework for seamless 3D texture synthesis using video generation models to address spatial and temporal inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current texture synthesis methods struggle with inconsistencies due to limited global context and lack of geometric comprehension.

Method: VideoTex leverages video generation models with geometry-aware conditions and a UV diffusion strategy to ensure coherent and high-quality textures.

Result: Extensive experiments show that VideoTex surpasses previous methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and temporal stability.

Conclusion: VideoTex offers a significant improvement in dynamic real-time 3D-texture synthesis and opens possibilities for applications requiring both visual quality and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed
viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and
geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation
models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent
videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless
texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both
spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates
geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.
Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances
the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting
in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother
transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally
stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and
stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both
visual quality and temporal coherence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Generative Blocks World," a technique for interacting with generated images by editing scenes as assemblies of simple 3D geometric primitives, enabling high-quality image generation and scene manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in interacting with generated images, such as texture inconsistency and poor editability, by enabling flexible scene editing without sacrificing visual fidelity or object identity.

Method: They propose using scenes composed of convex 3D primitives with flexibility in granularity. A flow-based image generation method is used, conditioned on depth and a texture hint adapted for edits.

Result: The approach allows accurate object and camera manipulation while preserving object identity and achieves superior visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: This method enhances image generation by enabling intuitive and flexible scene manipulation, outperforming existing approaches in maintaining texture consistency and object identity.

Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated
image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents
scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be
represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move
either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been
edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on
depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D
primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value
caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera
moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous models entangling hair and face in 3D human head generation.

Method: The approach uses template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, dual generators with cross-attention, and synthetic renderings for training.

Result: 3DGH enables advanced 3D head generation with separable components, outperforming state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 3DGH provides an effective solution for composable 3D human head synthesis and hairstyle editing, confirmed through extensive experiments.

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with
composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the
modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data
representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable
hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across
different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D
GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention
mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is
trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to
stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive
experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both
qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D
GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image
synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing. More details will be available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable personalized, stylistically faithful, and narratively coherent storytelling for children by generating animations from a single drawing, addressing the gaps in character consistency, background styling, and expressive storytelling.

Method: The proposed system uses an MLLM for storyboarding, style propagation adapters for maintaining visual consistency, a shot design module for cinematic quality, and a 3D character reconstruction for motion sequences. The animation process involves fine-tuning an MMDiT-based image-to-video diffusion model and a two-stage motion customization adapter for temporal dynamics and appearance.

Result: FairyGen generates stylistically consistent and narratively rich cartoon videos from single sketches. Experiments validate its capability for creating animations with coherent motion and expressive storytelling.

Conclusion: FairyGen represents a significant step in personalized and engaging animations, combining cinematic storytelling and artistic fidelity. The code will be made publicly available to extend accessibility and usability.

Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon
videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique
artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on
character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles
character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates
cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a
single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured
storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,
character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we
introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual
style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's
full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design
module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame
cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the
story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically
plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based
image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion
customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from
temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second
stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen
identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent
video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,
narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for
personalized and engaging story animation. The code will be available at

### [309] [MegaFold: System-Level Optimizations for Accelerating Protein Structure Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20686)
*Hoa La,Ahan Gupta,Alex Morehead,Jianlin Cheng,Minjia Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: MegaFold is introduced as an optimized system for accelerating AlphaFold3 (AF3) training, addressing computational and memory bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational and memory costs in training AlphaFold3 (AF3), including issues stemming from 2D attention mechanisms, memory-intensive operators, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines.

Method: MegaFold employs techniques such as ahead-of-time caching to reduce GPU idle time, Triton-based kernels for efficient EvoAttention, and deep fusion for small operators in AF3.

Result: MegaFold reduces peak memory usage in AF3 by up to 1.23x and improves training time by up to 1.73x on NVIDIA GPUs and 1.62x on AMD GPUs. It also enables training with 1.35x longer sequence lengths.

Conclusion: MegaFold significantly enhances the scalability and efficiency of training modern protein folding models, including AF3, by addressing key computational bottlenecks and enabling longer sequence lengths.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models such as AlphaFold3 (AF3) push the
frontier of biomolecular modeling by incorporating science-informed
architectural changes to the transformer architecture. However, these advances
come at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive
operators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines,
which collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we
present MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold
tackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle
time from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for
memory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for
common and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and
AMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by
up to 1.23$\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to
1.73$\times$ and 1.62$\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables
training on 1.35$\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines
without running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of
modern protein folding models. We open source our code at

*Yangzhe Peng,Kaiyuan Gao,Liang He,Yuheng Cong,Haiguang Liu,Kun He,Lijun Wu*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper introduces CovDocker, a benchmark for covalent docking in drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current docking methods and deep learning approaches often neglect the formation of covalent bonds and related structural changes in protein-ligand interactions.

Method: The authors propose CovDocker, a benchmark framework that divides the covalent docking process into three tasks: reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent docking. Baseline performances using models like Uni-Mol and Chemformer demonstrate its capabilities.

Result: The benchmark improves accuracy in predicting interaction sites and the molecular transformations of covalent binding.

Conclusion: CovDocker acts as a valuable framework for advancing covalent drug design, highlighting the importance of data-driven approaches in developing covalent inhibitors and tackling challenges in therapeutic development.

Abstract: Molecular docking plays a crucial role in predicting the binding mode of
ligands to target proteins, and covalent interactions, which involve the
formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the target, are
particularly valuable due to their strong, enduring binding nature. However,
most existing docking methods and deep learning approaches hardly account for
the formation of covalent bonds and the associated structural changes. To
address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for covalent docking,
CovDocker, which is designed to better capture the complexities of covalent
binding. We decompose the covalent docking process into three main tasks:
reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent
docking. By adapting state-of-the-art models, such as Uni-Mol and Chemformer,
we establish baseline performances and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
benchmark in accurately predicting interaction sites and modeling the molecular
transformations involved in covalent binding. These results confirm the role of
the benchmark as a rigorous framework for advancing research in covalent drug
design. It underscores the potential of data-driven approaches to accelerate
the discovery of selective covalent inhibitors and addresses critical
challenges in therapeutic development.

### [311] [Hybrid Deep Learning and Signal Processing for Arabic Dialect Recognition in Low-Resource Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21386)
*Ghazal Al-Shwayyat,Omer Nezih Gerek*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes hybrid models combining traditional signal processing and deep learning to recognize Arabic dialects with limited datasets. The MFCC + CNN outperformed DWT + RNN with 91.2% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of Arabic dialect recognition with limited annotated datasets, particularly for underrepresented dialects.

Method: Two hybrid models were evaluated: MFCC + CNN and DWT + RNN, trained on a dialect-filtered subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset using speaker metadata for labels.

Result: The MFCC + CNN model achieved 91.2% accuracy, outperforming the Wavelet + RNN model, which had 66.5% accuracy.

Conclusion: Spectral features with convolutional models are effective for Arabic dialect recognition in low-resource conditions. The study highlights areas for improvement and provides a baseline for future research.

Abstract: Arabic dialect recognition presents a significant challenge in speech
technology due to the linguistic diversity of Arabic and the scarcity of large
annotated datasets, particularly for underrepresented dialects. This research
investigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal
processing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem
in low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with
a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered
subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based
on speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN
architecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and
strong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the
Wavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These
findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with
convolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working
with limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to
dataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization,
providing a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further
improvement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of
self-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural
architectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong
baseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within
resource-constrained environments.

*Jongyeon Park,Joonhee Lee,Do-Hyeon Lim,Hong Kook Kim,Hyeongcheol Geum,Jeong Eun Lim*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This report outlines methods to improve audio-tagging using additional features, label correction, and refined datasets, achieving a 14.7% improvement in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of mel-spectrograms in capturing subtle audio cues in mixed sounds and improve classification capabilities.

Method: Incorporating new audio features (spectral roll-off and chroma), applying agent-based label correction to reduce false positives, and refining the training data to improve accuracy for underperforming classes.

Result: The techniques led to a CA-SDRi performance improvement of up to 14.7% compared to the DCASE 2025 baseline.

Conclusion: By adding complementary features, correcting labels, and refining training data, audio-tagging effectiveness and classification accuracy were significantly enhanced.

Abstract: This technical report presents submission systems for Task 4 of the DCASE
2025 Challenge. This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral
roll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the
mel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an
audio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5)
system. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains
subtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus,
these additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model.
Second, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs
processed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the
final class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric.
Finally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy
of low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating
external data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of
data points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could
degrade model performance. The experiments demonstrate that the submit-ted
systems employing these approaches relatively improve CA-SDRi by up to 14.7%
compared to the baseline of DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.

*Huadai Liu,Jialei Wang,Kaicheng Luo,Wen Wang,Qian Chen,Zhou Zhao,Wei Xue*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: ThinkSound introduces a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning-based framework for generating and editing high-quality audio from video using multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Producing high-fidelity audio that accurately reflects the complex nuances of video content remains a difficult challenge in the video-to-audio generation domain.

Method: The process is broken into three stages: foundational sound generation, interactive refinement with user input, and targeted editing through natural language. It integrates CoT reasoning via a multimodal language model and a new dataset called AudioCoT for aligning visual, textual, and audio synthesis.

Result: ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across audio quality and CoT evaluation metrics, especially excelling in the out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark.

Conclusion: ThinkSound effectively leverages CoT reasoning, structured datasets, and multimodal modeling to set a new standard in video-to-audio generation while enabling advanced editing capabilities.

Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing
high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content
remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such
generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual
dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present
\textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for
videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages:
foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes,
interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and
targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a
multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning
that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce
\textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning
annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual
descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both
audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio
benchmark. The demo page is available at https://ThinkSound-Demo.github.io.

*Shrinivass Arunachalam Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive hybrid sorting paradigm that dynamically selects the most effective sorting algorithm based on real-time data features using a decision engine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static sorting algorithms that fail to perform optimally across all types of data distributions.

Method: A real-time feature extraction module computes data parameters like volume, range, and entropy, which are used by a decision engine (Finite State Machine and XGBoost classifier) to select between Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and QuickSort.

Result: Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate superior execution time, flexibility, and efficiency compared to traditional static sorting algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is scalable, efficient, and offers wide applicability to operations in big data analytics, edge computing, and systems with hardware constraints.

Abstract: Sorting is an essential operation in computer science with direct
consequences on the performance of large scale data systems, real-time systems,
and embedded computation. However, no sorting algorithm is optimal under all
distributions of data. The new adaptive hybrid sorting paradigm proposed in
this paper is the paradigm that automatically selects the most effective
sorting algorithm Counting Sort, Radix Sort, or QuickSort based on real-time
monitoring of patterns in input data. The architecture begins by having a
feature extraction module to compute significant parameters such as data
volume, value range and entropy. These parameters are sent to a decision engine
involving Finite State Machine and XGBoost classifier to aid smart and
effective in choosing the optimal sorting strategy. It implements Counting Sort
on small key ranges, Radix Sort on large range structured input with
low-entropy keys and QuickSort on general purpose sorting. The experimental
findings of both synthetic and real life dataset confirm that the proposed
solution is actually inclined to excel significantly by comparison in execution
time, flexibility and the efficiency of conventional static sorting algorithms.
The proposed framework provides a scalable, high perhaps and applicable to a
wide range of data processing operations like big data analytics, edge
computing, and systems with hardware limitations.

### [315] [Quantum Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent for Sector Rotation in the Taiwan Stock Market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20930)
*Chi-Sheng Chen,Xinyu Zhang,Ya-Chuan Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. While quantum-enhanced models achieve higher training rewards, classical models outperform in real-world investment metrics like cumulative return and Sharpe ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve reinforcement learning applications in financial sectors by leveraging quantum-enhanced models and addressing discrepancies between training rewards and real-world investment outcomes.

Method: The system combines Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), classical architectures (LSTM, Transformer), and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV, QASA) as policy and value networks, supported by an automated feature engineering pipeline.

Result: Empirical backtesting shows quantum-enhanced models yield higher training rewards but underperform classical models in cumulative return and Sharpe ratio, illuminating a mismatch between proxy reward signals and actual investment objectives.

Conclusion: Quantum circuits face expressiveness and instability challenges under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. Reward shaping, model regularization, and validation-based early stopping are proposed to address these discrepancies for better real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for
sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical
architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV,
QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline
extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent
model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key
finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training
rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics
such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core
challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely,
the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our
analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to
short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue
is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of
quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We
discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions
for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and
validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and
critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum
reinforcement learning in real-world finance.

Conclusion: Analog Rydberg atom quantum computers hold great potential for advancing neural ODE-based residual networks, and the ResQ framework offers a novel approach for enhancing classification tasks in quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Research in quantum machine learning has recently proliferated due to the
potential of quantum computing to accelerate machine learning. An area of
machine learning that has not yet been explored is neural ordinary differential
equation (neural ODE) based residual neural networks (ResNets), which aim to
improve the effectiveness of neural networks using the principles of ordinary
differential equations. In this work, we present our insights about why analog

introduce ResQ, a novel framework to optimize the dynamics of Rydberg atom
quantum computers to solve classification problems in machine learning using

TL;DR: The paper addresses scalability challenges in the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method for plasma simulations by introducing a novel approach to charge deposition using a particle-thread binding strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the scalability and performance of PIC simulations, particularly during the charge deposition phase, which often bottlenecks due to frequent particle-grid interactions.

Method: The authors propose a particle-thread binding strategy requiring only four private grids per node or per system. Their approach minimizes simultaneous access issues using flags and functions, while maintaining traditional data structures and requiring minimal code adjustments.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated significant scalability and performance improvements in both shared and distributed memory systems, with successful benchmarking on up to 1000 cores.

Conclusion: The novel charge deposition strategy enhances scalability without significant hardware dependencies, while allowing efficient particle-grid interactions in PIC simulations.

Abstract: The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method for plasma simulation tracks particle phase
space information using particle and grid data structures. High computational
costs in 2D and 3D device-scale PIC simulations necessitate parallelization,
with the Charge Deposition (CD) subroutine often becoming a bottleneck due to
frequent particle-grid interactions. Conventional methods mitigate dependencies
by generating private grids for each core, but this approach faces scalability
issues. We propose a novel approach based on a particle-thread binding strategy
that requires only four private grids per node in distributed memory systems or
four private grids in shared memory systems, enhancing CD scalability and
performance while maintaining conventional data structures and requiring
minimal changes to existing PIC codes. This method ensures complete
accessibility of grid data structure for concurrent threads and avoids
simultaneous access to particles within the same cell using additional
functions and flags. Performance evaluations using a PIC benchmark for
low-temperature partially magnetized E x B discharge simulation on a shared
memory as well as a distributed memory system (1000 cores) demonstrate the
method's scalability, and additionally, we show the method has little hardware
dependency.

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a program to improve the process of selecting research paper reviewers by analyzing references, extracting keywords, and ranking authors by citation metrics while excluding co-authors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in the peer review process given the growing volume of research papers and limited availability of suitable domain experts.

Method: The method involves analyzing paper references to identify relevant authors, extracting keywords from the topic, searching for top researchers and evaluating them using h-index, i10-index, and citation data. A ranking system is used, and co-authors are discarded from eligibility.

Result: The program identifies and ranks the top potential reviewers for research papers based on their expertise and citation metrics, while ensuring unbiased selection by removing co-authors.

Conclusion: The proposed automated program offers an efficient and fair strategy to select expert reviewers, potentially improving the peer review process in academia.

Abstract: Everyday, a vast stream of research documents is submitted to conferences,
anthologies, journals, newsletters, annual reports, daily papers, and various
periodicals. Many such publications use independent external specialists to
review submissions. This process is called peer review, and the reviewers are
called referees. However, it is not always possible to pick the best referee
for reviewing. Moreover, new research fields are emerging in every sector, and
the number of research papers is increasing dramatically. To review all these
papers, every journal assigns a small team of referees who may not be experts
in all areas. For example, a research paper in communication technology should
be reviewed by an expert from the same field. Thus, efficiently selecting the
best reviewer or referee for a research paper is a big challenge.
  In this research, we propose and implement program that uses a new strategy
to automatically select the best reviewers for a research paper. Every research
paper contains references at the end, usually from the same area. First, we
collect the references and count authors who have at least one paper in the
references. Then, we automatically browse the web to extract research topic
keywords. Next, we search for top researchers in the specific topic and count
their h-index, i10-index, and citations for the first n authors. Afterward, we
rank the top n authors based on a score and automatically browse their
homepages to retrieve email addresses. We also check their co-authors and
colleagues online and discard them from the list. The remaining top n authors,
generally professors, are likely the best referees for reviewing the research
paper.

*Alexander Selivanov,Philip Müller,Özgün Turgut,Nil Stolt-Ansó,Daniel Rückert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PTACL, a framework enhancing ECG data by incorporating information from CMR for improved cardiac diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG is cost-effective but lacks functional metrics like ventricular volume and ejection fraction, which require CMR—an expensive and less accessible alternative.

Method: PTACL employs multimodal contrastive learning with global (patient-level) and local (temporal-level) alignment losses to integrate ECG and CMR information.

Result: PTACL demonstrated superior performance on ECG-CMR data from 27,951 subjects in retrieving cardiac phenotypes and predicting cardiac function parameters.

Conclusion: PTACL bridges the gap between ECG and CMR, expanding diagnostic capability of ECG to include functional cardiac insights non-invasively.

Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for
detecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly
measure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection
fraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed
structural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To
bridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive
Learning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG
representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses
global patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive
loss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and
CMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart
embeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal
alignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with
corresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations
with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more
insights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without
introducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data
from 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL
achieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving
patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac
function parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our
results highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac
diagnostics using ECG. The code is available at:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces U-R-Veda, an advanced UNet model integrating multiple techniques like convolutions, transformers, and attention mechanisms for segmenting cardiac MRI images. It achieves superior performance with a 95.2% DSC accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automated and accurate segmentation of cardiac images, a prerequisite for diagnosing cardiac disorders and managing their treatment.

Method: The paper presents U-R-Veda, a deep learning model that combines convolutional transformations, vision transformers, attention mechanisms (channel and spatial), residual links, and edge-detection based skip connections. These components enhance feature extraction, spatial localization, and information retention.

Result: U-R-Veda achieves an average DSC accuracy of 95.2% and outperforms existing models in delineating right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium based on DSC and HD metrics.

Conclusion: The model offers a significant advancement in cardiac MRI segmentation, paving the way for better medical image analysis and aiding automated diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a
transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of
cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of
cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and
automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution
transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and
spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an
accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships
using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and
spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep
embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies
important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge
information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces
information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model
significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for
improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module
(channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show
that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The
model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD
metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and

*Shuwei Xing,Derek W. Cool,David Tessier,Elvis C. S. Chen,Terry M. Peters,Aaron Fenster*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for integrating 3D ultrasound into liver tumor ablation using a 2D US-CT/MRI registration method, achieving significant precision and runtime efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the clinical adoption of 3D ultrasound imaging in liver tumor ablation therapy by addressing the challenge of tumor identification and integrating it seamlessly into standard workflows.

Method: The authors proposed a registration method using 3D ultrasound as an intermediary for 2D US-CT/MRI alignment and introduced a multimodal image visualization technique for efficient verification.

Result: The proposed 2D US-CT/MRI registration achieved a landmark distance error of 2-4 mm with a runtime of 0.22 seconds per image pair. Non-rigid registration reduced alignment error by 40% compared to rigid registration.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrated the efficacy of 3D ultrasound in improving liver tumor ablation, paving the way for wider therapeutic adoption of 3D ultrasound in clinical settings.

Abstract: 3D ultrasound (US) imaging has shown significant benefits in enhancing the
outcomes of percutaneous liver tumour ablation. Its clinical integration is
crucial for transitioning 3D US into the therapeutic domain. However,
challenges of tumour identification in US images continue to hinder its broader
adoption. In this work, we propose a novel framework for integrating 3D US into
the standard ablation workflow. We present a key component, a clinically viable
2D US-CT/MRI registration approach, leveraging 3D US as an intermediary to
reduce registration complexity. To facilitate efficient verification of the
registration workflow, we also propose an intuitive multimodal image
visualization technique. In our study, 2D US-CT/MRI registration achieved a
landmark distance error of approximately 2-4 mm with a runtime of 0.22s per
image pair. Additionally, non-rigid registration reduced the mean alignment
error by approximately 40% compared to rigid registration. Results demonstrated
the efficacy of the proposed 2D US-CT/MRI registration workflow. Our
integration framework advanced the capabilities of 3D US imaging in improving
percutaneous tumour ablation, demonstrating the potential to expand the
therapeutic role of 3D US in clinical interventions.

*Shuki Maruyama,Hidenori Takeshima*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based spectral analysis method was developed to address inaccuracies caused by static magnetic field (B0) inhomogeneity, showing enhanced accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in spectral analysis accuracy arising from variations in static magnetic field (B0) inhomogeneity and to improve the robustness of spectral analysis.

Method: The authors introduced a deep learning model trained on spectra modeled to represent variations caused by B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were derived from B0 maps and metabolite ratios in healthy brains. The model's training incorporated measured, simulated, and modeled spectra. Performance was assessed using metrics like MSE and MAPE, with comparisons made against the LCModel.

Result: The proposed model achieved improved MSEs (49.89%) compared to models trained on measured spectra alone, and outperformed LCModel in terms of MAPE under different B0 inhomogeneities. Performance scaled with the number of modeled spectra used for training.

Conclusion: The study concludes that incorporating modeled spectra into training deep learning models can improve spectral analysis accuracy under B0 inhomogeneity, demonstrating the potential of this approach for enhanced analysis.

Abstract: Purpose:To develop a method that enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis
in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity. Methods:The authors
proposed a new spectral analysis method utilizing a deep learning model trained
on modeled spectra that consistently represent the spectral variations induced
by B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and
metabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a
patch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline
components were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled
spectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra.
The analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled
spectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared
errors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs)
of the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the
phantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The
modeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on
the B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The
analysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved
MSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by
26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra.
The performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to
1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both
types of B0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion:A new spectral analysis-trained deep
learning model using the modeled spectra was developed. The results suggest
that the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of spectral
analysis by increasing the training samples of spectra.

*Mohammed Baharoon,Jun Ma,Congyu Fang,Augustin Toma,Bo Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores design methodologies for 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in automating Radiology Report Generation, introduces new strategies for report augmentation, and achieves a significant improvement on the GREEN score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate and improve the application of 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in automating Radiology Report Generation (RRG), addressing challenges like effective model design and performance enhancement.

Method: The study evaluates various design aspects such as visual input representation, projection methods, LLM structures, and fine-tuning techniques for RRG. Additionally, it introduces knowledge-based report augmentation techniques to enhance model output.

Result: The proposed system improved performance on the GREEN score by up to 10%, achieving 2nd place in the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Notable findings include the size-independence of LLMs in certain training conditions, the limitations of larger volume sizes during training, and the benefits of incorporating segmentation masks.

Conclusion: RRG performance can be significantly optimized through careful design of 3D MLLMs, proper tuning techniques, and novel augmentation strategies, without reliance on larger LLM sizes. Segmentation masks and tailored volume sizes play a critical role in achieving better results.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to
automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically
investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input
representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning
techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based
report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up
to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our
results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely
independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show
that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT
was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a
segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is

### [325] [Uncover Treasures in DCT: Advancing JPEG Quality Enhancement by Exploiting Latent Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21171)
*Jing Yang,Qunliang Xing,Mai Xu,Minglang Qiao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper improves JPEG quality enhancement by proposing a DCT-domain approach that outperforms pixel-domain methods in both quality and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current JPEG quality enhancement methods, especially high computational costs in the pixel domain and limited performance in existing DCT-domain approaches.

Method: The paper identifies critical correlations within DCT coefficients and proposes the Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality Enhancement (AJQE) method to exploit these correlations, adapting pixel-domain models to the DCT domain.

Result: The AJQE method achieves a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5% increase in enhancement throughput over pixel-domain counterparts.

Conclusion: The AJQE method effectively enhances JPEG image quality with reduced complexity, offering a significant performance improvement over existing approaches.

Abstract: Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) achieves data compression by
quantizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, which inevitably
introduces compression artifacts. Most existing JPEG quality enhancement
methods operate in the pixel domain, suffering from the high computational
costs of decoding. Consequently, direct enhancement of JPEG images in the DCT
domain has gained increasing attention. However, current DCT-domain methods
often exhibit limited performance. To address this challenge, we identify two
critical types of correlations within the DCT coefficients of JPEG images.
Building on this insight, we propose an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality
Enhancement (AJQE) method that fully exploits these correlations. The AJQE
method enables the adaptation of numerous well-established pixel-domain models
to the DCT domain, achieving superior performance with reduced computational
complexity. Compared to the pixel-domain counterparts, the DCT-domain models
derived by our method demonstrate a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5%
increase in enhancement throughput on average.

*Qifei Cui,Xinyu Lu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for brain tumor segmentation using pre-trained GANs and Unet architectures, along with anomaly detection and synthetic augmentation for improved precision and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets in medical imaging motivates the development of robust and scalable segmentation methods for brain tumors.

Method: The study combines GANs with Unet-like architectures, using adversarial loss, anomaly detection modules, and synthetic data augmentation to refine tumor segmentation from MRI scans.

Result: The approach shows superior lesion-wise Dice and HD95 performance compared to baselines, validated on the BraTS dataset.

Conclusion: The method efficiently segments brain tumors with greater accuracy and robustness, addressing annotated data limitations while being scalable for clinical use.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for brain tumor segmentation
leveraging pre-trained GANs and Unet architectures. By combining a global
anomaly detection module with a refined mask generation network, the proposed
model accurately identifies tumor-sensitive regions and iteratively enhances
segmentation precision using adversarial loss constraints. Multi-modal MRI data
and synthetic image augmentation are employed to improve robustness and address
the challenge of limited annotated datasets. Experimental results on the BraTS
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving high
sensitivity and accuracy in both lesion-wise Dice and HD95 metrics than the
baseline. This scalable method minimizes the dependency on fully annotated
data, paving the way for practical real-world applications in clinical
settings.

### [327] [Lightweight Physics-Informed Zero-Shot Ultrasound Plane Wave Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21499)
*Hojat Asgariandehkordi,Mostafa Sharifzadeh,Hassan Rivaz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a zero-shot denoising approach for Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) tailored for low-angle acquisitions, improving contrast and reducing noise without requiring pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of CPWC that arise due to low frame rate, blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets, and susceptibility to noise, especially with fewer transmission angles.

Method: The proposed method involves dividing transmission angles into disjoint subsets to create noisy compounded images, using self-supervised residual learning to train a lightweight deep model for denoising.

Result: Evaluations on simulation, phantom, and in vivo data show the proposed method outperforms classical and deep learning-based denoising methods in structure preservation and contrast enhancement.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient, physics-informed, and adaptable solution for ultrasound imaging, requiring no domain-specific fine-tuning or paired data.

Abstract: Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) enhances image contrast by
combining echoes from multiple steered transmissions. While increasing the
number of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the
frame rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.
Moreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when
acquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot
denoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances
contrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the
available transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form
compound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are
then used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,
enabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical
structures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while
the underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows
the network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the
consistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no
domain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across
anatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports
efficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight
architecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on
simulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement
and structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based
denoising methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces biodiversity considerations into computing sustainability, proposing metrics and a framework to quantify impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biodiversity loss is critical but overlooked in computing sustainability efforts due to the lack of suitable metrics and models.

Method: Developed two metrics (EBI and OBI) to measure biodiversity impacts and introduced the FABRIC framework to link workloads to these impacts.

Result: Evaluated the approach, demonstrating the necessity to include biodiversity in sustainable computing alongside carbon and water.

Conclusion: Integrating biodiversity considerations enhances sustainable computing design and optimization, addressing a critical environmental margin.

Abstract: Biodiversity loss is a critical planetary boundary, yet its connection to
computing remains largely unexamined. Prior sustainability efforts in computing
have focused on carbon and water, overlooking biodiversity due to the lack of
appropriate metrics and modeling frameworks. This paper presents the first
end-to-end analysis of biodiversity impact from computing systems. We introduce
two new metrics--Embodied Biodiversity Index (EBI) and Operational Biodiversity
Index (OBI)--to quantify biodiversity impact across the lifecycle, and present
FABRIC, a modeling framework that links computing workloads to biodiversity
impacts. Our evaluation highlights the need to consider biodiversity alongside
carbon and water in sustainable computing design and optimization. The code is

### [329] [Our Coding Adventure: Using LLMs to Personalise the Narrative of a Tangible Programming Robot for Preschoolers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20982)
*Martin Ruskov*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating personalized storytelling to help preschoolers learn robotic programming, without directly exposing children to the technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to leverage LLMs for educational purposes while addressing risks related to overexposure of children to screens and misuse of the models.

Method: The researchers used a programming robot named Cubetto and employed open-weight, model-agnostic LLMs to generate personalized learning materials. They tested the approach with five different LLMs and documented the creation process, prompts, and learning outcomes.

Result: The approach allowed successful generation of game stories for teachers to use as aids, though issues like consistency and hallucinations were encountered. Strategies to address these issues were partially effective.

Conclusion: The method has potential as an educational tool for preschool children by benefiting teachers without directly exposing kids to LLMs. Further real-world testing is planned.

Abstract: Finding balanced ways to employ Large Language Models (LLMs) in education is
a challenge due to inherent risks of poor understanding of the technology and
of a susceptible audience. This is particularly so with younger children, who
are known to have difficulties with pervasive screen time. Working with a
tangible programming robot called Cubetto, we propose an approach to benefit
from the capabilities of LLMs by employing such models in the preparation of
personalised storytelling, necessary for preschool children to get accustomed
to the practice of commanding the robot. We engage in action research to
develop an early version of a formalised process to rapidly prototype game
stories for Cubetto. Our approach has both reproducible results, because it
employs open weight models, and is model-agnostic, because we test it with 5
different LLMs. We document on one hand the process, the used materials and
prompts, and on the other the learning experience and outcomes. We deem the
generation successful for the intended purposes of using the results as a
teacher aid. Testing the models on 4 different task scenarios, we encounter
issues of consistency and hallucinations and document the corresponding
evaluation process and attempts (some successful and some not) to overcome
these issues. Importantly, the process does not expose children to LLMs
directly. Rather, the technology is used to help teachers easily develop
personalised narratives on children's preferred topics. We believe our method
is adequate for preschool classes and we are planning to further experiment in
real-world educational settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Transformer-based framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes, overcoming limitations of classical statistical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing classical statistical models have limitations in estimating counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes, which are essential for understanding real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes a framework utilizing the Transformer to estimate counterfactual outcomes. The estimator is mathematically proven to be consistent and asymptotically normal under mild assumptions.

Result: Through simulation and real data experiments, the proposed method demonstrates superior estimation capability compared to baseline methods and provides insights into the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in Colombia.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly advances the estimation of counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes, validated by both synthetic and real-world data, offering practical understanding of important causal relationships.

Abstract: The real world naturally has dimensions of time and space. Therefore,
estimating the counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is a
crucial problem. However, previous methods are based on classical statistical
models, which still have limitations in performance and generalization. This
paper proposes a novel framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with
spatial-temporal attributes using the Transformer, exhibiting stronger
estimation ability. Under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator within this
framework is consistent and asymptotically normal. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulation experiments and real data
experiments. Simulation experiments show that our estimator has a stronger
estimation capability than baseline methods. Real data experiments provide a
valuable conclusion to the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in
Colombia. The source code is available at

TL;DR: This paper uses partial differential equation (PDE) discovery to model meso-scale dynamics in biological systems from micro-scale data, focusing on astrocyte calcium diffusion and assessing five PDE discovery methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and bridging gaps between spatial and temporal scales in complex biological systems, where behaviors are non-linear and underlying physical principles are often unknown.

Method: A framework combining particle-based simulations with PDE discovery. The paper evaluates five state-of-the-art PDE discovery methods through simulations of calcium diffusion in astrocytes.

Result: Several PDE discovery methods accurately recover the diffusion term and predict temporal variations of calcium concentration in astrocytes.

Conclusion: PDE discovery shows promise in capturing macroscopic dynamics in challenging biological systems through microscopic data.

Abstract: Biological systems are non-linear, include unobserved variables and the
physical principles that govern their dynamics are partly unknown. This makes
the characterization of their behavior very challenging. Notably, their
activity occurs on multiple interdependent spatial and temporal scales that
require linking mechanisms across scales. To address the challenge of bridging
gaps between scales, we leverage partial differential equations (PDE)
discovery. PDE discovery suggests meso-scale dynamics characteristics from
micro-scale data. In this article, we present our framework combining
particle-based simulations and PDE discovery and conduct preliminary
experiments to assess equation discovery in controlled settings. We evaluate
five state-of-the-art PDE discovery methods on particle-based simulations of
calcium diffusion in astrocytes. The performances of the methods are evaluated
on both the form of the discovered equation and the forecasted temporal
variations of calcium concentration. Our results show that several methods
accurately recover the diffusion term, highlighting the potential of PDE
discovery for capturing macroscopic dynamics in biological systems from
microscopic data.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bayesian model to analyze astrophysical data across wavelengths, focusing on separating diffuse, point-like, and extended emission components while addressing model misspecifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern observatories produce complex astrophysical data, requiring robust methods for separating components and addressing noise and instrumental effects for accurate analysis.

Method: The authors developed a multi-frequency Bayesian model leveraging latent-space tension to detect and rectify model misspecifications, guiding the incorporation of new sky emission components systematically.

Result: The approach showed effectiveness in synthetic data and real observational data, achieving precise localization, robust separation, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification in the analysis.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a versatile and robust framework suitable for analyzing diverse astronomical datasets, supporting advanced next-generation observatory capabilities.

Abstract: Modern observatories are designed to deliver increasingly detailed views of
astrophysical signals. To fully realize the potential of these observations,
principled data-analysis methods are required to effectively separate and
reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components from data corrupted by
noise and instrumental effects. In this work, we introduce a novel
multi-frequency Bayesian model of the sky emission field that leverages
latent-space tension as an indicator of model misspecification, enabling
automated separation of diffuse, point-like, and extended astrophysical
emission components across wavelength bands. Deviations from latent-space prior
expectations are used as diagnostics for model misspecification, thus
systematically guiding the introduction of new sky components, such as
point-like and extended sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
method on synthetic multi-frequency imaging data and apply it to observational
X-ray data from the eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) of the SN1987A region in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our results highlight the method's capability
to reconstruct astrophysical components with high accuracy, achieving sub-pixel
localization of point sources, robust separation of extended emission, and
detailed uncertainty quantification. The developed methodology offers a general
and well-founded framework applicable to a wide variety of astronomical
datasets, and is therefore well suited to support the analysis needs of
next-generation multi-wavelength and multi-messenger surveys.

*Xiaoyun Gong,Sloan Nietert,Ziv Goldfeld*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper addresses the sensitivity of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) alignment to data contamination and proposes a robust estimator based on the partial GW distance to mitigate distortions caused by outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW alignment is crucial for matching internal structures across datasets but becomes unreliable under data contamination caused by outliers.

Method: The paper introduces an estimator using the partial GW distance, which trims a fraction of mass from datasets before performing alignment. Theoretical analyses and structural insights are provided to validate its robustness.

Result: The proposed robust estimator is minimax optimal in population data and near-optimal in finite samples, successfully handling contamination with minimal performance gaps.

Conclusion: The partial GW distance is validated as a robust alternative to classical GW distance, mitigating contamination effects and promoting reliable dataset alignment.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problem provides a powerful framework for
aligning heterogeneous datasets by matching their internal structures in a way
that minimizes distortion. However, GW alignment is sensitive to data
contamination by outliers, which can greatly distort the resulting matching
scheme. To address this issue, we study robust GW alignment, where upon
observing contaminated versions of the clean data distributions, our goal is to
accurately estimate the GW alignment cost between the original (uncontaminated)
measures. We propose an estimator based on the partial GW distance, which trims
out a fraction of the mass from each distribution before optimally aligning the
rest. The estimator is shown to be minimax optimal in the population setting
and is near-optimal in the finite-sample regime, where the optimality gap
originates only from the suboptimality of the plug-in estimator in the
empirical estimation setting (i.e., without contamination). Towards the
analysis, we derive new structural results pertaining to the approximate
pseudo-metric structure of the partial GW distance. Overall, our results endow
the partial GW distance with an operational meaning by posing it as a robust
surrogate of the classical distance when the observed data may be contaminated.

TL;DR: The study explores how haptic feedback in VR influences walking behavior in dense pedestrian flows, finding enhanced sensitivity to collisions and altered movement patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effects of haptic feedback on user behavior in crowded VR environments, particularly regarding collision avoidance and awareness.

Method: The paper conducted a user study to assess walking patterns, trajectory length, pelvis angle displacement, and user awareness with and without haptic feedback in a dense VR pedestrian setting.

Result: Haptic feedback was found to increase walking trajectory length, pelvis angle changes, responsiveness to collisions, visual exploration, and variation in walking speed.

Conclusion: Haptic feedback improves users' collision sensitivity and awareness, influencing walking behaviors in VR simulations, which can benefit applications like emergency training.

Abstract: Human crowd simulation in virtual reality (VR) is a powerful tool with
potential applications including emergency evacuation training and assessment
of building layout. While haptic feedback in VR enhances immersive experience,
its effect on walking behavior in dense and dynamic pedestrian flows is
unknown. Through a user study, we investigated how haptic feedback changes user
walking motion in crowded pedestrian flows in VR. The results indicate that
haptic feedback changed users' collision avoidance movements, as measured by
increased walking trajectory length and change in pelvis angle. The
displacements of users' lateral position and pelvis angle were also increased
in the instantaneous response to a collision with a non-player character (NPC),
even when the NPC was inside the field of view. Haptic feedback also enhanced
users' awareness and visual exploration when an NPC approached from the side
and back. Furthermore, variation in walking speed was increased by the haptic
feedback. These results suggested that the haptic feedback enhanced users'
sensitivity to a collision in VR environment.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores how chatbot anthropomorphism, such as human-like traits and emotional expressions, can encourage empathy and prosocial behavior from humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what factors motivate humans to help chatbots, addressing the gap in research on human-chatbot interaction.

Method: An online experiment involving 244 participants, where chatbots made intentional mistakes and explained them during a collaborative task. Participants' empathy and prosocial actions were measured.

Result: Human identity and emotional expression in chatbots enhanced empathy, leading to increased prosocial behavior. Two motivations behind human actions were identified: chatbot empathy and perceiving chatbots as human-like.

Conclusion: Anthropomorphic features in chatbots foster empathy and encourage humans to behave more prosocially toward them, with implications for improved chatbot design and human-chatbot collaboration.

Abstract: Chatbots are increasingly integrated into people's lives and are widely used
to help people. Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse
direction-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better
chatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However,
little research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots.
To address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA)
framework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like
identity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human
empathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and
intentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial
behaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which
chatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the
reasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and
intentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and
emotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and
intention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects. Qualitative
analysis further identified two motivations for participants' prosocial
behaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like. We
discuss the implications of these results for understanding and promoting human
prosocial behaviors toward chatbots.

TL;DR: This study investigates how a healthcare robot's transparency and sociability influence user trust and decision-making when provided with conflicting information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address trust and decision-making concerns that arise when intelligent healthcare robots give users advice contradicting their memory, as such robots are becoming more viable for home use.

Method: A 2x2 between-subjects online study was conducted with 176 participants who watched videos of a family healthcare assistant robot suggesting medication timings that disagreed with what the user remembered.

Result: Findings reveal that higher robot transparency caused users to attribute discrepancies to external factors rather than their own memory errors, and participants often overtrusted robots, even suspecting malfunctions or third-party interference.

Conclusion: Transparency mechanisms in healthcare robots significantly influence user behavior, but overtrust in such robots poses potential risks in sensitive contexts like healthcare management.

Abstract: Advancements in robotic capabilities for providing physical assistance,
psychological support, and daily health management are making the deployment of
intelligent healthcare robots in home environments increasingly feasible in the
near future. However, challenges arise when the information provided by these
robots contradicts users' memory, raising concerns about user trust and
decision-making. This paper presents a study that examines how varying a
robot's level of transparency and sociability influences user interpretation,
decision-making and perceived trust when faced with conflicting information
from a robot. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects online study, 176 participants
watched videos of a Furhat robot acting as a family healthcare assistant and
suggesting a fictional user to take medication at a different time from that
remembered by the user. Results indicate that robot transparency influenced
users' interpretation of information discrepancies: with a low transparency
robot, the most frequent assumption was that the user had not correctly
remembered the time, while with the high transparency robot, participants were
more likely to attribute the discrepancy to external factors, such as a partner
or another household member modifying the robot's information. Additionally,
participants exhibited a tendency toward overtrust, often prioritizing the
robot's recommendations over the user's memory, even when suspecting system
malfunctions or third-party interference. These findings highlight the impact
of transparency mechanisms in robotic systems, the complexity and importance
associated with system access control for multi-user robots deployed in home
environments, and the potential risks of users' over reliance on robots in
sensitive domains such as healthcare.

*Saloni Singh,Koen Hndriks,Drik Heylen,Kim Baraka*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A systematic review of 62 co-creative systems identifies design dimensions aiding human creativity, emphasizing user control, proactive AI, and social transparency while pinpointing gaps in early creative phases and adaptation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build better, tailored co-creative systems by understanding design considerations from prior research.

Method: Conducted a systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems spanning areas like visual arts, design, and writing.

Result: Identified key design dimensions (e.g., user control, AI proactivity, system embodiment) and proposed 24 design considerations to boost efficiency, trust, and collaboration.

Conclusion: High user control and adaptive, context-sensitive proactive systems enhance trust and satisfaction, but gaps like early creative phase support and user adaptation challenges need addressing.

Abstract: The co creativity community is making significant progress in developing more
sophisticated and tailored systems to support and enhance human creativity.
Design considerations from prior work can serve as a valuable and efficient
foundation for future systems. To support this effort, we conducted a
systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems. These papers
cover a diverse range of applications, including visual arts, design, and
writing, where the AI acts not just as a tool but as an active collaborator in
the creative process. From this review, we identified several key dimensions
relevant to system design: phase of the creative process, creative task,
proactive behavior of the system, user control, system embodiment, and AI model
type. Our findings suggest that systems offering high user control lead to
greater satisfaction, trust, and a stronger sense of ownership over creative
outcomes. Furthermore, proactive systems, when adaptive and context sensitive,
can enhance collaboration. We also extracted 24 design considerations,
highlighting the value of encouraging users to externalize their thoughts and
of increasing the system's social presence and transparency to foster trust.
Despite recent advancements, important gaps remain, such as limited support for
early creative phases like problem clarification, and challenges related to
user adaptation to AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset and LLMs designed for understanding and reconstructing data visualizations effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models struggle with visualizations as they fail to decode mapping rules between data and visual elements and extract structured information.

Method: The authors propose a dataset and methodology combining chart images with vectorized representations, encoding schemes, and data features to train specialized visualization LLMs.

Result: The study shows marked improvements in the accuracy of data extraction and the quality of chart reconstructions.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective solution for enhancing data visualization comprehension and reconstruction using multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Visualizations are crucial for data communication, yet understanding them
requires comprehension of both visual elements and their underlying data
relationships. Current multimodal large models, while effective in natural
image understanding, struggle with visualization due to their inability to
decode the data-to-visual mapping rules and extract structured information. To
address these challenges, we present a novel dataset and train multimodal
visualization LLMs specifically designed for understanding. Our approach
combines chart images with their corresponding vectorized representations,
encoding schemes, and data features. The proposed vector format enables compact
and accurate reconstruction of visualization content. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both data extraction accuracy and chart
reconstruction quality.

*Zhonghao Zhan,Huichi Zhou,Hamed Haddadi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance intrusion detection systems, focusing on resilience against adversarial attacks and generalization issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs have shown promise in detecting network intrusions but face challenges from distribution drift and adversarial attacks in IoT environments.

Method: The paper employs LLMs to act as cybersecurity expert agents that analyze graph structures from network flow data, aiming to identify and mitigate suspicious elements before GNN processing.

Result: Experimental analysis indicates that LLM integration significantly improves the performance of GNN-based intrusion detection systems against various forms of adversarial attacks, tested on realistic datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs into intrusion detection frameworks provides a robust complementary layer that enhances the resilience and generalization of GNNs in cybersecurity systems.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show great promise for Network Intrusion
Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly in IoT environments, but suffer
performance degradation due to distribution drift and lack robustness against
realistic adversarial attacks. Current robustness evaluations often rely on
unrealistic synthetic perturbations and lack demonstrations on systematic
analysis of different kinds of adversarial attack, which encompass both
black-box and white-box scenarios. This work proposes a novel approach to
enhance GNN robustness and generalization by employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in an agentic pipeline as simulated cybersecurity expert agents. These
agents scrutinize graph structures derived from network flow data, identifying
and potentially mitigating suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements
before GNN processing. Our experiments, using a framework designed for
realistic evaluation and testing with a variety of adversarial attacks
including a dataset collected from physical testbed experiments, demonstrate
that integrating LLM analysis can significantly improve the resilience of
GNN-based NIDS against challenges, showcasing the potential of LLM agent as a
complementary layer in intrusion detection architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical challenges in ensuring trustworthy computational provenance for LLMs, particularly in regulated sectors like healthcare requiring strict data-use compliance.

Method: The ZKPROV framework cryptographically binds a trained model to authorized datasets using zero-knowledge proofs, without requiring proof of every training step, leveraging dataset-signed metadata and model parameter commitments.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate ZKPROV's efficiency and scalability in generating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: ZKPROV ensures dataset confidentiality while providing sound, privacy-focused assurances of training dataset provenance, with formal security guarantees for sensitive domain applications.

Abstract: As the deployment of large language models (LLMs) grows in sensitive domains,
ensuring the integrity of their computational provenance becomes a critical
challenge, particularly in regulated sectors such as healthcare, where strict
requirements are applied in dataset usage. We introduce ZKPROV, a novel
cryptographic framework that enables zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance.
It allows users to verify that a model is trained on a reliable dataset without
revealing sensitive information about it or its parameters. Unlike prior
approaches that focus on complete verification of the training process
(incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution
environments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance. Our method cryptographically
binds a trained model to its authorized training dataset(s) through
zero-knowledge proofs while avoiding proof of every training step. By
leveraging dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments,
ZKPROV provides sound and privacy-preserving assurances that the result of the
LLM is derived from a model trained on the claimed authorized and relevant
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the
ZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical
solution for real-world deployments. We also provide formal security
guarantees, proving that our approach preserves dataset confidentiality while
ensuring trustworthy dataset provenance.

*Osama Zafar,Rosemarie Santa González,Mina Namazi,Alfonso Morales,Erman Ayday*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a privacy-preserving framework for secure data sharing in agriculture, combining PCA and differential privacy, validated on real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy concerns that prevent farmers from sharing data for advancing data-driven agriculture.

Method: Utilized dimensionality reduction (PCA) and differential privacy (Laplacian noise) coupled with federated learning or aggregated data models.

Result: Validated the framework on real-life datasets showcasing robust privacy protection and utility performance comparable to centralized systems.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates secure collaboration in agriculture, enabling innovation and sustainability while addressing privacy concerns.

Abstract: Data-driven agriculture, which integrates technology and data into
agricultural practices, has the potential to improve crop yield, disease
resilience, and long-term soil health. However, privacy concerns, such as
adverse pricing, discrimination, and resource manipulation, deter farmers from
sharing data, as it can be used against them. To address this barrier, we
propose a privacy-preserving framework that enables secure data sharing and
collaboration for research and development while mitigating privacy risks. The
framework combines dimensionality reduction techniques (like Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)) and differential privacy by introducing Laplacian
noise to protect sensitive information. The proposed framework allows
researchers to identify potential collaborators for a target farmer and train
personalized machine learning models either on the data of identified
collaborators via federated learning or directly on the aggregated
privacy-protected data. It also allows farmers to identify potential
collaborators based on similarities. We have validated this on real-life
datasets, demonstrating robust privacy protection against adversarial attacks
and utility performance comparable to a centralized system. We demonstrate how
this framework can facilitate collaboration among farmers and help researchers
pursue broader research objectives. The adoption of the framework can empower
researchers and policymakers to leverage agricultural data responsibly, paving
the way for transformative advances in data-driven agriculture. By addressing
critical privacy challenges, this work supports secure data integration,
fostering innovation and sustainability in agricultural systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel neural network-based method for estimating governing equation parameters, focusing on system identification and uncertainty quantification, validated using generative modeling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the integration of experimental data with scientific theories to better understand and predict the dynamics of nonlinear structural systems.

Method: The proposed method involves a neural network that maps random noise to physical parameters, which are then validated using a discriminator network to distinguish between real and generated data. Mean square error loss is used for data comparison.

Result: The method demonstrates strong parameter estimation accuracy and robust model validation across analytical and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines generative modeling and neural networks for structural system identification, enabling accurate parameter estimation and reliable model validation for complex systems.

Abstract: Estimating the governing equation parameter values is essential for
integrating experimental data with scientific theory to understand, validate,
and predict the dynamics of complex systems. In this work, we propose a new
method for structural system identification (SI), uncertainty quantification,
and validation directly from data. Inspired by generative modeling frameworks,
a neural network maps random noise to physically meaningful parameters. These
parameters are then used in the known equation of motion to obtain fake
accelerations, which are compared to real training data via a mean square error
loss. To simultaneously validate the learned parameters, we use independent
validation datasets. The generated accelerations from these datasets are
evaluated by a discriminator network, which determines whether the output is
real or fake, and guides the parameter-generator network. Analytical and real
experiments show the parameter estimation accuracy and model validation for
different nonlinear structural systems.

Main category: q-bio.CB

TL;DR: scMamba is a foundation model enabling integrated single-cell multi-omics analysis without feature selection, preserving genomic position and improving biological insights across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in integrating multimodal single-cell data which often loses crucial biological information during preprocessing steps.

Method: scMamba uses a patch-based cell tokenization to treat genomic regions as tokens and cells as sentences, paired with a novel contrastive learning approach with cosine similarity regularization.

Result: scMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological variation, aligning omics layers, and downstream tasks like clustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference.

Conclusion: scMamba enables large-scale single-cell multi-omics integration, advancing biological discovery and bridging gaps in cellular analysis methodologies.

Abstract: The advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies has enabled the
simultaneous profiling of diverse omics layers within individual cells.
Integrating such multimodal data provides unprecedented insights into cellular
identity, regulatory processes, and disease mechanisms. However, it remains
challenging, as current methods often rely on selecting highly variable genes
or peaks during preprocessing, which may inadvertently discard crucial
biological information. Here, we present scMamba, a foundation model designed
to integrate single-cell multi-omics data without the need for prior feature
selection while preserving genomic positional information. scMamba introduces a
patch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomics regions as words
(tokens) and cells as sentences. Building upon the concept of state space
duality, scMamba distills rich biological insights from high-dimensional,
sparse single-cell multi-omics data. Additionally, our novel contrastive
learning approach, enhanced with cosine similarity regularization, enables
superior alignment across omics layers compared to traditional methods.
Systematic benchmarking across multiple datasets demonstrates that scMamba
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological
variation, aligning omics layers, and enhancing key downstream tasks such as
clustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference. Our findings
position scMamba as a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics
integration, capable of handling large-scale atlases and advancing biological
discovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RASH, a novel framework addressing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs by leveraging dual heterogeneous hypergraphs and a contrastive learning approach. Extensive experiments show its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While node heterophily has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs, it remains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs where multiple node and edge types exist, posing challenges in preserving both heterogeneity and heterophily.

Method: The study proposes RASH, utilizing dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite subgraphs, dynamically constructing homophilic and heterophilic graphs, and maximizing mutual information through a multi-relation contrastive loss.

Result: RASH demonstrates strong performance across various downstream tasks in experiments on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: RASH effectively addresses heterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs, showcasing its ability to capture complex interactions and outperform traditional methods.

Abstract: Real-world networks usually have a property of node heterophily, that is, the
connected nodes usually have different features or different labels. This
heterophily issue has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs but
remains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs, where there are multiple types
of nodes and edges. Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very
challenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be
carefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert
heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which
will inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous
relations. To bridge this gap, we propose Relation-Aware Separation of
Homophily and Heterophily (RASH), a novel contrastive learning framework that
explicitly models high-order semantics of heterogeneous interactions and
adaptively separates homophilic and heterophilic patterns. Particularly, RASH
introduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite
subgraphs and dynamically constructs homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs
based on relation importance. A multi-relation contrastive loss is designed to
align heterogeneous and homophilic/heterophilic views by maximizing mutual
information. In this way, RASH simultaneously resolves the challenges of
heterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RASH across various
downstream tasks. The code is available at:

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new class of weighted deep polynomial approximations tailored for functions with asymmetric behavior, offering better performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional polynomial approximations for non-smooth or singular functions, where standard methods fail to capture both local and global behaviors effectively.

Method: The authors introduce weighted deep polynomial approximants combined with asymmetric, learnable weights and propose a stable, graph-based parameterization strategy for optimization.

Result: Numerically, these weighted deep polynomials outperform Taylor, Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial methods while using the same parameter count.

Conclusion: Weighted deep polynomial approximants offer superior efficiency and accuracy for challenging functions, providing an effective alternative to traditional polynomial approximation techniques.

Abstract: It is a classical result in rational approximation theory that certain
non-smooth or singular functions, such as $|x|$ and $x^{1/p}$, can be
efficiently approximated using rational functions with root-exponential
convergence in terms of degrees of freedom \cite{Sta, GN}. In contrast,
polynomial approximations admit only algebraic convergence by Jackson's theorem
\cite{Lub2}. Recent work shows that composite polynomial architectures can
recover exponential approximation rates even without smoothness \cite{KY}. In
this work, we introduce and analyze a class of weighted deep polynomial
approximants tailored for functions with asymmetric behavior-growing unbounded
on one side and decaying on the other. By multiplying a learnable deep
polynomial with a one-sided weight, we capture both local non-smoothness and
global growth. We show numerically that this framework outperforms Taylor,
Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial approximants, even when all use the
same number of parameters. To optimize these approximants in practice, we
propose a stable graph-based parameterization strategy building on \cite{Jar}.

Motivation: To enhance the prediction accuracy and reliability of mechanical properties and to integrate uncertainty quantification into structural material design and modeling.

Method: A Mixed Density Network model trained on experimental data predicts dislocation density distributions and their statistical parameters, which are integrated into a dislocation-mediated plasticity model.

Result: The approach accurately predicts stress-strain behaviors with quantified uncertainties, proving valuable for material property estimation and optimization.

Conclusion: The method improves mechanical property predictions, aids alloy design, and contributes to the development of new materials in an evolving industrial landscape.

Abstract: Machine learning has significantly advanced the understanding and application
of structural materials, with an increasing emphasis on integrating existing
data and quantifying uncertainties in predictive modeling. This study presents
a comprehensive methodology utilizing a mixed density network (MDN) model,
trained on extensive experimental data from literature. This approach uniquely
predicts the distribution of dislocation density, inferred as a latent
variable, and the resulting stress distribution at the grain level. The
incorporation of statistical parameters of those predicted distributions into a
dislocation-mediated plasticity model allows for accurate stress-strain
predictions with explicit uncertainty quantification. This strategy not only
improves the accuracy and reliability of mechanical property predictions but
also plays a vital role in optimizing alloy design, thereby facilitating the
development of new materials in a rapidly evolving industry.

TL;DR: This paper compares Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in rainfall-runoff modeling across various datasets and catchments. The study finds TFT slightly superior, particularly in capturing hydrograph peaks and longer sequences, while identifying key variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the differences in performance and insights provided by Temporal Fusion Transformers and LSTM networks in hydrological modeling.

Method: The study trains ten models each of TFT and LSTM using datasets from 531 CAMELS catchments in the US and subsets from the Caravan dataset (representing five regions). Performance metrics and variability regarding catchment attributes are analyzed.

Result: TFT slightly outperforms LSTM, especially in simulating midsections and peaks of hydrographs. TFT handles longer sequences better and identifies crucial dynamic/static variables. Performance drops for both models on the Caravan dataset due to data quality concerns.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the TFT's potential for enhancing hydrological modeling, particularly in handling large catchments and producing explainable AI insights. Data quality remains an area to address.

Abstract: Combining attention with recurrence has shown to be valuable in sequence
modeling, including hydrological predictions. Here, we explore the strength of
Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) over Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
in rainfall-runoff modeling. We train ten randomly initialized models, TFT and
LSTM, for 531 CAMELS catchments in the US. We repeat the experiment with five
subsets of the Caravan dataset, each representing catchments in the US,
Australia, Brazil, Great Britain, and Chile. Then, the performance of the
models, their variability regarding the catchment attributes, and the
difference according to the datasets are assessed. Our findings show that TFT
slightly outperforms LSTM, especially in simulating the midsection and peak of
hydrographs. Furthermore, we show the ability of TFT to handle longer sequences
and why it can be a better candidate for higher or larger catchments. Being an
explainable AI technique, TFT identifies the key dynamic and static variables,
providing valuable scientific insights. However, both TFT and LSTM exhibit a
considerable drop in performance with the Caravan dataset, indicating possible
data quality issues. Overall, the study highlights the potential of TFT in
improving hydrological modeling and understanding.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRAGON, a framework for fine-tuning generative models using versatile reward functions capable of evaluating individual examples, distributions, or cross-modal data. It outperforms traditional RLHF and achieves high human-perceived quality without human preference annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models are limited in their ability to fine-tune for diverse reward types, particularly cross-modal or distribution-based objectives. There is a need for a more flexible and robust optimization framework to improve model outputs.

Method: DRAGON employs a flexible approach by constructing reward functions using encoders and reference exemplar distributions. It generates on-policy examples, scores them to form positive and negative sets, and contrasts these to optimize rewards using fine-tuning.

Result: DRAGON demonstrated an 81.45% average win rate across 20 reward functions and achieved a 60.95% human-voted win rate for music quality. It performs well in settings involving cross-modal, instance-to-distribution, and other complex rewards.

Conclusion: DRAGON showcases a novel way of designing reward functions that enhance generative model outputs effectively. It achieves strong results without relying on explicit human preference annotations, paving the way for flexible and versatile optimizations in media generation.

Abstract: We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a
versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired
outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization
(DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate
either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with
a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and
distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct
novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples
to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP
are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text
versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores
them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and
leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For
evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20
different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP
score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare
instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple
FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an
81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets
indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an
appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality
win rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON
exhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for
improving human-perceived quality. Sound examples at

TL;DR: The paper examines adapter-based Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques for music generation models, comparing their performance in low-resource music genres.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of high computational expense in fine-tuning large-scale music generation models by exploring more efficient PEFT techniques.

Method: Various adapter configurations were tested on MusicGen and Mustango models for Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music to analyze performance trade-offs based on architecture, size, and placement.

Result: Convolution-based adapters perform well on local details, while transformer-based adapters are better for long-range dependencies. Mid-sized adapters strike a quality-performance balance. Mustango is more diverse but less stable, while MusicGen is faster and efficient with slightly redundant output.

Conclusion: Adapter-based fine-tuning is a viable approach for achieving efficient and quality outputs in music generation, with trade-offs depending on adapter types and model architectures.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and
Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to
billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based
methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with
minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the
design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,
are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce
optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this
paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter
configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:
Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in
capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short
melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range
dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze
computational resource requirements across different adapter scales,
demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal
balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a
diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to
the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in
notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive
and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive
models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can
produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher
redundancy in their generations.

Method: Utilizes strategies to integrate hierarchical structures into models for instrument activity detection, based on the Hornbostel-Sachs classification and tested using the MedleyDB dataset.

Result: Demonstrates that hierarchical classification enhances coarse-level instrument detection in orchestral music, especially with limited fine-grained data.

Conclusion: Bridging detailed instrument recognition with group-level detection leads to more reliable and advanced methods for instrument activity detection in music information retrieval.

Abstract: Identifying instrument activities within audio excerpts is vital in music
information retrieval, with significant implications for music cataloging and
discovery. Prior deep learning endeavors in musical instrument recognition have
predominantly emphasized instrument classes with ample data availability.
Recent studies have demonstrated the applicability of hierarchical
classification in detecting instrument activities in orchestral music, even
with limited fine-grained annotations at the instrument level. Based on the
Hornbostel-Sachs classification, such a hierarchical classification system is
evaluated using the MedleyDB dataset, renowned for its diversity and richness
concerning various instruments and music genres. This work presents various
strategies to integrate hierarchical structures into models and tests a new
class of models for hierarchical music prediction. This study showcases more
reliable coarse-level instrument detection by bridging the gap between detailed
instrument identification and group-level recognition, paving the way for
further advancements in this domain.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a public acoustic dataset (SZUR-Acoustic Dataset) and a deep learning model (BMCNN) achieving high accuracy in vehicular noise classification, with applications in smart-city traffic management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to advance acoustic-based vehicular speed estimation to improve urban traffic control, monitor noise pollution, and support sustainable city planning.

Method: The study introduces BMCNN, a bimodal deep learning model that fuses MFCCs and wavelet-packet energy features via cross-modal attention. Preprocessing involves adaptive denoising and normalization.

Result: BMCNN achieved 87.56% accuracy on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the IDMT-Traffic dataset, with additional tests validating its robustness and anti-overfitting capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances real-time traffic flow management and noise monitoring, offering notable benefits to urban planning and smart-city systems.

Abstract: This study presents and publicly releases the Suzhou Urban Road Acoustic
Dataset (SZUR-Acoustic Dataset), which is accompanied by comprehensive
data-acquisition protocols and annotation guidelines to ensure transparency and
reproducibility of the experimental workflow. To model the coupling between
vehicular noise and driving speed, we propose a bimodal-feature-fusion deep
convolutional neural network (BMCNN). During preprocessing, an adaptive
denoising and normalization strategy is applied to suppress environmental
background interference; in the network architecture, parallel branches extract
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and wavelet-packet energy features,
which are subsequently fused via a cross-modal attention mechanism in the
intermediate feature space to fully exploit time-frequency information.
Experimental results demonstrate that BMCNN achieves a classification accuracy
of 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic
dataset. Ablation studies and robustness tests on the Suzhou dataset further
validate the contributions of each module to performance improvement and
overfitting mitigation. The proposed acoustics-based speed classification
method can be integrated into smart-city traffic management systems for
real-time noise monitoring and speed estimation, thereby optimizing traffic
flow control, reducing roadside noise pollution, and supporting sustainable
urban planning.

*Kehan Sui,Jinxu Xiang,Fang Jin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SmoothSinger, a conditional diffusion model for high-quality singing voice synthesis without vocoders, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current singing voice synthesis methods struggle with naturalness and quality due to artifacts and limitations in existing vocoder-dependent pipelines.

Method: SmoothSinger uses a conditional diffusion approach with a reference-guided dual-branch architecture and a parallel low-frequency upsampling path for improved pitch and spectral dependency modeling.

Result: Experiments on the Opencpop dataset show that SmoothSinger outperforms existing methods objectively and subjectively, with fewer artifacts and greater naturalness.

Conclusion: SmoothSinger effectively refines low-quality synthesized audio in a unified framework, demonstrating its potential as a state-of-the-art method for singing voice synthesis.

Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive and high-quality
vocals from musical scores, requiring precise modeling of pitch, duration, and
articulation. While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in
image and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to
the complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in
artifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a
conditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural
singing voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage
and often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized
audio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated
with two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch
architecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference
to guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware
synthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel
low-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch
contours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during
training, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio,
addressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals. Experiments
on the Opencpop dataset, a large-scale Chinese singing corpus, demonstrate that
SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective
evaluations. Extensive ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing
artifacts and improving the naturalness of synthesized voices.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable formulation of the STFT for optimizing its parameters via gradient-based methods to enhance signal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for tuning STFT parameters are inefficient and yield suboptimal results, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: A unified differentiable formulation of STFT is proposed, which relies on gradient-based optimization and allows integration with neural networks.

Result: The experiments demonstrate improved time-frequency representations and enhanced performance in downstream tasks using both simulated and real-world data.

Conclusion: The differentiable STFT effectively enhances signal analysis and opens avenues for efficient parameter tuning and integration with data-driven models.

Abstract: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is widely used for analyzing
non-stationary signals. However, its performance is highly sensitive to its
parameters, and manual or heuristic tuning often yields suboptimal results. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a unified differentiable formulation of
the STFT that enables gradient-based optimization of its parameters. This
approach addresses the limitations of traditional STFT parameter tuning
methods, which often rely on computationally intensive discrete searches. It
enables fine-tuning of the time-frequency representation (TFR) based on any
desired criterion. Moreover, our approach integrates seamlessly with neural
networks, allowing joint optimization of the STFT parameters and network
weights. The efficacy of the proposed differentiable STFT in enhancing TFRs and
improving performance in downstream tasks is demonstrated through experiments
on both simulated and real-world data.

TL;DR: EraRAG is a dynamic and scalable Graph-RAG framework using Locality-Sensitive Hashing for efficient updates to evolving corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph-RAG approaches struggle with scalability due to the need for expensive recomputation when adding new documents.

Method: EraRAG organizes an external corpus into hierarchical graph structures using hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing, enabling efficient updates without retraining.

Result: EraRAG reduces update time and token consumption significantly while maintaining high retrieval accuracy, outperforming traditional Graph-RAG systems.

Conclusion: EraRAG bridges the gap between adaptability and efficiency in retrieval-augmented systems for evolving corpora, providing a practical and scalable solution.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) enhances large
language models (LLMs) by structuring retrieval over an external corpus.
However, existing approaches typically assume a static corpus, requiring
expensive full-graph reconstruction whenever new documents arrive, limiting
their scalability in dynamic, evolving environments. To address these
limitations, we introduce EraRAG, a novel multi-layered Graph-RAG framework
that supports efficient and scalable dynamic updates. Our method leverages
hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to partition and organize the
original corpus into hierarchical graph structures, enabling efficient and
localized insertions of new data without disrupting the existing topology. The
design eliminates the need for retraining or costly recomputation while
preserving high retrieval accuracy and low latency. Experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that EraRag achieves up to an order of magnitude
reduction in update time and token consumption compared to existing Graph-RAG
systems, while providing superior accuracy performance. This work offers a
practical path forward for RAG systems that must operate over continually
growing corpora, bridging the gap between retrieval efficiency and
adaptability. Our code and data are available at

*Matthew Zurek,Yudong Chen*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving value-iteration algorithms for solving multichain Markov decision processes under the average-reward criterion to improve convergence rates and complexity measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of solving Markov decision processes in the multichain average-reward setting, particularly the demanding navigation subproblem and the inherent difficulties of non-contractivity and non-uniqueness.

Method: The authors develop algorithms that improve the navigational subproblem in multichain MDPs, leveraging connections between average-reward and discounted problems, fixed-point methods, and introducing new sublinear convergence rates.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve faster convergence rates and provide sharper complexity measures for solving average-reward and discounted MDP problems. They also introduce methodologies of independent theoretical interest.

Conclusion: The work advances the theoretical understanding of VI algorithms in MDPs and provides practical improvements for addressing the challenging multichain average-reward setting.

Abstract: We study value-iteration (VI) algorithms for solving general (a.k.a.
multichain) Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the average-reward
criterion, a fundamental but theoretically challenging setting. Beyond the
difficulties inherent to all average-reward problems posed by the lack of
contractivity and non-uniqueness of solutions to the Bellman operator, in the
multichain setting an optimal policy must solve the navigation subproblem of
steering towards the best connected component, in addition to optimizing
long-run performance within each component. We develop algorithms which better
solve this navigational subproblem in order to achieve faster convergence for
multichain MDPs, obtaining improved rates of convergence and sharper measures
of complexity relative to prior work. Many key components of our results are of
potential independent interest, including novel connections between
average-reward and discounted problems, optimal fixed-point methods for
discounted VI which extend to general Banach spaces, new sublinear convergence
rates for the discounted value error, and refined suboptimality decompositions
for multichain MDPs. Overall our results yield faster convergence rates for
discounted and average-reward problems and expand the theoretical foundations
of VI approaches.

*Alain Bensoussan,Minh-Binh Tran,Bangjie Wang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper explores control and optimization of coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic operators, framing neural networks as PDE-based control systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored problem of controlling and optimizing coefficients in the operators of parabolic and hyperbolic systems, crucial for understanding neural networks in supervised learning.

Method: The authors propose a novel dual system formulation for parabolic PDE control problems, theoretical proofs for minimizers, and an investigation into approximated control solutions for hyperbolic PDEs.

Result: They prove the existence of minimizers for parabolic PDE control problems and provide solutions for approximated hyperbolic PDE control problems.

Conclusion: The paper lays the foundational framework for future research in the control theory of PDEs applied to neural networks and demonstrates feasibility through theoretical proofs.

Abstract: Although there is a substantial body of literature on control and
optimization problems for parabolic and hyperbolic systems, the specific
problem of controlling and optimizing the coefficients of the associated
operators within such systems has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
work, we aim to initiate a line of research in control theory focused on
optimizing and controlling the coefficients of these operators-a problem that
naturally arises in the context of neural networks and supervised learning.
  In supervised learning, the primary objective is to transport initial data
toward target data through the layers of a neural network. We propose a novel
perspective: neural networks can be interpreted as partial differential
equations (PDEs). From this viewpoint, the control problem traditionally
studied in the context of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is
reformulated as a control problem for PDEs, specifically targeting the
optimization and control of coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic operators.
To the best of our knowledge, this specific problem has not yet been
systematically addressed in the control theory of PDEs.
  To this end, we propose a dual system formulation for the control and
optimization problem associated with parabolic PDEs, laying the groundwork for
the development of efficient numerical schemes in future research. We also
provide a theoretical proof showing that the control and optimization problem
for parabolic PDEs admits minimizers. Finally, we investigate the control
problem associated with hyperbolic PDEs and prove the existence of solutions
for a corresponding approximated control problem.

### [359] [IMC-PINN-FE: A Physics-Informed Neural Network for Patient-Specific Left Ventricular Finite Element Modeling with Image Motion Consistency and Biomechanical Parameter Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20696)
*Siyu Mu,Wei Xuan Chan,Choon Hwai Yap*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents IMC-PINN-FE, a physics-informed neural network framework, that enhances the accuracy and efficiency of left ventricular biomechanical modeling using patient-specific cardiac imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately understanding myocardial biomechanical behavior is essential for cardiac physiology but requires methods better than conventional finite element analysis, which is slow and often inaccurate.

Method: The proposed IMC-PINN-FE combines motion consistency derived from cardiac imaging with a physics-guided neural network framework and finite element modeling to estimate myocardial stiffness and tension rapidly.

Result: IMC-PINN-FE accelerates finite element computation by 75x, improving displacement alignment (Dice score from 0.849 to 0.927) and maintaining pressure-volume accuracy using single-subject motion data.

Conclusion: IMC-PINN-FE enables efficient, personalized, image-consistent cardiac modeling without relying on extensive datasets and advances motion fidelity and material property estimation.

Abstract: Elucidating the biomechanical behavior of the myocardium is crucial for
understanding cardiac physiology, but cannot be directly inferred from clinical
imaging and typically requires finite element (FE) simulations. However,
conventional FE methods are computationally expensive and often fail to
reproduce observed cardiac motions. We propose IMC-PINN-FE, a physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework that integrates imaged motion consistency (IMC)
with FE modeling for patient-specific left ventricular (LV) biomechanics.
Cardiac motion is first estimated from MRI or echocardiography using either a
pre-trained attention-based network or an unsupervised cyclic-regularized
network, followed by extraction of motion modes. IMC-PINN-FE then rapidly
estimates myocardial stiffness and active tension by fitting clinical pressure
measurements, accelerating computation from hours to seconds compared to
traditional inverse FE. Based on these parameters, it performs FE modeling
across the cardiac cycle at 75x speedup. Through motion constraints, it matches
imaged displacements more accurately, improving average Dice from 0.849 to
0.927, while preserving realistic pressure-volume behavior. IMC-PINN-FE
advances previous PINN-FE models by introducing back-computation of material
properties and better motion fidelity. Using motion from a single subject to
reconstruct shape modes also avoids the need for large datasets and improves
patient specificity. IMC-PINN-FE offers a robust and efficient approach for
rapid, personalized, and image-consistent cardiac biomechanical modeling.
