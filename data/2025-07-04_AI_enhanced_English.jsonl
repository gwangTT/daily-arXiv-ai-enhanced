On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes AIRES, a co-design solution improving out-of-core sparse matrix multiplications in GCNs, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency.", "motivation": "Existing out-of-core SpGEMM solutions for GCNs face challenges like high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization due to issues in sparse format data alignment and memory allocation.", "method": "AIRES introduces block-level data alignment and tiling algorithms for sparse matrices on the algorithm side, along with a three-phase dynamic scheduling mechanism featuring a dual-way data transfer strategy across GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage, and host memory.", "result": "AIRES achieves up to 1.8x lower latency compared to state-of-the-art methods in real-world graph benchmarks.", "conclusion": "AIRES effectively addresses the performance bottlenecks in out-of-core SpGEMM for GCNs, offering a significant improvement in speed and efficiency."}}
