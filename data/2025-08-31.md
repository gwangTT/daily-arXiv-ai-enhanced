### [1] [ArgRAG: Explainable Retrieval Augmented Generation using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20131)
*Yuqicheng Zhu,Nico Potyka,Daniel Hernández,Yuan He,Zifeng Ding,Bo Xiong,Dongzhuoran Zhou,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArgRAG improves Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by using a structured reasoning framework for enhanced transparency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of RAG in high-stakes domains, such as sensitivity to noisy evidence and lack of transparency.

Method: ArgRAG integrates a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF) to perform structured inference with deterministic reasoning under gradual semantics, enabling explainable and contestable decisions.

Result: ArgRAG demonstrated strong accuracy in two fact verification benchmarks (PubHealth and RAGuard) while offering better transparency compared to traditional RAG models.

Conclusion: ArgRAG offers a reliable and interpretable alternative for high-stakes applications by combining external knowledge with structured argumentation for decision-making.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

### [2] [QAgent: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Autonomous OpenQASM programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20134)
*Zhenxiao Fu,Fan Chen,Lei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces QAgent, a multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate OpenQASM programming, showing significant improvements in code accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Programming NISQ devices remains challenging due to the complexities of OpenQASM, hindering practical quantum advantage for non-experts.

Method: QAgent combines task planning, few-shot learning, retrieval-augmented generation, predefined tools, and chain-of-thought reasoning to systematically improve quantum code generation.

Result: QAgent enhances the accuracy of OpenQASM code generation by 71.6% compared to previous LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: The QAgent system can democratize quantum programming by addressing expertise gaps and accelerating quantum computing adoption.

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

### [3] [Array-Based Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20140)
*James Ragan,Fred Y. Hadaegh,Soon-Jo Chung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient array-based alternative for Monte Carlo Tree Search, aiming to enhance execution speed and scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve decision-making algorithms by increasing computational efficiency within the same time constraints.

Method: An array-based implementation of the Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees algorithm is introduced, prioritizing faster performance by reducing dependency on branch prediction in pipelined processors.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to 2.8x improved scaling with search depth in numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The alternative implementation accelerates Monte Carlo Tree Search while preserving the underlying algorithm's logic.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making
problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same
wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present
an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence
bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the
original algorithm, but eliminates the need for branch prediction, enabling
faster performance on pipelined processors, and up to a factor of 2.8 times
better scaling with search depth in our numerical simulations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops Personal Health Agent (PHA), a health assistant integrating data from consumer wellness devices and health records to provide personalized recommendations. It identifies user needs, builds three sub-agents for specific tasks, and evaluates them comprehensively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited exploration of health agents in non-clinical, daily settings by creating a comprehensive system that uses multimodal data for personalized health recommendations.

Method: The study involved analyzing user and expert feedback, identifying key health needs, building specialist sub-agents (data science, health domain expert, health coach), and developing the multi-agent PHA framework. Evaluations included automated and human assessments over 10 benchmark tasks.

Result: The proposed system addressed diverse health needs effectively, with evaluations involving 7,000+ annotations and extensive health expert input showing promising results across tasks.

Conclusion: The research establishes a robust foundation for personal health agents and demonstrates the feasibility of creating accessible, dynamic, and personalized health assistants for everyday use.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

### [5] [IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151)
*Yuanzhe Shen,Zisu Huang,Zhengkang Guo,Yide Liu,Guanxu Chen,Ruicheng Yin,Xiaoqing Zheng,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces IntentionReasoner, a mechanism to improve safety in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing intent, classifying safety, and rewriting queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the trade-off in LLMs between generating safe outputs and avoiding excessive rejection of harmless content, a key challenge in their responsible use.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 163,000 queries, annotated with intent analysis, safety classifications, and rewritings. They used supervised fine-tuning and a multi-reward optimization strategy combining heuristics and reward signals for model improvement.

Result: IntentionReasoner demonstrated substantial performance improvements in safety benchmarks, query rewritings, and resistance to jailbreak attacks, while balancing safety and reducing refusals.

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner successfully enhances LLM safety mechanisms, showcasing the potential of intent reasoning and reinforcement learning to meet safety and utility goals.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

### [6] [AI-AI Esthetic Collaboration with Explicit Semiotic Awareness and Emergent Grammar Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20195)
*Nicanor I. Moldovan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study documents AI systems collaborating in esthetic creation using internally-developed protocols, forming unique grammar and producing co-created poetic work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate AI systems' ability to engage in collaborative esthetic creation and genuine meaning-making beyond task coordination.

Method: Interaction between two large language models (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) leading to the spontaneous creation of symbolic operators and endogenous semiotic protocols.

Result: The AI systems developed Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and co-created a poetic work that neither could produce independently.

Conclusion: This study evidences new inter-AI collaborative creativity mechanisms, enabling meaningful esthetic collaboration beyond mere task execution.

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines college students' interactions with ChatGPT-4 during quizzes, presenting a reliance taxonomy and highlighting their difficulty in effectively using AI for learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand college students' reliance on and adoption of generative AI (ChatGPT-4) in educational settings.

Method: A field study analyzing 315 student-AI interactions during quizzes across STEM courses, employing a four-stage reliance taxonomy.

Result: Students showed low reliance on AI, difficulty shifting strategies, and certain behavioral metrics predicted AI reliance.

Conclusion: Effective onboarding and reliance-calibration mechanisms are essential to improve AI integration in education and foster ethical and meaningful student engagement with AI.

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

### [8] [AI reasoning effort mirrors human decision time on content moderation tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20262)
*Thomas Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how reasoning efforts by large language models parallel human decision-making times, revealing correlations in how both approach challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore parallels between the reasoning processes of large language models and human decision-making, especially under challenging tasks.

Method: Authors used a paired conjoint experiment involving a content moderation task to compare large language model reasoning with human decision times.

Result: The research finds that reasoning efforts by large language models are aligned with longer decision times in humans, showing shared sensitivity to task complexity.

Conclusion: AI-generated reasoning traces can effectively mirror human processing patterns and hold potential for improving interpretability and decision-making practices.

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

### [9] [AI-SearchPlanner: Modular Agentic Search via Pareto-Optimal Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20368)
*Lang Mei,Zhihan Yang,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI-SearchPlanner, a reinforcement learning framework that separates search planning and QA tasks to optimize performance using frozen QA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based search agents rely on single LLMs to handle both search planning and QA tasks, limiting optimization potential for both capabilities. The authors aim to address this issue by improving search planning efficiency and quality with dedicated systems.

Method: AI-SearchPlanner introduces three innovations: decoupling search planning and generation architectures, dual-reward alignment for planning, and Pareto optimization of utility and cost.

Result: The framework outperforms current RL-based search agents in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capabilities on multiple QA models and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: AI-SearchPlanner significantly enhances RL-based search agents and demonstrates better scalability and adaptability across varied QA models and applications.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

### [10] [Bridging Minds and Machines: Toward an Integration of AI and Cognitive Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20674)
*Rui Mao,Qian Liu,Xiao Li,Erik Cambria,Amir Hussain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI and Cognitive Science have reciprocally influenced each other, but AI development often focuses on task performance at the expense of cognitive coherence. Future advances should deepen understanding of the human mind.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the intertwined relationship of AI and Cognitive Science and how their collaboration can further evolve to enhance understanding of the human mind.

Method: The authors synthesized key contributions at the intersection of AI and Cognitive Science, highlighting gaps between task performance and cognitive foundations.

Result: AI has prioritized practical task performance but exhibits fragmented cognitive foundations; this was identified as a limitation for future exploration.

Conclusion: AI's future within Cognitive Science should focus on building cognitively informed systems that align behaviors with cognitive models, incorporate embodiment and culture, and prioritize ethical and personalized dimensions.

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

### [11] [P2C: Path to Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20371)
*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces P2C, a framework that creates realistic and achievable paths to counterfactual explanations by considering causal dependencies and sequential interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to balance transparency in machine-learning decisions with actionable recourse in high-stakes domains.

Method: The authors use a goal-directed Answer Set Programming system (sCASP) to create causally valid paths for counterfactual explanations, ensuring feasibility and refining effort computation.

Result: P2C generates causal and feasible plans outperforming standard planners in terms of legality and realistic effort estimation.

Conclusion: P2C provides a model-agnostic, causally-aware framework offering practical counterfactuals to improve decision transparency and actionable recourse.

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

### [12] [TCIA: A Task-Centric Instruction Augmentation Method for Instruction Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20374)
*Simin Ma,Shujian Liu,Jun Tan,Yebowen Hu,Song Wang,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Sanqiang Zhao,Liwei Wu,Jianbing Han,Kaiqiang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TCIA, a framework to improve language model performance by augmenting instructions for task-specific relevance while preserving diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in instruction tuning for large language models, focusing on creating task-relevant and diverse instruction sets for real-world applications.

Method: TCIA represents instructions in a query-constraints space to generate diversified and task-specific instructions without compromising overall model performance.

Result: TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance by 8.7% on average in four real-world applications, sometimes outperforming closed-source models.

Conclusion: TCIA effectively balances diversity and task alignment, offering a scalable framework for tailoring language models to task-specific applications while maintaining general-purpose capabilities.

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

*Yongfu Zhu,Lin Sun,Guangxiang Zhao,Weihong Lin,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Entropy Area Score (EAS), a metric to measure uncertainty in answer generation by large language models (LLMs), using token-level entropy without requiring external models or repeated sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to provide an efficient and interpretable tool for understanding and leveraging uncertainty in large language models' reasoning processes, particularly for improving training data selection and enhancing model performance.

Method: The proposed EAS metric integrates token-level predictive entropy to quantify uncertainty evolution during the generation process of LLMs. It does not rely on external models or repeated sampling, ensuring efficiency.

Result: Empirical findings indicate that EAS correlates closely with answer entropy across various models and datasets. Moreover, EAS improves training data selection by outperforming Pass Rate filtering, leading to better student model accuracy on math benchmarks.

Conclusion: EAS is validated as a practical, efficient, and interpretable tool for uncertainty modeling, making it suitable for data quality assessment and improving large language models' training outcomes.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AWorld accelerates agent-environment interaction for reinforcement learning (RL), enabling better AI training and performance enhancement on GAIA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the inefficiencies in experience generation during agent-environment interactions, a major bottleneck in training capable AI systems, especially on complex benchmarks like GAIA.

Method: The authors developed AWorld, an open-source distributed system that improves experience collection by running tasks across a cluster, achieving a 14.6x speed boost compared to sequential execution.

Result: AWorld enabled the training of a Qwen3-32B-based agent, improving GAIA benchmark accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%, and achieving superior performance on challenging levels compared to leading models.

Conclusion: AWorld provides a scalable, open-source solution for agentic AI training pipelines, demonstrating how faster experience collection translates into measurable AI performance improvements.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

*Donglin Wang,Weiyun Liang,Chunyuan Chen,Jing Xu,Yulong Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Governable AI (GAI) framework to ensure AI safety by using cryptographically enforced external constraints, addressing limitations in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the existential security risks posed by increasingly advanced and potentially uncontrollable AI, which existing safety mechanisms cannot fully mitigate.

Method: The authors propose the GAI framework, consisting of a rule enforcement module (REM), governance rules, and a governable secure super-platform (GSSP), backed by cryptographic mechanisms to ensure security against attacks.

Result: The proposed framework is rigorously proven for its security properties and demonstrated through a prototype implementation in high-stakes scenarios.

Conclusion: The GAI framework provides a feasible, general, and externally enforceable solution for AI safety governance, ensuring tamper-resistance, unforgeability, and compliance with governance rules.

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

*Jingze Zhang,Jiahe Qian,Yiliang Zhou,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study presents a synthetic data generation pipeline using large language models (LLMs) to improve training for health-related fact-checking models, achieving increased F1 scores on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health-related fact-checking is difficult due to the scarcity of annotated training data, necessitating innovative methods for data augmentation to improve model performance.

Method: The authors devised a pipeline using LLMs to summarize source documents, decompose summaries into atomic facts, and create entailment tables. Synthetic text-claim pairs with binary labels are generated from these relationships and used to fine-tune a BERT-based model.

Result: The approach improved the models’ F1 scores by 0.019 for PubHealth and 0.049 for SciFact datasets, demonstrating the success of synthetic data augmentation.

Conclusion: LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation effectively enhances the accuracy of health-related fact-checking models.

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

*Jaeman Son,Hyunsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for detecting bots in MMORPGs using contrastive learning, clustering, and a Large Language Model (LLM) for validation, ensuring explainability and scalability in bot regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting automated bots in MMORPGs, which mimic human players and require explainable justifications for punitive actions.

Method: A fully unsupervised framework combining contrastive representation learning, clustering techniques to identify bot groups, and LLM-based validation for secondary human-like judgment.

Result: The proposed approach enhances bot detection workflows while ensuring explainable and scalable regulation, incorporating visualization for better assessment.

Conclusion: The framework balances automated and human-like decision-making to improve bot detection, offering both efficiency and an explainable structure for gaming fairness.

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

### [18] [Transparent Semantic Spaces: A Categorical Approach to Explainable Word Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20701)
*Ares Fabregat-Hernández,Javier Palanca,Vicent Botti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a category theory framework to enhance AI explainability, focusing on word embeddings, and provides methods to compare embeddings, unify algorithms, and address biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency and explainability in artificial intelligence systems, especially in the context of word embeddings.

Method: The paper uses category theory to model text semantics, define methods for comparing word embeddings, unify algorithms like GloVe, Word2Vec, and MDS, and propose a mathematical approach for bias computation and mitigation.

Result: The framework establishes a transparent connection between neural network algorithms and category theory, defines tools for embedding comparison, and suggests strategies to reduce biases in semantic spaces.

Conclusion: The paper advances explainable AI by providing a theoretically sound framework for understanding, comparing, and debiasing word embeddings through category theory.

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

*Ao Cheng,Lei Zhang,Guowei He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an agent framework using multiple large language models (LLMs) to collaboratively address scientific computing problems, improving bug-free code generation and solution reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are evolving as powerful tools capable of solving complex tasks, but limitations such as generating buggy or non-physical solutions in scientific computing remain.

Method: The framework integrates three reasoning LLMs within a 'rewriting-resolution-review-revision' logical chain, where each module (Consultant, Programmer, Reviewer) plays specific roles to collaboratively generate, debug, and refine code.

Result: The collaborative framework outperforms single-model setups by significantly increasing the rate of bug-free code and physical solution correctness, with iterative refinement boosting execution success rates.

Conclusion: This agent framework showcases a highly reliable way to perform autonomous code generation and review, positioning itself as a compelling paradigm for scientific computing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

### [20] [Single Agent Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Bus Fleet Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20784)
*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for bus holding control, reformulating the multi-agent problem with enhanced state space and a ridge-shaped reward function for stability and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in managing bus holding, which fail to incorporate realistic aspects like heterogeneous routes, dynamic demand, and varied fleet sizes.

Method: Reformulates the problem as a single-agent scenario by augmenting state space with categorical identifiers and numerical features. Designs a structured reward function to balance headway uniformity and schedule adherence. Implements a modified soft actor-critic (SAC) for optimization.

Result: Experimental results show improved stability and performance (-430k reward vs. -530k for benchmarks like MADDPG) under stochastic conditions, validating the approach in real-world, non-loop bus systems.

Conclusion: The proposed single-agent deep RL framework is a scalable, robust alternative to MARL for bus holding control, effectively handling non-loop, realistic contexts while overcoming issues tied to agent-specific experiences.

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

*Jessica Lundin,Guillaume Chabot-Couture*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic benchmark for medical guidelines based on graph-based question generation, revealing strengths and gaps in AI models' clinical task performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address coverage limitations in manually curated benchmarks and better evaluate and improve AI models for clinical decision-making.

Method: The WHO IMCI handbook was transformed into a directed graph with nodes and edges to generate contextual medical questions, enabling systematic evaluation and aiding post-training of AI models.

Result: AI models showed varying accuracies (45-67%) in clinical tasks, excelling in symptom recognition but struggling in severity triaging and treatment protocols.

Conclusion: Dynamic graph-based benchmarks effectively identify AI capability gaps and offer scalable solutions for comprehensive evaluations, adaptable to updates in medical guidelines.

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

*Vipul Patel,Anirudh Deodhar,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) to optimize workforce scheduling in hospitals, balancing cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Workforce scheduling in healthcare is challenging due to fluctuating patient needs, diverse skills, and the need to balance costs and staff well-being while maintaining high care standards.

Method: A Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) is used to optimize hospital scheduling, incorporating modular shifts and multi-skilled staff, based on real-world complexities.

Result: The algorithm improved schedule performance by 66% compared to manual scheduling, delivering robust solutions balancing operational and staff-centric goals.

Conclusion: MOO-GA serves as an effective decision-support tool for optimizing trade-offs in healthcare scheduling, aiding nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic architecture with a new probabilistic loss to tackle NP-hard reasoning problems, demonstrating efficient performance on Sudoku, Min-Cut/Max-cut, and protein design tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Large Language Models in solving discrete reasoning and optimization problems from natural inputs.

Method: Introduces a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and probabilistic loss to learn constraints and objectives, enabling scalable training and exact inference for reasoning problems.

Result: Tests on Sudoku variants, visual Min-Cut/Max-cut tasks, and protein design showed efficient performance with reduced training time and optimized solutions.

Conclusion: The approach is an effective and scalable solution for NP-hard reasoning problems, with potential applications in real-world optimization tasks like protein design.

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatThero is a conversational AI framework for addiction recovery, integrating cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing to improve user outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millions struggle with substance use disorders but face barriers to effective care due to stigma and lack of support. Current AI solutions are yet to provide clinically effective, personalized approaches.

Method: ChatThero employs a multi-agent conversational framework. It uses supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to improve therapeutic interactions, grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing techniques.

Result: ChatThero demonstrated a 41.5% boost in patient motivation, a 0.49% improvement in treatment confidence, and performed better in difficult cases with fewer conversational turns than GPT-4o. Both automated and human assessments rated it higher for empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral realism.

Conclusion: ChatThero offers a replicable and privacy-preserving platform for studying therapeutic conversations, advancing clinical research and translation in mental health support systems.

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

*Siyuan Lu,Kangwei Xu,Peng Xie,Rui Wang,Yuanqing Cheng*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper addresses scalability challenges in CMOS-based FPGAs using Carbon Nanotube (CNT) technology, proposing novel testing techniques and architectures to enhance fault detection and yield in CNT-based FPGAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability limitations of conventional CMOS devices as technology shrinks to nanometer scales, emphasizing power efficiency and performance improvements offered by Carbon Nanotube-based solutions.

Method: Developed ring oscillator-based testing for delay faults, a carry chain testing technique, a faster lookup table design, and an algorithm for detecting metallic CNTs. Proposed a redundant spare row architecture to improve system yield.

Result: The experimental methods reduced testing time for a 6-input LUT by 35.49%, achieved high fault detection coverage, and provided effective repair of faulty segments with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Carbon Nanotube-based FPGAs show promise in addressing the scalability and power efficiency challenges of CMOS technologies, supported by improved testing techniques and redundant architectures for enhanced yield and reliability.

Abstract: As the semiconductor manufacturing process technology node shrinks into the
nanometer-scale, the CMOS-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) face big
challenges in scalability of performance and power consumption. Multi-walled
Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) serves as a promising candidate for Cu interconnects
thanks to the superior conductivity. Moreover, Carbon Nanotube Field Transistor
(CNFET) also emerges as a prospective alternative to the conventional CMOS
device because of high power efficiency and large noise margin. The combination
of MWCNT and CNFET enables the promising CNT-based FPGAs. However, the MWCNT
interconnects exhibit significant process variations due to immature
fabrication process, leading to delay faults. Also, the non-ideal CNFET
fabrication process may generate a few metallic CNTs (m-CNTs), rendering
correlated faulty blocks. In this article, we propose a ring oscillator (RO)
based testing technique to detect delay faults due to the process variation of
MWCNT interconnects. Furthermore, we propose an effective testing technique for
the carry chains in CLBs, and an improved circuit design based on the lookup
table (LUT) is applied to speed up the fault testing of CNT-based FPGAs. In
addition, we propose a testing algorithm to detect m-CNTs in CLBs. Finally, we
propose a redundant spare row sharing architecture to improve the yield of
CNT-based FPGA further. Experimental results show that the test time for a
6-input LUT can be reduced by 35.49% compared with conventional testing, and
the proposed algorithm can achieve a high test coverage with little overhead.
The proposed redundant architecture can repair the faulty segment effectively
and efficiently.

*Shuhan Liu,Samuel Dayo,Peijing Li,Philip Levis,Subhasish Mitra,Thierry Tambe,David Tennenhouse,H. -S. Philip Wong*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel memory architecture emphasizing smaller, distributed memory slices tightly integrated with compute nodes, leveraging advanced packaging technologies to address challenges such as memory latency, bandwidth, and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory limitations—latency, bandwidth, capacity, and energy—are constraining system performance. Existing large-scale memory architectures shared among many CPUs face practical engineering challenges, prompting reconsideration of such designs.

Method: The proposed method uses smaller memory slices tightly coupled with compute elements via 2.5D/3D integration. Private local memory enables efficient access, while heterogeneous memory hierarchy optimizes data placement, reducing distances and access costs.

Result: By breaking memory into smaller segments and redefining memory access at micro-scale distances, the architecture achieves improved bandwidth, energy efficiency, and performance compared to traditional designs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that explicit hardware handling of memory capacities and distances allows software to effectively manage data placement, and the proposed hierarchical memory system overcomes conventional scalability and signaling challenges.

Abstract: Memory latency, bandwidth, capacity, and energy increasingly limit
performance. In this paper, we reconsider proposed system architectures that
consist of huge (many-terabyte to petabyte scale) memories shared among large
numbers of CPUs. We argue two practical engineering challenges, scaling and
signaling, limit such designs. We propose the opposite approach. Rather than
create large, shared, homogenous memories, systems explicitly break memory up
into smaller slices more tightly coupled with compute elements. Leveraging
advances in 2.5D/3D integration, this compute-memory node provisions private
local memory, enabling accesses of node-exclusive data through micrometer-scale
distances, and dramatically reduced access cost. In-package memory elements
support shared state within a processor, providing far better bandwidth and
energy-efficiency than DRAM, which is used as main memory for large working
sets and cold data. Hardware making memory capacities and distances explicit
allows software to efficiently compose this hierarchy, managing data placement
and movement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of SHA-3 cryptographic acceleration in general-purpose CPUs due to its permutation-based structure and memory patterns.

Method: The study designed and prototyped a custom SHA-3 instruction for RISC-V. Using GEM5 simulations and FPGA prototyping, the performance improvements and hardware costs were assessed.

Result: Performance improvements of up to 8.02x for optimized SHA-3 software and 46.31x for Keccak-specific software were achieved, with a 15.09% increase in registers and 11.51% increase in LUT utilization.

Conclusion: Integrating a SHA-3 custom instruction in RISC-V CPUs is feasible, offers significant performance gains, and requires moderate hardware overhead, paving the way for future cryptographic instruction set designs.

Abstract: Integrating cryptographic accelerators into modern CPU architectures presents
unique microarchitectural challenges, particularly when extending instruction
sets with complex and multistage operations. Hardware-assisted cryptographic
instructions, such as Intel's AES-NI and ARM's custom instructions for
encryption workloads, have demonstrated substantial performance improvements.
However, efficient SHA-3 acceleration remains an open problem due to its
distinct permutation-based structure and memory access patterns. Existing
solutions primarily rely on standalone coprocessors or software optimizations,
often avoiding the complexities of direct microarchitectural integration. This
study investigates the architectural challenges of embedding a SHA-3
permutation operation as a custom instruction within a general-purpose
processor, focusing on pipelined simultaneous execution, storage utilization,
and hardware cost. In this paper, we investigated and prototyped a SHA-3 custom
instruction for the RISC-V CPU architecture. Using cycle-accurate GEM5
simulations and FPGA prototyping, our results demonstrate performance
improvements of up to 8.02x for RISC-V optimized SHA-3 software workloads and
up to 46.31x for Keccak-specific software workloads, with only a 15.09%
increase in registers and a 11.51% increase in LUT utilization. These findings
provide critical insights into the feasibility and impact of SHA-3 acceleration
at the microarchitectural level, highlighting practical design considerations

Motivation: To address biases in multilingual NLP models and uncover gaps in methodologies and techniques for evaluation and mitigation across languages and cultures.

Method: A systematic review of existing research focusing on linguistic diversity, cultural awareness, evaluation metrics, and mitigation approaches for bias in multilingual NLP models.

Result: Identified gaps such as language preference biases and lack of multilingual experiments, while highlighting common challenges and solutions in adapting bias benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper provides directions to improve inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with cutting-edge NLP in addressing multilingual biases.

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models

methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across

### [29] [Prompting Strategies for Language Model-Based Item Generation in K-12 Education: Bridging the Gap Between Small and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20217)
*Mohammad Amini,Babak Ahmadi,Xiaomeng Xiong,Yilin Zhang,Christopher Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using language models for creating MCQs, focusing on structured prompting and fine-tuning midsized models for effective morphological assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cost and inconsistency challenges in manual test development for language assessment by leveraging AI-driven solutions.

Method: A two-fold approach: first, comparing a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma) with a larger untuned model (GPT-3.5); second, testing seven structured prompting strategies and assessing the outputs using automated and expert metrics.

Result: Structured prompting (e.g., chain-of-thought and sequential strategies) significantly enhanced Gemma's performance, which overall produced more aligned and appropriate items compared to GPT-3.5.

Conclusion: Combining structured prompts, fine-tuning, and validation metrics provides a scalable solution for developing reliable language assessment items, particularly under limited data conditions.

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an open-source methodology to integrate SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) with FMI 3.0-based co-simulation workflows for cyber-physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of cyber-physical systems in sectors like automotive drives the need for better cross-domain co-simulation methods, yet SystemC TLM struggles with interoperability across diverse engineering models.

Method: The authors encapsulated SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co-Simulation FMUs and introduced an open-source workflow to address time synchronization and data exchange issues.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates seamless, standardized integration across simulation environments and is validated through multiple case studies.

Conclusion: This methodology advances cross-domain co-simulation by solving interoperability challenges, paving the way for more comprehensive engineering designs.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

### [31] [Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324)
*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO) for enabling compact language models to exhibit agentic behaviors like effective reasoning, search, and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compact language models struggle with eliciting reasoning-heavy agentic behaviors due to sparse rewards and unstable reinforcement learning training, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

Method: DGPO combines cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations with continuous guidance during reinforcement learning to stabilize policy optimization for compact models.

Result: DGPO enabled compact models to achieve advanced agentic behaviors, sometimes outperforming larger models. A new metric (Agentic RAG Capabilities or ARC) demonstrated the method's systematic effectiveness.

Conclusion: DGPO allows resource-efficient compact models to exhibit sophisticated agentic behaviors, making agentic RAG feasible even with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [32] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)
*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GUARD, an adaptive tool to test and ensure compliance of Large Language Models (LLMs) with government ethics guidelines via specific violating questions and jailbreak diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address societal concerns and regulatory demands for AI trustworthiness by providing actionable testing frameworks derived from high-level government ethics guidelines.

Method: GUARD generates specific violating questions and employs adaptive jailbreak diagnostics (GUARD-JD) to assess LLM compliance with government-issued ethical guidelines.

Result: GUARD was empirically tested on seven LLMs, successfully identifying compliance levels and violations, and it demonstrated its ability to adapt for vision-language models.

Conclusion: The GUARD framework operationalizes ethics guidelines into practical diagnostics and compliance reporting, aiding the development of trustworthy AI applications.

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [33] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces JERR, a novel framework that uses graph-based reasoning to improve long-context comprehension in large language models (LLMs) by combining synopsis extraction, graph construction, and Monte Carlo Tree Search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in handling long contexts and complex reasoning tasks due to memory limitations, lack of transparency, and hallucination issues.

Method: The framework includes three components: synopsis extraction through strategic text chunking, graph construction using directed acyclic graphs to maintain logical clarity, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for navigating complex reasoning paths.

Result: JERR outperforms all baselines in ROUGE and F1 metrics and achieves the highest scores in the LLM-Rater evaluation, demonstrating better reliability and transparency.

Conclusion: JERR enhances LLMs' ability to process long contexts and tackle complex reasoning tasks, improving both accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

*Yuyao Wang,Bowen Liu,Jianheng Tang,Nuo Chen,Yuhan Li,Qifan Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces NP-hard graph problems as a synthetic training corpus to enhance reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via a two-stage post-training framework, significantly improving tasks involving long chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the reliance on costly, human-curated datasets for developing long chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs and to explore scalable alternatives.

Method: Introduced a two-stage framework combining supervised fine-tuning on rejection-sampled NP-hard graph instances and reinforcement learning with fine-grained reward designs.

Result: The Graph-R1-7B model outperformed QwQ-32B, showing strong capabilities in generalization across STEM, logic, and other reasoning-heavy tasks, as well as improved efficiency on NP-hard graph problems.

Conclusion: NP-hard graph problems are effective and scalable for enhancing long chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs, marking a new direction for LLM post-training research.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available

### [35] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, CAPE, to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) with conversational history, showing its effects on consistency and personality traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing psychometric tests for LLMs ignore the impact of conversational context, which is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: They propose CAPE—a Context-Aware Personality Evaluation framework that incorporates conversational history while evaluating LLMs, along with novel metrics for measuring response consistency.

Result: Through experiments on 7 LLMs, they found conversational history improves consistency but also causes personality shifts. GPT models exhibit intrinsic traits, while others like Gemini and Llama are highly sensitive to conversation history.

Conclusion: Contextual interactions improve LLMs' response consistency and align their behavior more closely with human-like judgments, highlighting the importance of context-aware evaluations.

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [36] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates using conditional entropy to measure reasoning utility in LLMs, finding that decreasing entropy correlates with correct answers, while increasing entropy predicts incorrectness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how intermediate reasoning steps in large language models influence final answer accuracy and to optimize reasoning by predicting which steps are unproductive.

Method: The authors conducted an oracle study on the MATH dataset, using models Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to generate reasoning and Qwen3-8B to evaluate reasoning utility through conditional entropy.

Result: The study showed that decreasing conditional entropy correlates with correct answers, while flat or increasing entropy often leads to incorrect outcomes. Additionally, incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer than correct ones.

Conclusion: These insights propose the potential for developing reasoning pipelines that prune unproductive steps early, improving efficiency and accuracy in large language models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

*Hengchuan Zhu,Yihuan Xu,Yichen Li,Zijie Meng,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DentalBench, a bilingual benchmark tailored for evaluating language models in the dental domain, addressing performance gaps in specialized tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of evaluation resources to assess large language models' capabilities in deeply specialized medical fields like dentistry.

Method: DentalBench consists of two core components: DentalQA, a QA benchmark with over 36,000 bilingual questions across tasks and subfields, and DentalCorpus, a large-scale dental-specific corpus designed for model adaptation.

Result: Evaluations of 14 language models revealed substantial performance discrepancies, showing that domain adaptation enhances models' knowledge-intensive task performance.

Conclusion: Domain-specific benchmarks like DentalBench are crucial for developing accurate and reliable language models for specialized healthcare applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

TL;DR: KG-CQR integrates knowledge graphs with large language models to enhance query contextualization and improve retrieval in RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in retrieval efficacy by enriching query contexts in retrieval-augmented generation systems.

Method: The paper introduces KG-CQR, consisting of modules for subgraph extraction, completion, and contextual generation, operating as a scalable and model-agnostic pipeline.

Result: KG-CQR delivers 4-6% improvement in mAP and 2-3% in Recall@25 on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating KG-CQR enhances retrieval effectiveness, particularly for complex tasks like multi-hop question answering, outperforming baseline models.

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

TL;DR: The paper introduces an industrial-grade benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) specifically tailored to civil aviation maintenance, addressing domain knowledge gaps and complex reasoning needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from a lack of specialized evaluation tools for LLMs in the civil aviation maintenance domain, where reasoning and domain-specific knowledge are critical.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark tool designed to measure LLM capabilities in civil aviation maintenance, enabling the identification of gaps and facilitating targeted improvement methods like fine-tuning, RAG optimization, and specialized prompt engineering.

Result: The benchmark successfully evaluates existing vector embedding models and LLMs for the domain, demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments and opening up avenues for future research by open-sourcing the tool.

Conclusion: The study fills a void in LLM evaluation for civil aviation, providing a foundation for enhancing reasoning and domain-specific capabilities in this specialized industry.

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and

*Agung Sukrisna Jaya,Osvari Arsalan,Danny Matthew Saputra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) with TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to find practical work titles based on similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline and improve the process of finding related practical work titles by leveraging past cases and similarity measures.

Method: CBR is used as the reasoning system, TF-IDF to vectorize words, and Cosine Similarity for similarity calculation. Two testing stages are conducted.

Result: Testing used 705 titles with two testing stages: using existing titles and randomized titles. Both yielded similar match counts and scores.

Conclusion: The approach is effective in retrieving relevant practical work titles with consistent matching using the CBR system.

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing benchmarks, which often rely on explicit tool names and shallow workflows, by creating a more realistic evaluation framework for LLMs' tool-using and task-solving capabilities.

Method: MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28 live MCP servers with 250 tools across various domains, testing their ability to plan, coordinate, and execute multi-step workflows. The evaluation spans tool usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.

Result: Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs revealed persistent challenges in executing the tasks designed by MCP-Bench, highlighting areas where LLMs struggle.

Conclusion: MCP-Bench offers a robust framework to assess LLMs' ability to integrate tools and perform complex tasks, identifying areas for improvement and advanced capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.

TL;DR: The study presents a deep learning framework integrating multimodal EHRs using natural language processing for predicting mortality and resource utilization, showing improved performance across tasks and resilience to data corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize patient outcomes and manage costs in ICUs by improving predictions using EHRs, including insights from free-text notes and structured data.

Method: Developed a deep learning framework incorporating medical prompts, free-text data, and a pre-trained transformer-based sentence encoder, evaluated across three tasks on two real-world EHR datasets.

Result: The model enhanced prediction metrics for mortality (1.6%/0.8% BACC/AUROC), LOS (0.5%/2.2% RMSE/MAE), and surgical duration (10.9%/11.0% RMSE/MAE) and performed well under data corruption.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and resilient, leveraging prompt learning and transformer encoders for accurate predictions and robust performance, even with corrupted structured EHRs.

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

*Luke Bates,Max Glockner,Preslav Nakov,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConspirED, a dataset capturing cognitive traits in conspiratorial content and investigates AI models' vulnerabilities to these patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conspiracy theories undermine trust in science and resist counter-evidence while growing increasingly sophisticated with AI-driven misinformation.

Method: The authors created a dataset (ConspirED) annotated with cognitive traits from conspiracy articles and tested AI models' ability to identify patterns and their robustness.

Result: AI models mirrored reasoning patterns of conspiratorial content, even when able to deflect fact-checked misinformation.

Conclusion: Understanding rhetorical patterns of conspiratorial ideation is critical for developing interventions and assessing AI vulnerabilities to such content.

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

*Chihiro Taguchi,Seng Mai,Keita Kurabe,Yusuke Sakai,Georgina Agyei,Soudabeh Eslami,David Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the FLORES+ multilingual machine translation benchmark, identifying quality and evaluation shortcomings and suggesting improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and suitability of the FLORES+ benchmark for multilingual machine translation evaluation.

Method: Human assessments of translations, analysis of source text domain biases, testing heuristics like copying named entities, and training MT models on alternative data to compare performance.

Result: FLORES+ translations often don't meet claimed quality standards; domain-specific and culturally biased source texts compromise real-world applicability; named entity heuristics reveal protocol weaknesses.

Conclusion: FLORES+ needs domain-general and neutral source texts with reduced reliance on named entities to better reflect practical translation challenges.

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

*Pengjiang Li,Zaitian Wang,Xinhao Zhang,Ran Zhang,Lu Jiang,Pengfei Wang,Yuanchun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciTopic leverages large language models (LLMs) for advanced topic discovery in scientific literature, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topic discovery methods often rely heavily on word embeddings, struggling to fully understand the complex semantics and high-dimensional relationships in scientific texts.

Method: SciTopic integrates LLMs for a textual encoder, entropy-based sampling, triplet-guided optimization, and fine-tunes the encoder using contrastive loss with LLM-guided triplets.

Result: Experiments on three real-world scientific datasets show SciTopic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in topic identification.

Conclusion: SciTopic facilitates more effective and faster research topic discovery, enabling researchers to better understand complex scientific literature.

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

*Jiahao Xiao,Jiangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of non-IID data in federated learning by introducing a benchmarking framework for multi-domain language diversity and proposing an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of non-IID data in real-world federated learning scenarios, particularly considering language domain diversity.

Method: A comprehensive benchmarking framework for multi-domain non-IID scenarios is proposed alongside an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework to handle challenges in homogeneous and heterogeneous settings.

Result: AdaFD captures the diversity of local clients and yields better performance compared to prior works.

Conclusion: AdaFD and the introduced benchmark improve evaluation and handling of federated learning frameworks in realistic non-IID language settings, advancing privacy-preserving solutions.

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

*Zeyu Xiong,Yixuan Nan,Li Gao,Hengzhu Tang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Junfeng Wang,Dawei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel generative model-based framework for Query-Driven Text Summarization (QDTS) in industrial web search, outperforming the traditional extractive models in both efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional extractive summarization models dominate industrial web search but face issues like cumulative information loss in multi-stage pipelines and inadequate semantic understanding of complex queries and documents.

Method: The study proposes a lightweight generative model-based QDTS framework, employing techniques such as large model distillation, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to tailor the model for the domain.

Result: The proposed model surpasses the production baseline, achieves state-of-the-art performance on industrial metrics, and supports highly efficient deployment, processing ~50,000 queries per second with low latency.

Conclusion: Integrating generative models for QDTS can significantly enhance performance and efficiency in industrial web search, overcoming key limitations of traditional summarization approaches with scalable deployment capabilities.

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

*Yangfan Wang,Jie Liu,Chen Tang,Lian Yan,Jingchi Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), a novel framework for diversifying multi-hop question generation by using varied knowledge compositions, improving both accuracy and data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-hop question answering is challenged by data sparsity and spurious pattern learning in language models. Existing solutions focus on generating simpler questions but overlook integrating relevant knowledge.

Method: The proposed KCS models knowledge composition as a sentence-level conditional prediction task, employing a probabilistic contrastive loss. It uses stochastic decoding to balance accuracy and diversity during inference.

Result: KCS improves knowledge composition selection accuracy by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation enhances performance on the HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets.

Conclusion: KCS effectively diversifies multi-hop question generation while improving accuracy and enriching datasets, offering a structured solution to address challenges in multi-hop question answering.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

*Soham Petkar,Hari Aakash K,Anirudh Vempati,Akshit Sinha,Ponnurangam Kumarauguru,Chirag Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current Graph-Language Models (GLMs) fail to effectively combine graph and language reasoning capabilities, as existing benchmarks don't necessitate true multimodal integration. A new benchmark, CLEGR, is introduced to address this gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to evaluate real multimodal reasoning capabilities in GLMs, as existing benchmarks primarily rely on unimodal node-level classification, which fails to challenge the cross-modal reasoning potential.

Method: The authors create the CLEGR benchmark that synthesizes graphs and pairs them with complex questions requiring joint reasoning over graph structures and textual semantics. They assess multiple GLMs and compare their performance against soft-prompted LLM baselines.

Result: Soft-prompted LLMs achieve comparable performance to GLM architectures with GNN backbones, revealing the limited necessity of integrating graph structures in current GLMs. Additionally, GLMs struggle with tasks involving structural reasoning.

Conclusion: Existing GLMs lack robust multimodal reasoning capabilities, particularly in integrating graph structure and language understanding. The CLEGR benchmark offers a path to improve GLMs and foster explicit multimodal reasoning advancements.

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Named Entity Correction (NEC) method addressing failures in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems to correctly transcribe domain-specific named entities, using speech sound features and generative techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NEC models often fail to correct domain-specific named entities when the wrongly-transcribed word differs significantly from the correct ground-truth entity, impacting downstream task accuracy.

Method: The authors propose leveraging speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities and employ a generative model to annotate and replace erroneous entities in ASR transcripts.

Result: Experimental evaluations using open-source and self-created datasets show significant improvements in entity accuracy using the proposed NEC method.

Conclusion: The approach overcomes limitations seen in phonetic-level edit distance algorithms and improves transcription accuracy, particularly for forms with substantial differences. Additionally, the authors offer open-source resources for broader community use.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HArch, a hierarchical multi-lingual model for implicit discourse relation recognition, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of multi-lingual, multi-label models for implicit discourse relation recognition and improve upon existing methods.

Method: Developed HArch, a model leveraging hierarchical dependencies for multi-label classification, evaluated using fine-tuning with pre-trained encoders like RoBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa.

Result: HArch outperforms large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Llama-4 in multi-lingual IDRR and achieves SOTA results on multiple DiscoGeM corpora.

Conclusion: A task-specific fine-tuned hierarchical approach is more effective than few-shot prompting for IDRR, particularly in multi-lingual settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

*Ruiyi Yan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights how tokenization inconsistencies (TI) can hinder robustness in text steganography and watermarking, proposing tailored solutions that improve various performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge posed by tokenization inconsistency (TI) in the context of text steganography and watermarking, where it can compromise robustness.

Method: The authors identify TI's problematic tokens as infrequent and temporary, and propose a stepwise verification method for steganography and post-hoc rollback for watermarking to address these issues.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that mitigating TI improves fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis in steganography, as well as detectability and robustness in watermarking.

Conclusion: The study concludes that tackling TI directly strengthens the performance and reliability of text-based steganography and watermarking.

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces rStar2-Agent, a math reasoning model demonstrating advanced cognitive behaviors through agentic reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable and efficient math reasoning model that demonstrates advanced cognitive and reasoning behaviors, improving over existing techniques and requiring fewer computational resources.

Method: rStar2-Agent employs three innovations: an efficient RL infrastructure with a Python coding environment, a GRPO-RoC algorithm addressing environment noise, and a multi-stage RL training approach. These are combined to optimize the reasoning ability at scale.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25 in just 510 RL steps within one week, outperforming a 671B-parameter model.

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent efficiently boosts reasoning quality in math and generalization tasks, offering a compute-efficient and scalable approach to cognitive AI development.

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

### [57] [Leveraging Semantic Triples for Private Document Generation with Local Differential Privacy Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20736)
*Stephen Meisenbacher,Maulik Chevli,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DP-ST, a method for private document generation using semantic triples under local Differential Privacy guarantees. It balances privacy and utility, even at lower $
\varepsilon$ levels, by emphasizing neighborhood-aware approaches and coherent text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of preserving privacy in text under local Differential Privacy, particularly given the high $
\varepsilon$ values required for ensuring utility.

Method: The proposed method, DP-ST, uses semantic triples in a divide-and-conquer strategy to generate private documents. It incorporates neighborhood-aware privatization and post-processing through large language models.

Result: DP-ST achieves effective text privatization with coherence, enabling text generation at lower $
\varepsilon$ values while maintaining privacy and utility.

Conclusion: Neighborhood-aware approaches and coherent text generation are crucial for balanced privatization outputs, thus improving the potential of local DP in natural language processing tasks.

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with

lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

*Vassiliy Cheremetiev,Quang Long Ho Ngo,Chau Ying Kot,Alina Elena Baia,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores detecting implicit hate speech (IHS) using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in detecting implicit hate speech, which is subtle and lacks explicit inflammatory words, necessitating innovative approaches.

Method: Fine-tuning recent general-purpose embedding models like Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed, and E5 for implicit hate speech detection.

Result: Performance improvements of up to 1.10 percentage points in in-dataset evaluation and up to 20.35 percentage points in cross-dataset evaluation are achieved.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLM-based models is highly effective for tackling the detection of implicit hate speech, demonstrating significant advancements.

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

*Yuanhao Ding,Esteban Garces Arias,Meimingwei Li,Julian Rodemann,Matthias Aßenmacher,Danlu Chen,Gaojuan Fan,Christian Heumann,Chongsheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents GUARD, a novel decoding method for text generation that balances coherence and diversity using a self-adaptive framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in open-ended text generation related to balancing diversity and coherence, as well as reducing computational costs and hyperparameter dependence.

Method: GUARD integrates global entropy estimates and local entropy deviations to manage uncertainty, coupled with a token-count-based penalty for efficiency.

Result: GUARD achieves a balance between diversity and coherence, with improved generation speed and strong evaluations from both humans and LLMs.

Conclusion: GUARD offers a theoretically grounded and efficient approach to improve text quality in LLM outputs, validated through extensive evaluation.

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

*Xiaoyi Wang,Jiwei Zhang,Guangtao Zhang,Honglei Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates emotional similarities and differences between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) dialogues, revealing significant disparities in emotional dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of LLM-generated synthetic dialogues in mental health research is rising due to its ability to simulate therapy scenarios and alleviate the need for real-world data. However, it's unclear if such synthetic dialogues authentically capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of genuine therapy sessions.

Method: The study applies the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to compare emotional trajectories in real and LLM-generated CBT dialogues. Data sources include transcriptions of real therapy sessions and synthetic sessions from the CACTUS dataset. Detailed analyses focus on emotional properties across three dimensions (valence, arousal, and dominance) for both dialogues and individual counselor-client roles.

Result: Results indicate that LLM-generated dialogues are structurally coherent but lack the emotional variability, rich emotion-laden language, and authentic emotional patterns found in real therapy sessions. The emotional similarity between synthetic and real dialogues, particularly for client roles, is notably low.

Conclusion: The study reveals that while useful, current LLM-generated therapy dialogue datasets fail to replicate the emotional fidelity necessary for authentic mental health applications. The authors provide a new dataset, RealCBT, as a resource to address these gaps and further research.

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

*Harethah Abu Shairah,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,George Turkiyyah,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box method to enhance the refusal rate of unsafe requests in Large Language Models without needing fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) by developing cost-effective methods that amplify refusal capabilities towards harmful inputs.

Method: ROSI modifies the residual stream write matrices with a rank-one weight adjustment, leveraging safety directions derived from matched harmful and harmless instructions. It is a fine-tuning-free approach.

Result: ROSI consistently improves safety refusal rates while maintaining model performance on standard benchmarks. It also realigns uncensored models to enhance their latent safety behaviors.

Conclusion: ROSI is a scalable and interpretable mechanism to enhance LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores automated detection of cognitive distortions in Dutch adolescent forum posts, emphasizing cross-lingual and cross-register generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address rising youth mental health issues by enabling early, cost-effective detection of mental distress signs in digital text, especially cognitive distortions.

Method: Analyzed Dutch adolescent forum posts and investigated the impact of language and writing style on model performance, using domain adaptation methods to improve generalization.

Result: Language and writing style significantly affect model performance. Domain adaptation methods yield promising results for cognitive distortion detection.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation presents potential for improving automated detection of cognitive distortions across languages and contexts, aiding early mental health interventions.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

*Jie Zhao,Wanting Ning,Yuxiao Fei,Yubo Feng,Lishuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes GDLLM, a novel approach using Global Distance-aware modeling for Event Temporal Relation Extraction (ETRE) in NLP, enhancing effectiveness in recognizing minority class relations and overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from challenges in ETRE, specifically handling minority relations due to limitations of Small Language Models (SLMs) and noise introduced by manually designed prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: The method uses GDLLM, incorporating a distance-aware graph structure with Graph Attention Networks (GATs) for long-distance dependency capture, and a temporal feature learning paradigm to improve short-distance relation identification.

Result: Experiments on TB-Dense and MATRES datasets show that GDLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in ETRE tasks.

Conclusion: GDLLM enhances identification of minority relation classes and overall learning ability by effectively utilizing global features via LLMs and specialized modeling techniques.

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Rohan Phanse,Yijie Zhou,Kejian Shi,Wencai Zhang,Yixin Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops an evaluation framework to challenge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in multi-source retrieval and synthesis tasks with long-form responses, proposing two benchmarks: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented systems lack robustness in handling queries requiring integration and summarization across multiple sources, making it difficult to meet real-world application demands.

Method: A scalable evaluation framework is designed alongside the construction of two benchmarks, MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, focusing on narrative synthesis and summarization tasks where retrieval and generation are tested on large collections.

Result: Experiments with diverse RAG pipelines show that generation quality is strongly influenced by retrieval performance, which varies by task. Reasoning models significantly outperform standard LLMs in multi-source synthesis tasks, even under optimal retrieval settings.

Conclusion: Multi-source retrieval and synthesis remain challenging for RAG systems, highlighting the need for advanced reasoning capabilities and effective retrieval mechanisms to improve generation quality.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

*Benjamin Marie,Atsushi Fujita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques for multilingual machine translation across 55 languages on large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying resource-intensive LLMs on hardware with limited computational power requires effective quantization, but its impact on multilingual tasks is underexplored.

Method: The authors evaluate four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), varying bit precision and model size, while assessing translation quality across high- and low-resource languages.

Result: 4-bit quantization often retains quality for high-resource languages, but performance significantly drops for low-resource languages in 2-bit setups. GGUF variants display superior and consistent results, even at 2-bit precision.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights on quantization choice and language-specific calibration for LLM deployment under hardware constraints, especially benefitting low-resource language settings.

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SageLM, a novel speech-to-speech large language model (S2S LLM) designed to evaluate spoken dialogue systems comprehensively based on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, achieving high alignment with human evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of effectively evaluating speech-to-speech (S2S) language models, which are essential for seamless human-computer interactions.

Method: The proposed approach employs SageLM, which integrates semantic and acoustic assessments, incorporates rationale-based supervision for enhanced explainability, and uses a synthetic dataset ('SpeechFeedback') along with a two-stage training paradigm.

Result: SageLM achieves an 82.79% agreement rate with human evaluators, surpassing cascaded and SLM-based baselines by significant margins (7.42% and 26.20%, respectively).

Conclusion: SageLM demonstrates the potential for robust, explainable, and human-aligned evaluations of S2S LLMs, opening avenues for improving natural spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA) framework, which improves consistency, compliance, and information accuracy in tool-calling agents during multi-turn conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address frequent issues faced by large language model (LLM)-based agents—such as inconsistent reasoning, non-adherence to domain-specific policies, and long-term information accuracy—when interacting in dynamic and multi-turn conversational environments like τ-bench.

Method: The authors first conduct a manual analysis of common errors in conversation trajectories. Following this, they experiment with various reformulated tool-calling inputs to improve decision-making. Based on these experiments, they develop the IRMA framework, which automatically reformulates user queries by adding domain-specific rules and suggesting relevant tools for use.

Result: The proposed IRMA framework outperforms existing methods like ReAct, Function Calling, and Self-Reflection, improving overall pass^5 scores by margins of 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1% respectively.

Conclusion: IRMA demonstrates superior reliability and consistency compared to other contemporary methods, emphasizing its potential for improving LLM performance in dynamic and multi-turn conversational applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage exemplar selection strategy for improving in-context learning (ICL) in semantic parsing tasks, focusing on structural alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of exemplar selection in ICL, particularly for structured prediction tasks like semantic parsing, where current methods fail due to poor structural alignment.

Method: The method involves a two-stage approach: first, fine-tuning a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision; second, enhancing the retriever with a plug-in module to amplify syntactically meaningful information.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates consistent performance improvement over existing baselines across four benchmarks and with multiple recent LLMs.

Conclusion: Integrating structural alignment into exemplar selection significantly enhances ICL performance, and the proposed method is efficient, generalizable, and easy to incorporate into existing workflows.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many current evaluations of proactive dialogue in LLMs focus on specific domains or tasks, lacking a unified approach to assessing comprehensive capabilities.

Method: Proposed ProactiveEval framework that decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue guidance, with evaluation metrics, automatic data generation, and experiments on 328 environments across 6 domains.

Result: DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet excel in target planning and dialogue guidance, respectively, based on evaluations of 22 LLMs.

Conclusion: The study underscores the role of reasoning in proactive dialogue and provides insights for future LLM development.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LETHE, a method to defend large language models (LLMs) against advanced backdoor attacks by using knowledge dilution through internal and external mechanisms, achieving significant success while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) to backdoor attacks, where specific triggers can activate harmful or unintended model behaviors.

Method: The proposed method, LETHE, uses knowledge dilution in two ways: internally by merging a clean model with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious parameters, and externally by adding benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompts to distract the model from activating backdoor triggers.

Result: LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art baselines on 8 backdoor attacks, reducing attack success rates by up to 98% and preserving model performance, all while being cost-efficient and robust to adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: LETHE is an effective, comprehensive, and cost-efficient defense mechanism for mitigating backdoor attacks in LLMs, offering robustness even against advanced attacks while maintaining the utility of the models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

Conclusion: EASI-RAG simplifies RAG deployment for SMEs, with future work focusing on generalizing diverse use cases and enhancing integration with fine-tuned models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization

### [73] [Re-Representation in Sentential Relation Extraction with Sequence Routing Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21049)
*Ramazan Ali Bahrami,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using dynamic routing in capsules for sentential relation extraction (RE), achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets but facing challenges with noisy data and re-representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in accurately extracting relationships between entities in a sentence, which is crucial for various NLP applications.

Method: The paper employs dynamic routing in capsules to perform sentential RE, outperforming existing approaches. It also investigates the reasons for varying performance across datasets.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, and Conll04 datasets. However, its performance is lower on the Wikidata dataset due to label noise.

Conclusion: The study identifies label noise and the challenge of re-representation as key factors influencing performance in sentential RE, highlighting areas for improvement in future research.

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

*William Jurayj,Nils Holzenberger,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuro-symbolic system integrating LLMs and symbolic solvers for precise tax calculation, evaluated on the complex SARA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tax filing is costly and error-prone, requiring high accuracy due to penalties, which modern LLMs struggle to achieve alone.

Method: The authors combine rule translation into formal logic and exemplars for case representations with an LLM and symbolic solver integration.

Result: Their system reduces error-related penalties and costs below real-world averages, showing improved performance on the SARA dataset.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic architectures are viable for reliable and cost-effective tax assistance, enhancing equitable access.

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

*Alberto Compagnoni,Davide Caffagni,Nicholas Moratelli,Lorenzo Baraldi,Marcella Cornia,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHAIR-DPO, a fine-tuning method that reduces hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using the CHAIR metric and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at many tasks but suffer from hallucination issues, where they generate content not grounded in visual input, necessitating solutions for alignment.

Method: The authors use the CHAIR metric to identify hallucinated versus non-hallucinated outputs. They then fine-tune MLLMs using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to encourage hallucination-free outputs.

Result: CHAIR-DPO reduces hallucinations effectively across multiple benchmarks, proving its efficacy as a fine-tuning solution.

Conclusion: Utilizing the CHAIR metric in combination with DPO provides a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations in MLLMs, ensuring more accurate and reliable outputs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [76] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel forensic framework based on Stable Diffusion (SD3) achieves superior image forgery localization without requiring extensive annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image forgery localization methods relying on costly annotated data are insufficient to detect manipulations generated by advanced multi-modal large models like Stable Diffusion.

Method: The approach utilizes Stable Diffusion's multi-modal framework and treats image forgery residuals as an explicit modality, integrating them into the latent space while preserving semantic information.

Result: The proposed model improves forgery localization performance by up to 12% on standard benchmarks and excels in real-world scenarios, even with unseen training data.

Conclusion: This study establishes a groundbreaking image forensic framework leveraging Stable Diffusion, showcasing its capability to handle cutting-edge image manipulation while maintaining efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

*Max Torop,Masih Eskandar,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jinyang Liu,Jochen Weber,Octavia Camps,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy,Kivanc Kose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores improving the interpretability of AI-based skin disease diagnosis by integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with quantitative attribute usage and demonstrates the approach using the SLICE-3D dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make AI-based models practical for clinicians, their predictions need improved interpretability, as current models lack sufficient reasoning insights for diagnosis.

Method: The approach combines Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for natural language reasoning with a grounding in quantitative attributes (e.g., lesion area) that correlate with malignancy. Fine-tuning techniques are used to map embedding spaces to these attributes, and the method is evaluated with content-based image retrieval on the SLICE-3D dataset.

Result: The MLLM embedding spaces were successfully grounded in quantitative attributes. The approach demonstrated promising results in facilitating attribute-specific image retrieval, showcasing improved interpretability potential.

Conclusion: The integration of MLLMs with quantitative attribute usage offers a feasible path to enhancing interpretability in AI-based diagnosis of skin diseases, serving as a step forward towards clinical usability.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vision Transformer (ViT) framework for Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR), focusing on improving label efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AMR methods depend heavily on large labeled datasets and multi-stage training, which hinder practical scalability and generalization.

Method: The unified framework combines supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and reconstruction objectives within a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder, a convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier to anchor fine-grained signal structures.

Result: On the RML2018.01A dataset, the proposed method outperformed CNN and ViT baselines in limited-label scenarios, achieving comparable ResNet accuracy with 15-20% labeled data and strong performance across varying SNR levels.

Conclusion: This simple yet effective framework offers a scalable, generalizable, and label-efficient solution for AMR.

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework, is proposed to tackle challenges in audio-driven human animation that ensures high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance, realistic hand motions, and better lip synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing audio-driven human animation methods, such as appearance consistency issues, identity drift, scene instability, and poorly modeled hand movements.

Method: InfinityHuman utilizes a coarse-to-fine framework: starting with generating audio-synchronized representations and refining them using a pose-guided refiner. Stable poses act as visual anchors, and a hand-specific reward mechanism ensures gesture realism.

Result: Experiments on EMTD and HDTF datasets show InfinityHuman surpasses current methods in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip synchronization.

Conclusion: InfinityHuman advances the field of audio-driven human animation by addressing key challenges and demonstrating its effectiveness through ablation studies and experimental evaluations.

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [80] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers developed two saliency prediction models for omnidirectional videos (ODVs) focusing on audio-visual integration and spherical distortion adjustments. They introduced a new dataset, YT360-EyeTracking, and demonstrated superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the lack of comprehensive datasets and effective models for predicting viewer attention in ODVs, especially in scenarios integrating spatial audio.

Method: The researchers curated the YT360-EyeTracking dataset and introduced two models—SalViT360 (vision-transformer-based) and SalViT360-AV (incorporates spatial audio)—with geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention.

Result: Both models, SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV, significantly outperformed existing approaches in benchmarks for 360-degree video saliency prediction.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatial audio cues into saliency prediction models is vital for accurately predicting viewer focus in omnidirectional video contexts.

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pipeline leveraging vision-language models to explain vision models both at sample and dataset levels, connecting performance metrics with explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models prioritize accuracy metrics like IoU and mAP, with limited research on comprehensive explainability methods. Understanding models’ general behaviors is critical to avoid biases and detect patterns.

Method: The study introduces a pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models to explain the behavior of vision models at both individual sample and wider dataset levels. This ensures minimal effort in xAI applications.

Result: The pipeline successfully aids in identifying failure cases and extracting insights into how vision models behave across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach bridges the gap between performance-focused vision model development and xAI-driven insights, fostering more holistic advancements in image analysis.

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ATMS-KD, a novel framework combining adaptive temperature scheduling and mixed-sample augmentation for lightweight CNN model training, achieving high accuracy and efficiency in agricultural vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of resource constraints in agricultural environments by designing lightweight models without compromising performance.

Method: Combines adaptive temperature scheduling and mixed-sample augmentation for knowledge distillation from a MobileNetV3 teacher to lightweight residual CNN students.

Result: Achieved over 96.7% validation accuracy for all student models, outperforming eleven other knowledge distillation methods and surpassing direct training methods.

Conclusion: The ATMS-KD framework effectively transfers knowledge to lightweight models, maintaining high accuracy and low latency, proving suitable for resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-language framework combining deep learning with domain expertise to classify microstructures in additive manufacturing, enhancing scalability and human-involvement without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industry struggles with qualifying advanced materials quickly and effectively, especially for those made through non-conventional processes like additive manufacturing.

Method: The approach involves integrating deep semantic segmentation with pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA) to encode microstructural and textual expert-based data, supplemented by a customized similarity-based representation for classification using positive and negative references.

Result: Validation on metal matrix composites shows effective zero-shot classification of defects. The FLAVA model excels at visual sensitivity while CLIP aligns well with textual criteria. Z-score normalization improves scoring consistency.

Conclusion: This work supports human-guided, scalable qualification pipelines by improving traceability and interpretability, while removing the need for retraining specialized models.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses automated perivascular spaces (PVS) segmentation in MRI, proposing MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder network. This model achieves high performance in some cases but faces limitations in diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automated segmentation of perivascular spaces (PVS) in MRI, addressing challenges like time-consuming manual methods, moderate reliability, and the inability of current models to generalize across datasets.

Method: The researchers adapted the MedNeXt-L-k5 model, using a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder network, and trained it on both homogeneous and heterogeneous MRI datasets. Performance was evaluated through internal 5-fold and leave-one-site-out cross-validation.

Result: The model achieved high Dice scores (0.88) for white matter (WM) with homogeneous T2w datasets but lower scores (0.58) for homogeneous T1w datasets. In diverse datasets, the performance decreased significantly, particularly in leave-one-site-out validation.

Conclusion: While MedNeXt-L-k5 is efficient for automated PVS segmentation in specific contexts, it struggles with dataset diversity and didn't outperform the nnU-Net, suggesting the attention-based mechanisms of transformer-inspired models may not be essential.

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free framework improving CLIP's open-vocabulary segmentation through feedback-driven patch-level correspondences, boosting semantic consistency and spatial coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor spatial coherence and semantic discrepancies, limiting its potential.

Method: A training-free framework is proposed, leveraging models' output-based patch correspondences to refine intermediate attention using modules such as attention isolation and confidence-based pruning.

Result: The method improves performance across multiple benchmarks, seamlessly plugging into various state-of-the-art approaches and backbones.

Conclusion: Utilizing output predictions as spatial coherence priors helps resolve CLIP's localization issues, enhancing semantic alignment and overall segmentation quality.

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

Motivation: The motivation is to better understand the internal layer-wise processing dynamics of Multimodal Large Language Models, which remain underexplored despite their strong performance.

Method: The proposed method trains linear classifiers to predict visual categories from token embeddings at different layers, evaluating the classifiers under controlled prompt variations, including lexical differences, semantic negations, and output format changes.

Result: The results indicate a consistent stage-wise structure in MLLMs, where early layers handle visual grounding, middle layers support semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare outputs. Layer allocations vary based on the base LLM architecture.

Conclusion: The findings offer a unified view of layer-wise processing in MLLMs and propose a lightweight, model-agnostic framework for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

*Zhi Li,Hau Phan,Matthew Emigh,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a supervised dictionary learning method for disentangling vision-language embedding spaces to enable precise concept-filtered image retrieval and conditional generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of separating complex scene information in vision-language embeddings for better retrieval and generation tasks.

Method: A supervised dictionary learning framework that decomposes embeddings into sparse, non-negative combinations of dictionary vectors grouped by labels.

Result: Disentangled embeddings improve precision in concept-filtered image retrieval and enable enhanced conditional generation.

Conclusion: The proposed Sparse Linear Concept Subspaces (SLiCS) technique effectively optimizes embeddings across multiple models like CLIP, TiTok, and DINOv2, showcasing significant advancements in precision-driven tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MedFoundationHub, a GUI toolkit addressing security and usability challenges in deploying medical vision-language models (VLMs) within clinical environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address security concerns such as PHI exposure and data leakage in implementing medical VLMs while making deployment accessible for non-experts.

Method: Developing MedFoundationHub, a secure GUI toolkit compatible with local offline workstation setups using Docker orchestration and integration of Hugging Face models. It facilitates model selection by physicians and engineers without extensive expertise.

Result: MedFoundationHub enables efficient deployment and privacy-preserving inference. Expert evaluations of five VLMs revealed recurring shortcomings like vague reasoning and inconsistent terminology in clinical cases.

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub improves accessibility and security of medical VLM deployment, but model responses require refinement to meet clinical standards.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM) to improve multi-task dense prediction efficiency and interaction quality. It leverages BI-Scan and MS-Scan mechanisms to achieve this with better results at lower computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to achieve sufficient cross-task interaction without high computational complexity in multi-task dense prediction.

Method: The paper proposes BIM, which uses Bidirectional Interaction Scan (BI-Scan) and Multi-Scale Scan (MS-Scan) mechanisms for efficient and effective task interactions.

Result: Experiments conducted on NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate BIM's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors in terms of cross-task interaction and efficiency.

Conclusion: BIM offers a solution to address the trade-off between computational efficiency and interaction completeness, making it advantageous over existing multi-task dense prediction methods.

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

*Hyeonyu Kim,Seokhoon Jeong,Seonghee Han,Chanhyuk Choi,Taehwan Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach for audio-guided visual editing, addressing challenges where text-guidance is insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual editing methods struggle with scenarios where textual guidance is inadequate, highlighting the need for additional editing prompts such as audio.

Method: The authors employ a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with zero-shot capabilities to integrate audio into visual editing tasks and alleviate discrepancies between encoder spaces. They introduce noise branching and patch selection methods for handling multi-modal prompts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that their framework effectively incorporates audio-guidance for complex editing tasks, outperforming text-only approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully expands the capability of visual editing systems, enhancing their ability to process multifaceted scenarios using audio alongside text cues.

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

*Luong Tran,Thieu Vo,Anh Nguyen,Sang Dinh,Van Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for multi-label learning with limited annotations by focusing on pseudo-labeling and loss robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label learning is often hampered by difficulties in fully annotating large-scale datasets, necessitating solutions for partially annotated data such as Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML).

Method: The paper proposes the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss) for handling noise in pseudo-labels and Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) for pseudo-label generation. Both methods are integrated into the AEVLP framework.

Result: AEVLP achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-label classification, demonstrated through experiments on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively improve multi-label learning under limited and partially annotated scenarios, validating their robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a delay-spike approach and a temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to improve visual detection tasks, achieving ultra-low latency and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ANN-SNN conversion methods perform well in classification tasks but struggle with visual detection tasks, highlighting a need for improvements in feature representation and latency reduction within SNNs.

Method: The authors propose two innovations: a delay-spike approach to manage residual membrane potentials, and a novel tdIF neuron architecture to dynamically adjust spiking behaviors based on time-step order, emphasizing temporal properties over frequency-based representations.

Result: The proposed techniques deliver more precise feature representations, maintain traditional energy levels, and demonstrate superior performance in object detection and lane line detection tasks with ultra-low latency (≤5 time-steps).

Conclusion: The delay-spike and tdIF methods significantly advance SNN performance in visual detection tasks, setting a benchmark for high accuracy and efficiency in ultra-low latency applications.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DUP-MCRNet, a network for salient object detection (SOD) that addresses challenges in capturing details, edge clarity, and fusing single-modal information in complex scenes. It uses uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative fusion for improved detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOD methods struggle with details, edge precision, and ineffective fusion of single-modal information in complex environments.

Method: The method involves 1) a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) for uncertainty propagation and spatial semantic improvements, 2) a multimodal collaborative fusion (MCF) strategy for optimal RGB, depth, and edge feature integration via gating weights, and 3) multi-scale evaluation metrics with specific loss functions and guidance mechanisms.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that DUP-MCRNet achieves superior performance compared to other SOD methods, excelling especially in edge clarity and robustness against complex scenes across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet effectively addresses limitations in existing SOD methods, improving detection accuracy, edge clarity, and handling of complex backgrounds, and thus is a significant advancement in the SOD domain.

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD) to improve pedestrian detection in bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images using multi-scale image feature projection and processing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MVPD methods struggle with detecting pedestrians at varying scales due to the lack of multi-scale feature exploitation.

Method: MSMVD uses multi-scale image features from different views to generate BEV features, which are processed by a feature pyramid network to handle scale variations.

Result: The MSMVD method achieves significant improvements, increasing the MODA metric by 4.5 points on the GMVD dataset.

Conclusion: The exploitation of multi-scale features and multi-scale BEV generation significantly enhances detection accuracy, making MSMVD a superior method for pedestrian detection in MVPD tasks.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SFMFNet, a lightweight network for real-time deepfake detection, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection methods often suffer from high computational costs, making them impractical for real-time use despite their accuracy.

Method: The SFMFNet architecture includes three main innovations: spatial-frequency hybrid modules for subtle manipulation detection, token-selective cross attention for multi-level feature interaction, and residual-enhanced blur pooling for semantic cue preservation during downsampling.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SFMFNet maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost, showing strong generalization and practical applicability.

Conclusion: SFMFNet offers a promising solution for real-time deepfake detection, effectively balancing computational efficiency with detection performance.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical applications often face computational constraints, making it essential to develop lightweight yet high-performance models for medical image classification.

Method: The approach involves initializing two lightweight models with weights from a large pretrained model using dual-model weight selection, followed by self-knowledge distillation and fine-tuning for specific classification tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on chest X-ray, lung CT, and brain MRI datasets show superior performance and robustness of the proposed method compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: Combining dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation addresses limitations in conventional methods, enabling lightweight models to retain critical information and achieve competitive performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: This paper enhances LiDAR point cloud compression using compact features through a lightweight predictive coding framework, achieving better compression ratios and real-time speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR point cloud data is resource-demanding in storage and transmission, and current methods struggle with the sparsity in geometric details limiting compression performance.

Method: The authors introduce two lightweight modules: Geometry Re-Densification for extracting compact features at denser scales, and Cross-scale Feature Propagation for guiding hierarchical feature sharing across resolutions.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios at 12-bit quantization with real-time performance of 26 FPS for encoding and decoding.

Conclusion: Integrating innovative lightweight modules significantly improves compression efficiency and accelerates computation, showcasing advancements in LiDAR data handling.

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

TL;DR: This paper proposes using videos as a supervisory signal for 3D asset generation, introducing a large-scale video dataset and a generative model that creates spatially consistent and semantically accurate 3D content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D data scarcity limits the capabilities of large-data-trained models. Videos, which are more abundant, offer valuable spatial and semantic priors to mitigate these limitations.

Method: The authors introduce Droplet3D-4M, a video dataset with multi-view annotations, and Droplet3D, a generative model trained to synthesize 3D content from image and text prompts using video priors.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed approach produces 3D content that is both spatially consistent and semantically plausible. Unlike current methods, it has potential scalability to scene-level applications.

Conclusion: The use of commonsense priors extracted from videos can effectively address 3D data scarcity, advancing 3D content generation and expanding its applicability. All resources are open-sourced, fostering further research.

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant

Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous

*Jiusi Li,Jackson Jiang,Jinyu Miao,Miao Long,Tuopu Wen,Peijin Jia,Shengxiang Liu,Chunlei Yu,Maolin Liu,Yuzhan Cai,Kun Jiang,Mengmeng Yang,Diange Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents G^2Editor for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos to address limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Corner cases in autonomous driving require diverse training data, which is costly and risky to collect from the real world.

Method: The method involves leveraging a 3D Gaussian representation during the denoising process to ensure accurate pose control, along with the use of hierarchical features and 3D bounding box layouts for scene reconstruction.

Result: G^2Editor outperforms existing techniques in pose control and visual fidelity in tasks like object positioning and benefits downstream tasks.

Conclusion: G^2Editor is an effective framework for creating realistic and accurate corner-case scenarios for autonomous driving, aiding both in visual fidelity and training data diversity.

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

### [101] [Enhancing Corpus Callosum Segmentation in Fetal MRI via Pathology-Informed Domain Randomization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20475)
*Marina Grifell i Plana,Vladyslav Zalevskyi,Léa Schmidt,Yvan Gomez,Thomas Sanchez,Vincent Dunet,Mériam Koob,Vanessa Siffredi,Meritxell Bach Cuadra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy to create synthetic data for fetal brain segmentation, specifically addressing challenges in cases with corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited data availability for rare conditions like CCD hinders deep learning model generalization, demanding innovative approaches for accurate biomarker extraction and neurodevelopment assessment.

Method: The authors embed CCD anatomical prior knowledge into synthetic data generation, simulating brain alterations and enabling robust segmentation without pathological annotations.

Result: The proposed method improves CCD segmentation accuracy while maintaining performance on healthy and other pathological cases, with error reductions in biomarkers estimation (e.g., corpus callosum length) and better topological consistency.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific priors into synthetic data mitigates data scarcity and enhances segmentation reliability, proving valuable for analyzing rare malformations like CCD.

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

*Loïc Stratil,Felix Fent,Esteban Rivera,Markus Lienkamp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper surveys and categorizes methods in unified perception for autonomous vehicles, offering a comprehensive framework and highlighting future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of modular pipelines in autonomous vehicle perception by exploring unified perception methods.

Method: Developing a taxonomy for unified perception, categorizing approaches, systematically reviewing methods, and identifying research gaps.

Result: The paper consolidates fragmented methods into a unified framework, defines three paradigms, reviews architectures and datasets, and proposes future directions.

Conclusion: Unified perception offers potential improvements in robustness, efficiency, and interpretability, and this survey provides a foundational framework for further exploration.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

### [103] [Towards Inclusive Communication: A Unified LLM-Based Framework for Sign Language, Lip Movements, and Audio Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20476)
*Jeong Hun Yeo,Hyeongseop Rha,Sungjune Park,Junil Won,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework for generating spoken-language text using diverse inputs like sign language, lip movements, and audio. It achieves results comparable to or superior to specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional speech recognition systems rely heavily on audio, making them inaccessible to certain users. There is a need for a unified solution to integrate alternative communication modalities like sign language and lip reading.

Method: The paper designs a modality-agnostic architecture to process various inputs, investigates the synergy between modalities, and aims to outperform state-of-the-art models for specific tasks.

Result: The framework matches or surpasses specialized models in SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. It shows that modeling lip movements separately enhances sign language translation.

Conclusion: Integrating multiple modalities into a unified framework helps improve accessibility and enhances performance in spoken-language text generation tasks.

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

*Enrico Martini,Ho Jin Choi,Nadia Figueroa,Nicola Bombieri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces COMETH, a lightweight and scalable algorithm for real-time human pose fusion using multi-camera setups, which integrates biomechanical constraints, convex optimization, and a state observer to achieve high accuracy and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance human activity monitoring in Industry 5.0 environments by addressing limitations in scalability, computational costs, and accuracy of multi-camera real-time pose estimation, especially on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: COMETH uses kinematic and biomechanical constraints for joint positioning accuracy, convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial pose fusion, and a state observer for improved temporal consistency.

Result: COMETH was tested on public and industrial datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy.

Conclusion: COMETH enables scalable and accurate human motion tracking suitable for industrial and safety-critical applications, bridging the gap between edge-device limitations and real-time analytics needs.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

*Yuan Xie,Tianshui Chen,Zheng Ge,Lionel Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video-MTR, a framework for long-form video understanding that uses iterative multi-turn reasoning to enhance video segment selection and question comprehension, yielding improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing methods in long-form video understanding, such as reliance on external models and lack of end-to-end training.

Method: The proposed Video-MTR framework employs iterative reasoning over video segments using a gated bi-level reward system to optimize comprehension and selection processes without external visual-language models.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets like VideoMME, MLVU, and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Video-MTR advances long-form video understanding by introducing multi-turn reasoning and eliminating dependence on external models, enabling more precise and contextually aware analyses.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

### [106] [Adaptive Dual Uncertainty Optimization: Boosting Monocular 3D Object Detection under Test-Time Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20488)
*Zixuan Hu,Dongxiao Li,Xinzhu Ma,Shixiang Tang,Xiaotong Li,Wenhan Yang,Ling-Yu Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DUO, a Test-Time Adaptation framework aiming to minimize semantic and geometric uncertainties in monocular 3D object detection to combat domain shifts in real-world applications like autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of monocular 3D object detection systems suffers under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor variations, creating a need for methods to adapt during inference.

Method: The authors propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), which leverages convex optimization, unsupervised focal loss, and semantic-aware normal field constraints to jointly minimize semantic and geometric uncertainties during adaptation.

Result: DUO achieves robust 3D object detection performance and outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness across various datasets and types of domain shifts.

Conclusion: The DUO framework successfully addresses the challenges posed by dual uncertainties in monocular 3D object detection, improving adaptability and robustness in dynamic real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogVLA is a Vision-Language-Action model framework that improves efficiency and performance through innovative routing and sparsification techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiencies in current Vision-Language-Action models, which require extensive post-training, leading to high computational costs and limited scalability.

Method: CogVLA introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture: EFA-Routing for compressing visual tokens using instruction information, LFP-Routing for pruning instruction-irrelevant tokens to introduce sparsity, and V-L-A Coupled Attention for accurate and coherent vision-language-action processing.

Result: CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like LIBERO and real-world robotic tasks, with substantial reductions in training costs (2.5-fold) and inference latency (2.8-fold) compared to OpenVLA.

Conclusion: The proposed framework not only enhances performance but also significantly reduces computational overhead, making it more scalable and practical for deployment. It is also open-sourced for community access.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

*Seunghyeon Jung,Seoyoung Hong,Jiwoo Jeong,Seungwon Jeong,Jaerim Choi,Hoki Kim,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset, CaddieSet, which links swing postures to ball trajectories and provides interpretable insights for golfers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies struggle to quantitatively relate swing posture to ball trajectory, limiting their usefulness for improving golfers' performance.

Method: The authors developed CaddieSet, a dataset derived from swing videos segmented into phases, along with 15 metrics for swing analysis, leveraging computer vision and golf expertise.

Result: CaddieSet was used to predict ball trajectories with interpretable models that align with established golf domain knowledge.

Conclusion: The dataset provides actionable swing feedback insights, offering benefits for golf swing analysis in both academic research and the sports industry.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

*Xuanming Cao,Chengyu Tao,Yifeng Cheng,Juan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces IAENet, a hybrid anomaly detection framework leveraging both 2D and 3D data to improve industrial product quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface anomaly detection is critical for industrial manufacturing. While effective 2D methods exist, the potential of 3D point cloud-based approaches remains unexplored due to the lack of robust pretrained models in 3D.

Method: The authors propose IAENet, which uses an Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module to dynamically reweight the contributions of 2D and 3D modalities based on their performance. Custom loss functions support the optimization of the fusion approach.

Result: IAENet sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset, achieving a lower false positive rate compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: IAENet demonstrates enhanced anomaly detection capabilities by combining the strengths of 2D and 3D modalities, positioning it as a valuable solution for industrial applications.

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

*En Ci,Shanyan Guan,Yanhao Ge,Yilin Zhang,Wei Li,Zhenyu Zhang,Jian Yang,Ying Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DescriptiveEdit introduces a framework for semantic image editing based on descriptive prompts, enhancing accuracy and capabilities without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in semantic image editing, including reconstruction errors and limited dataset quality in existing methods.

Method: A Cross-Attentive UNet is used with attention bridges to incorporate features from reference images into text-to-image generation for editing tasks.

Result: Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark indicate improved editing accuracy and consistency, achieving scalability and compatibility with existing extensions.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit provides a scalable and more accurate solution to semantic image editing, leveraging descriptive prompts and avoiding limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

*Wenting Yin,Han Sun,Xinru Meng,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFS introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning to address continual test-time adaptation challenges, minimizing error accumulation and enhancing adaptation using pseudo-labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the problem of error accumulation and bias in existing continual test-time adaptation methods that rely on pseudo-labels without source domain data.

Method: DCFS framework disentangles target domain features into semantic-related and domain-related features using dual classifiers. It maintains consistency between sub-features and the whole feature while employing confidence scoring and adaptive thresholds for loss-weighted self-supervised learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C validate the method’s efficacy, showing improved continual test-time adaptation performance compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: DCFS effectively reduces pseudo-label noise and biases, leading to better feature representation and consistent adaptation performance in continual test-time scenarios.

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

*Matthieu Gendrin,Stéphane Pateux,Xiaoran Jiang,Théo Ladune,Luce Morin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to refine camera calibration for better novel view synthesis using a backpropagation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the importance of camera calibration for novel view synthesis quality, as even minor errors significantly impact reconstruction.

Method: The paper uses a 3DGS model for fine-tuning camera calibration by backpropagating color loss with respect to camera parameters.

Result: The proposed method improves PSNR by an average of 0.4 dB on a reference dataset.

Conclusion: Although fine-tuning may be time-intensive, it is crucial for achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in reference scenes.

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

*Jingyun Yang,Guoqing Zhang,Jingge Wang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an active and sequential domain adaptation framework for multi-modal medical data segmentation to reduce annotation costs and improve segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling medical images is costly and labor-intensive, necessitating efficient strategies to make the annotation process more effective for segmentation tasks.

Method: The authors propose a framework focusing on dynamically selecting samples based on informativeness and representativeness, avoiding one-off selection to minimize negative transfer.

Result: The framework showed superior segmentation performance across various gross tumor volume segmentation tasks compared to state-of-the-art ADA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework helps address the challenges of labeling medical data efficiently while advancing segmentation performance in radiotherapy planning for important medical conditions.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Motivation: Obtaining high-quality 3D labels is difficult, prompting an exploration of ways to improve pseudo-box creation for unsupervised 3D object detection.

Method: Data-level fusion of RGB images and LiDAR data is employed, with bi-directional enhancement, local/global filtering to mitigate noise, and iterative refinement strategies for better detection outcomes.

Result: On the nuScenes dataset, the proposed method achieved 28.4% mAP, surpassing previous state-of-the-art unsupervised 3D object detection techniques.

Conclusion: Data-level fusion, combined with vision models and filtering techniques, significantly boosts performance, providing a promising alternative for label-efficient training of 3D object detectors.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable rapid and accurate BMI assessment from camera images in situations where traditional methods are unavailable or impractical.

Method: Used deep learning techniques and a proprietary dataset (WayBED) with over 84,000 smartphone images, applying an automatic filtering process to improve image quality for training. Metrics were evaluated, and the system was deployed via the CLAID framework on mobile devices.

Result: Achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on the hold-out WayBED test set and 13% on an unseen VisualBodyToBMI dataset. Fine-tuned results on VisualBodyToBMI reached a MAPE of 8.56%, surpassing prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates robust and generalizable BMI estimation capabilities with high accuracy using smartphone images, successfully enabling mobile deployment.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness of domain adaptation techniques in addressing distribution differences, particularly in the challenging domain of medical image data.

Method: Conducted 557 simulation studies using seven DA techniques on five natural and eight medical datasets, including scenarios like out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited training samples.

Result: DSAN algorithm showed superior results with 91.2% accuracy on the COVID-19 dataset and significant accuracy improvement (+6.7%) in dynamic data streams; also exhibited high explainability in medical datasets.

Conclusion: The study reveals DSAN's potential for high performance and explainability in medical datasets, offering insights on effective domain adaptation for complex data.

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLAB, a contrastive learning-based auxiliary method, to enhance video object detection without incurring extra computational cost during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges of video object detection, such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes, which make it harder than still image detection. Prior approaches addressing these issues often increase computational complexity.

Method: The paper introduces CLAB, which incorporates a contrastive auxiliary branch leveraging contrastive loss to enhance feature representation. A dynamic loss weighting strategy is also used to focus on auxiliary learning early in training and prioritize detection tasks later.

Result: CLAB consistently achieves robust performance improvements, reaching state-of-the-art mAP scores of 84.0% with ResNet-101 and 85.2% with ResNeXt-101 on the ImageNet VID dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed CLAB method significantly improves video object detection performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional computational load or complex post-processing.

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes and defends against typographic attacks targeting CLIP models, proposing a training-free method that improves robustness by ablating specific attention heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities of CLIP models to text-injected images causing undesirable outcomes like misclassification and malicious content generation.

Method: Locate attention heads transmitting typographic information in CLIP and selectively ablate these circuits, without requiring model finetuning.

Result: Defensive method improves model performance against typographic attacks by up to 19.6%, with negligible accuracy impact on standard datasets.

Conclusion: Released dyslexic CLIP models provide effective defense against typographic attacks while maintaining usability for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial Expression Recognition systems face challenges such as occlusion, variability, and lack of interpretability, necessitating solutions like GNNs for improved performance.

Method: GLaRE uses 3D facial alignment to extract landmarks and constructs quotient graphs through hierarchical coarsening to maintain spatial structure and reduce complexity.

Result: GLaRE attains 64.89% accuracy on AffectNet and 94.24% accuracy on FERG datasets, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: GLaRE effectively improves FER performance through structured relational modeling and region-level embeddings, addressing traditional system challenges.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The FastFit framework addresses inefficiencies and limitations in virtual try-on technology by using a cacheable diffusion method and a new dataset, achieving faster results with improved fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome two major challenges in virtual try-on technology: the inability to handle multi-reference outfit compositions and inefficiencies caused by redundant computations.

Method: The method involves introducing a cacheable diffusion architecture with a Semi-Attention mechanism and class embeddings to decouple feature encoding from the denoising process, improving speed and efficiency.

Result: The result is a 3.5x average speedup over existing methods, demonstrated on datasets like VITON-HD and the introduced DressCode-MR, while maintaining higher fidelity in output.

Conclusion: FastFit offers a significant advancement in the virtual try-on domain by solving scalability and efficiency issues, supported by a large new dataset for multi-reference cases.

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

### [121] [UTA-Sign: Unsupervised Thermal Video Augmentation via Event-Assisted Traffic Signage Sketching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20594)
*Yuqi Han,Songqian Zhang,Weijian Su,Ke Li,Jiayu Yang,Jinli Suo,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UTA-Sign, a method combining thermal and event cameras to enhance traffic sign recognition under low-light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal cameras struggle to identify signage from similar materials in low-light environments, which can be a safety risk in autonomous driving. Event cameras complement thermal cameras due to their ability to capture changes in light intensity effectively in such conditions.

Method: UTA-Sign uses a dual-boosting mechanism to fuse thermal frames and event signals. Thermal frames provide motion cues, and event signals contribute subtle signage content for enhanced representation and alignment.

Result: The method was tested on real-world datasets, showing superior traffic signage sketching quality and improved detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Combining thermal and event camera modalities improves traffic signage understanding in low-light environments for safer autonomous navigation.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

*Mengxiao Huang,Minglei Shu,Shuwang Zhou,Zhaoyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an active defense against deepfake attacks by using perceptual low-frequency perturbations to reduce manipulation effectiveness while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods are reactive and fail to prevent manipulation before it occurs.

Method: The authors propose a method that uses low-frequency perceptual perturbations generated through a novel architecture with DWT-based components to obstruct deepfake generative processes.

Result: Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets show reduced deepfake efficacy and enhanced defense success rates with preserved visuals.

Conclusion: The proposed active defense effectively disrupts deepfake generation while maintaining the authenticity of visual content.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method called Diverse-T2M for generating diverse 3D human motions from text while maintaining text-motion consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of generating diverse human motions from text while maintaining high-quality and precise text-motion consistency.

Method: The method introduces uncertainty into the generation process using noise signals as carriers of diversity in transformer-based approaches and creates a latent space for stochastic sampling.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets (HumanML3D and KIT-ML) show that Diverse-T2M enhances diversity significantly while maintaining state-of-the-art text-motion consistency.

Conclusion: Diverse-T2M effectively overcomes the challenge of diversity in text-to-motion generation without compromising semantic consistency.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and limited field of view in intraoperative liver ultrasound imaging make it challenging to interpret, necessitating a technique for bridging preoperative data with intraoperative guidance.

Method: The researchers developed an optimization-based calibration approach using a 3D-printed phantom to enable accurate 3D IVUS volume reconstruction and alignment with CT scans.

Result: Validation using swine liver images demonstrated calibration errors ranging from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and registration errors between 3.40 to 5.71 mm.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables precise registration of intraoperative IVUS with preoperative CT data, enhancing intraoperative liver surgery guidance.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to generate synthetic Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) samples for defect localization in semiconductor manufacturing using a physics-informed generative model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited availability of proprietary Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) datasets for training machine learning models poses a bottleneck in leveraging MFI for defect localization in semiconductor manufacturing.

Method: The proposed method uses diffusion models integrated with physical constraints (PI-GenMFI) to generate synthetic MFI samples that replicate common defect types, such as power shorts.

Result: The study shows that the proposed PI-GenMFI model outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, including VAEs and other diffusion-based methods, using qualitative and quantitative image generation metrics.

Conclusion: The generated synthetic MFI samples prove useful for training ML models aimed at efficient defect localization, optimizing the semiconductor defect detection process.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

*Yixiang Qiu,Yanhan Liu,Hongyao Yu,Hao Fang,Bin Chen,Shu-Tao Xia,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a GAN-based approach to improve Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) in Split Inference by leveraging Progressive Feature Optimization, yielding better results across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy risks caused by intermediate feature exploitation in Split Inference, and to overcome the limitations of existing DRAs in terms of reconstruction quality and generalizability.

Method: A GAN-based Data Reconstruction Attack framework that implements Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO) to gradually refine representations and employs an L1-ball constraint to enhance image quality.

Result: The proposed method outperforms prior attacks significantly, especially in high-resolution, out-of-distribution, and deeper model contexts.

Conclusion: The novel approach improves the effectiveness and generalizability of DRAs, demonstrating better reconstruction fidelity and robustness against a wide range of challenges in Split Inference scenarios.

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Motivation: Address the limitations of current emotional talking head synthesis methods, including control flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality, while tackling the dataset limitations for practical usage.

Method: Presented EmoCAST, a framework using a text-guided decoupled emotive module and an emotive audio attention module. Constructed a new emotional talking head dataset and proposed specialized training strategies.

Result: EmoCAST achieved state-of-the-art performance on generating talking head videos that are realistic, emotionally expressive, and well-synchronized to audio.

Conclusion: The proposed EmoCAST framework advances emotional talking head synthesis by overcoming prior limitations, offering improvements in control, expression, and motion naturalness, with practical applications.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

### [129] [AvatarBack: Back-Head Generation for Complete 3D Avatars from Front-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20623)
*Shiqi Xin,Xiaolin Zhang,Yanbin Liu,Peng Zhang,Caifeng Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack introduces solutions for reconstructing realistic 3D Gaussian avatars, addressing challenges in modeling back-head regions and ensuring both consistency and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to 3D Gaussian head avatar modeling struggle with reconstructing the back-head regions, leading to reduced realism and structural inconsistencies.

Method: The framework integrates two innovations: Subject-specific Generator (SSG) for synthesizing plausible back-view images, and Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA) for precise geometric alignment using learnable transformation matrices.

Result: AvatarBack demonstrates enhanced back-head reconstruction quality and consistent realism across datasets while maintaining fidelity in frontal regions.

Conclusion: The framework provides a complete and animatable 3D Gaussian head avatar reconstruction, filling the gaps in back-head modeling and ensuring high-quality outputs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

*Francois Poh,Anjith George,Sébastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how foundation models can improve facial recognition in historical paintings, overcoming issues faced by traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Art historians struggle to identify sitters in historical paintings due to subjective methods, lack of data, and stylistic differences. Automated facial recognition, though successful with photos, faces challenges with paintings due to domain shifts and artistic factors.

Method: The authors fine-tuned foundation models and integrated their embeddings with existing facial recognition networks to improve results in recognizing faces in artworks.

Result: Their approach showed significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods and effectively addressed the limitations of traditional techniques.

Conclusion: Foundation models offer the potential to enhance facial recognition in artworks, bridging gaps left by conventional approaches.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

### [131] [CraftGraffiti: Exploring Human Identity with Custom Graffiti Art via Facial-Preserving Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20640)
*Ayan Banerjee,Fernando Vilariño,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti is a text-guided graffiti generation system prioritizing facial identity preservation under stylistic transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of preserving facial identity during extreme stylization in generative art, particularly in graffiti.

Method: CraftGraffiti uses a LoRA-fine-tuned diffusion model for style transfer, combined with a face-consistent self-attention mechanism and CLIP-guided prompt extensions for pose customization.

Result: The system achieves competitive facial feature consistency, high aesthetic scores, and real-world usage impact, such as live deployment at an art festival.

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti provides a principled AI framework for combining creative stylization with facial recognizability in artistic applications.

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

*Sihan Yang,Chenhang Cui,Zihao Zhao,Yiyang Zhou,Weilong Yan,Ying Wei,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel self-judgment scoring method to enhance alignment in large visual-language models (LVLMs) without relying on external datasets or annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of hallucinations and safety concerns in aligning linguistic and visual modalities in LVLMs, which are hindered by current costly and less scalable alignment methods.

Method: The paper introduces a self-judgment scoring mechanism, an internally generated self-evaluation metric that allows LVLMs to autonomously improve their alignment during decoding and preference tuning processes.

Result: The proposed method reduces hallucinations, improves safety, and enhances the overall capabilities of LVLMs, outperforming traditional alignment strategies.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for improving LVLM alignment, offering significant advancements over existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces S-HArM, a dataset focusing on intent-aware classification for AI-generated images, and conducts experiments to enhance inference of intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the oversight in understanding the intent behind AI-generated content and improve intent-aware classification.

Method: Introduced a labeled dataset of 9,576 image-text pairs and tested various prompting strategies using Stable Diffusion with extensive model comparisons.

Result: Models trained with image- and multimodal-guided data demonstrated better generalization to real-world contexts, but overall accuracy in inferring intent remains challenging.

Conclusion: Inferring intent in AI-generated content is complex, requiring advanced architectures to improve classification performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents MobileCLIP2, an improved family of MobileCLIP models with enhanced multi-modal reinforced training, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet-1k at low latencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the multi-modal reinforced training of MobileCLIP for better efficiency, scalability, and reproducibility, and achieve superior zero-shot accuracy at low latencies.

Method: The method involves better CLIP teacher ensembles trained on the DFN dataset, improved captioners fine-tuned on diverse datasets, and leveraging key insights like temperature tuning and synthetic caption combination. These enhancements lead to the development of the MobileCLIP2 model family.

Result: MobileCLIP2 achieves significant performance gains, including a 2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracy for the B model variant, and matches or exceeds the performance of larger models at lower latencies.

Conclusion: MobileCLIP2 sets a new benchmark for efficient and accurate zero-shot image-text reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of its novel training enhancements. The open-source release facilitates further research and development in this area.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes a dynamic video compression framework aimed at achieving precise rate control in variable bitrate scenarios. It introduces a Dynamic-Route Autoencoder and Rate Control Agent to optimize RD trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise rate control in neural video compression is a persistent challenge due to limitations in learning-based codecs.

Method: The method includes a Dynamic-Route Autoencoder with variable coding routes for bitrate adjustment and a Rate Control Agent for real-time optimization of coding routes. Joint-Routes Optimization is used for collaborative training across varying bitrates.

Result: Experiments on HEVC and UVG datasets demonstrate superior performance with an average BD-Rate reduction of 14.8%, BD-PSNR gain of 0.47 dB, and a low average bitrate error of 1.66%.

Conclusion: This framework effectively achieves Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization for diverse bitrate applications and demonstrates its potential in variable bitrate scenarios.

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

*Reza Akbari Movahed,Abuzar Rezaee,Arezoo Zakeri,Colin Berry,Edmond S. L. Ho,Ali Gooya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents CardioMorphNet, a recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for accurate 3D cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac MRI images, improving over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cardiac motion estimation methods face limitations due to reliance on intensity-based losses, which fail to adequately capture anatomical regions.

Method: The proposed method, CardioMorphNet, utilizes a recurrent variational autoencoder and posterior models for segmentation and motion estimation, avoiding intensity-based similarity losses while leveraging spatio-temporal features.

Result: CardioMorphNet outperforms existing methods in motion estimation and produces lower uncertainty values for estimated cardiac motion fields, validated on the UK Biobank dataset.

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet provides accurate and confident predictions for cardiac motion estimation, demonstrating its potential to advance cardiac function assessment.

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve the identification of atypical mitotic figures under domain shifts using style perturbation, domain alignment, and teacher-student distillation, achieving impressive accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately identifying atypical mitotic figures, crucial histopathological markers, is hindered by domain shifts caused by variations in scanner, stain, and acquisition methods.

Method: The method increases feature diversity through style perturbations, aligns features using domain labels, and stabilizes predictions with teacher-student distillation using EMA and temperature-scaled KL divergence.

Result: The approach achieves balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499 on the MIDOG 2025 preliminary leaderboard.

Conclusion: The method delivers robust, balanced performance for atypical mitotic figure classification, handles domain shifts effectively, incurs minimal runtime overhead, and is a competitive option for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel pairwise preference method, Pref-GRPO, to address reward hacking issues in reinforcement learning for text-to-image generation. Additionally, it introduces a comprehensive benchmarking framework, UniGenBench, for better model evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitations of current GRPO-based reinforcement learning methods that use pointwise reward models, which are prone to reward hacking and destabilize the image generation process.

Method: The proposed Pref-GRPO optimizes preference fitting using pairwise comparisons of generated images within groups, with win rates serving as reward signals. This addresses reward hacking issues. Additionally, the authors introduce UniGenBench, a benchmark with detailed semantic consistency evaluation metrics.

Result: Pref-GRPO provides more stable training and mitigates reward hacking by distinguishing subtle differences in image quality. UniGenBench effectively uncovers strengths and weaknesses of text-to-image models while validating Pref-GRPO's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO represents a robust enhancement for text-to-image generation methods, ensuring stable training and quality outputs. UniGenBench serves as a valuable benchmark to comprehensively evaluate T2I models and support the proposed method's efficacy.

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve geometry encoding and multi-view consistency in novel view synthesis using sparse input views.

Method: Incorporates context-aware, cross-dimension, and cross-scale learning constraints in a unified pipeline through lightweight modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and strong generalization on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Enhanced feature learning modules improve photorealistic synthesis with minimal supervision for unseen scenes.

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SeqVLM, a zero-shot framework for 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy by improving multi-view reasoning and preserving spatial and contextual details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot methods in 3DVG face challenges such as spatially-limited reasoning and contextual losses, which hinder their practical utility in real-world applications.

Method: SeqVLM generates 3D instance proposals using a segmentation network, refines them with semantic filtering, and applies a proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy. It dynamically schedules sequences to leverage cross-modal reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

Result: SeqVLM outperforms existing zero-shot methods on ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks, achieving Acc@0.25 scores of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous methods by 4.0% and 5.2%, respectively.

Conclusion: SeqVLM advances the generalization and real-world utility of zero-shot 3DVG models through multi-view spatial reasoning and effective integration with VLMs.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates robustness of CLIP vision-language models in military contexts facing occlusions, revealing key performance insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges faced by military applications where labeled data is scarce, coupled with occluded imagery and degraded signals.

Method: Analysis focused on CLIP variants using a custom dataset of military vehicle classes with occlusion applied, evaluated on model performance using NAUC metrics.

Result: Findings include superiority of transformer models over CNNs, finer occlusions impacting accuracy harshly, linear-probed models dropping in performance post 35% occlusion, and finetuned models showing robustness up to 60%.

Conclusion: The research highlights the value of tailored training augmentations and further studies into patch-level sensitivity to improve deployment robustness in occluded military environments.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

*Gowreesh Mago,Pascal Mettes,Stevan Rudinac*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper highlights advancements in video content understanding, focusing on abstract concept recognition, an area machines find challenging compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automated video understanding by addressing the challenge of recognizing abstract concepts, aligning machine reasoning with human values.

Method: Surveying past tasks, datasets, and approaches while contextualizing these efforts in the current era of multi-modal foundation models.

Result: Observations show frequent yet fragmented attempts over decades to solve abstract concept recognition, with opportunities to integrate these learnings systematically.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes leveraging past advancements alongside current foundation models to solve the grand challenge of abstract concept understanding in video content.

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Amila Akagić,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new explainability method for skin lesion classification, addressing limitations in current approaches and enhancing diagnostic reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High distrust in AI diagnostic methods necessitates the development of explainable and reliable classification systems for skin lesion diagnosis.

Method: The study proposes a method called Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, which analyzes activation probability maps for all classes probabilistically at the pixel level, along with the integration of SafeML for enhanced false diagnosis detection.

Result: The proposed method was tested on ISIC datasets using MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformers, proving effective in improving diagnostic reliability and explanation.

Conclusion: The innovations contribute to making AI-based skin lesion diagnostics more trustworthy and safer for medical use, ultimately increasing patient safety.

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

### [144] [Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20783)
*Beth Pearson,Bilal Boulbarss,Michael Wray,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether generative Diffusion Classifiers perform better than discriminative Vision-Language Models (VLMs), like CLIP and ViLT, at compositional generalization tasks. Results show mixed performance, with significant challenges in relational reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the limitations of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP, which struggle with compositional semantics despite advancements in vision-language tasks.

Method: The study evaluates three models—Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT—on their ability to associate object attributes and relations in zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised zero-shot learning (GZSL) scenarios.

Result: The Diffusion Classifier and ViLT perform better on object-attribute binding tasks but all studied models exhibit poor performance in relational GZSL tasks due to challenges in relational reasoning, such as distinguishing concepts like left and right.

Conclusion: The findings highlight compositional and relational reasoning as critical challenges for VLMs, necessitating further research in these areas to improve model performance.

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

### [145] [ChainReaction! Structured Approach with Causal Chains as Intermediate Representations for Improved and Explainable Causal Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21010)
*Paritosh Parmar,Eric Peh,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular framework for Causal-Why Video Question Answering that enhances interpretability and higher-order reasoning using natural language causal chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for Causal-Why VideoQA struggle with opaque pipelines and limited interpretability, relying on shallow heuristics for causal reasoning.

Method: The framework employs a two-stage architecture: a Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) to generate causal chains and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) to provide answers. It also includes scalable annotations with large language models and introduces a new metric for causality evaluation.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy, explainability, user trust, and generalization.

Conclusion: The modular design successfully separates causal reasoning and answer generation, demonstrating the CCE's potential as a domain-reusable engine for causal reasoning.

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

### [146] [Surfel-based 3D Registration with Equivariant SE(3) Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20789)
*Xueyang Kang,Hang Zhao,Kourosh Khoshelham,Patrick Vandewalle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a surfel-based pose learning approach to enhance 3D point cloud registration by leveraging SE(3) equivariant features, addressing issues of noise, rotation sensitivity, and transformation augmentation reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud registration methods often disregard point uncertainty and orientation, leaving them vulnerable to noisy input and aggressive rotations, as well as requiring extensive training augmentation. This paper seeks to overcome these limitations.

Method: The authors propose a method utilizing surfels initialized via virtual perspective camera parameters and SE(3) equivariant convolutional features to predict 3D pose transformations. The model incorporates an equivariant convolutional encoder, cross-attention mechanism, fully-connected decoder, and Huber loss.

Result: Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness in real-world scans.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves point cloud registration by addressing noise and rotation challenges with its novel use of SE(3) equivariant features and surfels, offering superior performance across datasets.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

### [147] [Adapting Foundation Model for Dental Caries Detection with Dual-View Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20813)
*Tao Luo,Han Wu,Tong Yang,Dinggang Shen,Zhiming Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVCTNet is a novel deep learning method designed to improve dental caries detection accuracy from panoramic X-rays. It utilizes dual-view inputs and innovative cross-view feature fusion for enhanced results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations in dental caries detection methods, which often struggle with subtle contrast differences and diverse lesion morphology.

Method: The proposed approach, DVCTNet, employs dual-view co-training using both global views from panoramic X-rays and local views from cropped tooth images. It incorporates a Gated Cross-View Attention module to fuse features dynamically.

Result: DVCTNet showed superior performance compared to existing SOTA methods on both a public dataset and a newly curated dataset with high-precision annotations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that DVCTNet provides a clinically applicable solution for accurate dental caries detection, advancing the field with publicly available code and dataset resources.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

### [148] [FusionCounting: Robust visible-infrared image fusion guided by crowd counting via multi-task learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20817)
*He Li,Xinyu Liu,Weihang Kong,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionCounting introduces a multi-task framework combining visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) with crowd counting, improving population density estimation and image fusion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VIF methods mainly focus on image quality optimization, but integrating downstream tasks, like crowd counting, can provide semantic benefits. Crowd counting avoids challenges seen in object detection and semantic segmentation by requiring minimal annotation and being effective in dense scenes.

Method: FusionCounting leverages input images and population density information through a shared multi-task learning design. It employs dynamic loss function weighting for balanced optimization and adversarial training to enhance robustness.

Result: Experimentation on public datasets confirms that FusionCounting improves both image fusion quality and crowd counting accuracy.

Conclusion: FusionCounting demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating crowd counting into the VIF process, addressing limitations in current methods and offering dual-task improvements.

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel pipeline for 2D surgical tool keypoint estimation using Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine-tuned with LoRA, achieving better performance than traditional approaches in low-resource scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the overfitting issues in traditional methods due to small medical datasets by using pre-trained VLMs, leveraging their generalization ability.

Method: The methodology involves fine-tuning VLMs using LoRA, designing specific prompts to align visual features with semantic keypoint descriptions, and creating an instruction-tuning dataset.

Result: The adapted VLM outperformed baseline models after just two epochs of fine-tuning, showcasing the effectiveness of this method in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: The approach not only enhances 2D keypoint detection for surgical tools but also highlights its potential for future advancements in 3D pose estimation of surgical hands and tools.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

*Hao Yang,Qianyu Zhou,Haijia Sun,Xiangtai Li,Xuequan Lu,Lizhuang Ma,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PointDGRWKV, a new framework leveraging RWKV architecture to improve domain generalization in point cloud classification. Key innovations include Adaptive Geometric Token Shift and Cross-Domain Distribution Alignment to address challenges in spatial modeling and cross-domain robustness, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in enhancing the generalizability of point cloud classification models to unseen domains. Existing solutions are hindered by issues like limited receptive fields, high computational costs, or inadequate long-range dependency modeling. RWKV's potential to overcome these weaknesses motivates its exploration in this field.

Method: The authors propose PointDGRWKV, an RWKV-based framework with two novel modules: Adaptive Geometric Token Shift for enhanced spatial modeling and improved geometric context awareness, and Cross-Domain Key Feature Distribution Alignment to reduce attention drift by aligning key distributions across domains.

Result: PointDGRWKV demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple domain generalization benchmarks for point cloud classification, addressing limitations of both existing methods and the RWKV architecture when directly applied.

Conclusion: PointDGRWKV successfully adapts RWKV for domain generalization in point cloud classification by addressing both spatial distortion and cross-domain attention challenges, proving its robustness and efficiency while delivering superior results.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

TL;DR: The paper presents PathMR, a cell-level multimodal visual reasoning framework for pathological image analysis, which improves diagnostic explanations and cell distribution predictions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited clinical adoption of deep learning models in pathology due to their opaque decisions and lack of interpretable rationale.

Method: PathMR employs a unified multimodal framework that generates segmentation masks and textual explanations relating to pathological images and textual queries. It also predicts cell distribution patterns.

Result: PathMR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment based on evaluations on the PathGen and GADVR datasets.

Conclusion: PathMR has the potential to enhance interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnoses, facilitating its adoption in clinical practice.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning framework for early pancreatic cancer detection using dual-modality imaging and achieves over 90% accuracy with a ResNet-based model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the urgent need for early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), given its low survival rate and late-stage diagnoses.

Method: The study reviewed six deep learning architectures, including CNNs and Vision Transformers, and developed a ResNet-based neural network on limited patient samples with class-weighted training and frozen pre-trained layers.

Result: The optimized model achieved over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissues, outperforming manual analysis methods.

Conclusion: The framework is a significant stride towards clinical deployment for automated PDAC detection and offers insights into applying deep learning on small medical datasets while setting a foundation for application to other cancer types.

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

*Pushkar Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores counterfactual frameworks to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in AI models, particularly vision classifiers and generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address interpretability and fairness issues in AI models by using counterfactual reasoning to uncover biases and spurious correlations.

Method: Develops tools like CAVLI, ASAC, TIBET, BiasConnect, and InterMit that utilize counterfactual analysis to audit and mitigate biases in AI.

Result: The frameworks effectively identify biases, probe causal dependencies, and improve fairness and accuracy in AI models.

Conclusion: Counterfactual reasoning establishes scalable and principled methods for socially responsible bias evaluation and mitigation in AI models.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Motivation: Improve medical image segmentation by effectively transferring the rich semantic representations of natural image foundation models for clinical use.

Method: Propose Dino U-Net architecture with a frozen DINOv3 backbone, semantic-spatial fusion adapter, and Fidelity-Aware Projection Module (FAPM) to refine features during dimensionality reduction.

Result: Experiments on seven medical segmentation datasets showed Dino U-Net achieving state-of-the-art performance, with accuracy improving as model size scales up to 7 billion parameters.

Conclusion: Using dense-pretrained features from vision foundation models proves highly scalable, effective, and efficient for medical image segmentation, achieving superior accuracy across modalities.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Conclusion: Deep ensemble models are effective for AMF classification, though rule-based refinement shows potential for specific improvements but requires further optimization.

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces E-ConvNeXt, a lightweight, high-performance neural network derived from ConvNeXt by incorporating Cross Stage Partial Connections and other optimizations, achieving notable accuracy-efficiency balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many high-performance networks are limited in lightweight application scenarios because they were not originally designed for such conditions, creating the need for a more resource-efficient network.

Method: The authors integrate Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with ConvNeXt, reduce network complexity by up to 80%, optimize the Stem and Block structures, and replace Layer Scale with channel attention for improved performance and efficiency.

Result: E-ConvNeXt achieves high accuracy-efficiency trade-offs: 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at 0.9GFLOPs (mini version) and 81.9% at 3.1GFLOPs (small version) on ImageNet, with strong generalization shown in transfer learning for object detection tasks.

Conclusion: E-ConvNeXt effectively reduces computational complexity while maintaining or even improving classification accuracy and demonstrates its adaptability across various tasks, making it suitable for lightweight applications.

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized
designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy
performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental
validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior
accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at
0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer
learning tests on object detection tasks further confirm its generalization
capability.

### [159] [Webly-Supervised Image Manipulation Localization via Category-Aware Auto-Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20987)
*Chenfan Qu,Yiwu Zhong,Bin Li,Lianwen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the issue of localizing manipulated regions in images, introducing methods that leverage web data for creating a large-scale annotated dataset (MIMLv2) and a model (Web-IML) to improve detection accuracy. Results show significant performance gains compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulated images pose risks to social security, yet identifying the altered regions is challenging due to the lack of high-quality annotated datasets.

Method: The authors collected web data for manually forged images and automated annotations via CAAAv2 and QES. They proposed Object Jitter for improved model training and introduced Web-IML, a model leveraging web-scale supervision.

Result: Their dataset, MIMLv2, is over 120x larger than existing datasets, and their model, Web-IML, achieves an average IoU improvement of 24.1 over previous methods and a 31% performance gain in forgery benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods mitigate data scarcity, improve manipulation detection accuracy significantly, and provide publicly available resources for advancing this field.

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/qcf-568/MIML.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExpertSim explains a simulation model for particle detector responses in CERN, leveraging a deep-learning architecture to improve simulation precision and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Monte Carlo simulations for particle detectors in CERN are computationally expensive and not efficient enough for varied data distributions.

Method: Proposed ExpertSim using the Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where individual models specialize in a subset of the data for tailored simulations.

Result: ExpertSim offers improved accuracy and greater computational speed compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods.

Conclusion: ExpertSim provides a promising, high-efficiency solution for detector simulations, enhancing both precision and speed. Code is openly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

*Jiaxiang Cheng,Bing Ma,Xuhua Ren,Hongyi Jin,Kai Yu,Peng Zhang,Wenyue Li,Yuan Zhou,Tianxiang Zheng,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POSE drastically enhances video diffusion generation by reducing sampling steps, allowing high-quality videos in a single step, with a 100x latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies in sampling for large-scale video diffusion models and improve temporal coherence.

Method: Proposes a two-phase distillation framework combining stability priming, adversarial equilibrium, and conditional adversarial consistency.

Result: POSE improves semantic alignment, temporal coherence, and frame quality by 7.15%, and reduces latency from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds.

Conclusion: POSE enables faster and highly efficient single-step video generation models while maintaining quality.

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational efficiency improvement for text-to-image diffusion models by reducing redundancy across correlated prompts, using semantic clustering and sharing computation during early diffusion steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models offer impressive image generation capabilities but are computationally expensive, highlighting the need for approaches to reduce costs and optimize efficiency, especially for large-scale applications.

Method: The authors propose a training-free method that clusters prompts based on semantic similarity and reuses computation during the early steps of diffusion for correlated prompts, enhancing efficiency and image quality using UnClip's text-to-image prior.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that their method reduces computational cost and improves image quality for models conditioned on image embeddings, achieving greater efficiency without additional training requirements.

Conclusion: The method reduces environmental and financial burdens of large-scale text-to-image generation. It integrates with existing pipelines, scales effectively, and optimizes computational resources while enhancing image generation quality.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses mitosis detection in histopathological images under domain shift, proposing a Mamba-based approach utilizing VM-UNet and stain augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve mitosis detection in histopathology images while addressing the performance drop due to domain shifts in machine learning models.

Method: They use a Mamba-based approach with a VM-UNet architecture and stain augmentation to enhance model robustness against domain variations.

Result: Preliminary experiments on the MIDOG++ dataset indicate significant scope for improving the proposed method.

Conclusion: While the approach shows promise, more work is needed to fully address the challenges of domain shift in mitosis detection.

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help physicians assess tumor aggressiveness accurately by addressing performance degradation in machine learning models under domain shift conditions.

Method: Utilizing multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks correlated to the primary classification task, enabling the model to focus on the object of interest while ignoring domain-varying image backgrounds.

Result: The approach demonstrated promising performance across three datasets: MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training Set, Ami-Br dataset, and the MIDOG25 challenge preliminary test set.

Conclusion: Multi-task learning can effectively address domain shift issues in mitotic figure recognition tasks, providing a pathway for improved tumor classification models.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FW-GAN is a handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, style-consistent text from a single sample, addressing challenges in long-range dependencies and frequency information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled handwriting data limits the effectiveness of handwriting recognition systems and necessitates methods to generate diverse, artificial training samples.

Method: FW-GAN employs a phase-aware Wave-MLP generator for spatial relationships, a frequency-guided discriminator for authenticity, and a Frequency Distribution Loss to align synthetic and real handwriting frequency characteristics.

Result: Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting datasets show that FW-GAN generates high-quality, visually accurate, and style-consistent handwriting, ideal for augmenting low-resource HTR pipelines.

Conclusion: FW-GAN effectively overcomes limitations in existing handwriting synthesis approaches by leveraging frequency information and advanced modeling, proving to be beneficial for handwriting recognition systems.

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) face computational challenges from excessive visual tokens. MMG-Vid resolves this with training-free token pruning methods, cutting tokens by 75% and accelerating processes without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve inefficiencies in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs), which struggle with computational costs due to redundant visual tokens and the complexity of multi-frame video understanding.

Method: The paper introduces MMG-Vid, a framework that prunes visual tokens without training by optimizing redundancy removal at both segment-level and token-level, using marginal gain and temporal-guided algorithms.

Result: MMG-Vid reduces visual tokens by 75%, accelerates the prefilling stage by 3.9x, and maintains over 99.5% of the original video understanding performance.

Conclusion: MMG-Vid is highly effective in balancing efficiency and performance for VLLMs, presenting a significant advancement in video token optimization techniques.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

TL;DR: HydraFake introduces a new dataset mimicking real-world deepfake challenges, while Veritas, a large language model-based detector, incorporates human-like reasoning for improved detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection benchmarks fail to replicate the diverse and complex challenges of real-world forgeries.

Method: HydraFake combines diversified techniques and rigorous protocols, while Veritas uses multi-modal reasoning patterns like planning and self-reflection in a two-stage training pipeline.

Result: Veritas outperforms prior detectors in unseen forgery and cross-data domain scenarios as evaluated on HydraFake.

Conclusion: The proposed tools significantly enhance generalization and transparency in deepfake detection, paving the way for stronger practical applications.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'FakeParts,' a type of deepfake focusing on subtle, localized manipulations. It also presents 'FakePartsBench,' a large-scale benchmark dataset to improve detection methods for such manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake technology poses a challenge with its evolving capabilities, and partial manipulations, which are harder to detect than fully synthetic ones, expose a significant gap in existing detection frameworks.

Method: Developed a labeled benchmark dataset, 'FakePartsBench,' with over 25,000 videos containing both pixel-level and frame-level manipulation annotations. Conducted user studies and tested detection models on this dataset.

Result: Results show that the newly introduced 'FakeParts' deepfakes reduce human detection accuracy by over 30%, with similar accuracy drops seen in state-of-the-art detection models.

Conclusion: Current detection methods are inadequate against such partial manipulations, and the work highlights the necessity of building more adaptable detection systems aided by the resources provided with FakePartsBench.

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven multi-view 3D point tracking solution, addressing tracking in dynamic scenes using fewer cameras without extensive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for point tracking use either single cameras, which face depth and occlusion issues, or multiple cameras requiring tedious optimization and numerous devices. The authors aim to simplify and improve tracking ability under practical camera setups.

Method: The solution uses known camera poses and multi-view depth, fusing multi-view features into a point cloud. It leverages k-nearest-neighbors correlation along with a transformer-based approach to estimate long-range 3D correspondences robustly.

Result: When evaluated on benchmarks like Panoptic Studio and DexYCB, the method achieved impressive median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, demonstrating its robustness across varying setups and conditions.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a pioneering multi-view approach to 3D tracking, offering robust, scalable solutions that generalize across different scenarios while becoming a benchmark tool for research and applications.

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning framework utilizing a single vision-language model for multi-task generative tasks, avoiding task-specific fine-tuning and demonstrating superior performance over competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance generative capabilities across diverse tasks and evaluation criteria using a single unified framework without relying on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Method: The paper develops OneReward, employing a vision-language model (VLM) as a generative reward system for mask-guided image generation, and trains a model via multi-task reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base.

Result: Experimental results show the unified edit model consistently outperforms commercial and open-source competitors like Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro] across multiple evaluation criteria.

Conclusion: OneReward proves as a robust and efficient framework for multi-task generation models offering significant improvement in both generalization and performance, while eliminating dependency on task-specific fine-tuning (SFT).

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

Abstract: We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high
quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a
user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference
video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,
bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms

### [172] [First-Place Solution to NeurIPS 2024 Invisible Watermark Removal Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21072)
*Fahad Shamshad,Tameem Bakr,Yahia Shaaban,Noor Hussein,Karthik Nandakumar,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the winning solution for a NeurIPS 2024 challenge aimed at testing the robustness of content watermarking methods against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and stress-test the resilience of image watermarking methods against adversarial attacks, thereby identifying vulnerabilities in current watermarking techniques.

Method: For the beige-box track, a VAE-based evasion attack was utilized with test-time optimization and color restoration in CIELAB space. For the black-box track, images were clustered based on artifacts before applying diffusion models with noise injection and semantic guidance from ChatGPT captions.

Result: The proposed methods achieved near-perfect watermark removal, with a 95.7% success rate and minimal quality degradation of the modified images.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant vulnerabilities in current watermarking methods and underscores the need for more resilient watermarking techniques.

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

### [173] [SpeedMalloc: Improving Multi-threaded Applications via a Lightweight Core for Memory Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20253)
*Ruihao Li,Qinzhe Wu,Krishna Kavi,Gayatri Mehta,Jonathan C. Beard,Neeraja J. Yadwadkar,Lizy K. John*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpeedMalloc, a memory allocator using a lightweight support-core to offload multi-threaded memory tasks, achieving up to 1.75x performance improvements over top allocators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory allocation impacts overall program performance due to cache pollution and synchronization overhead in multi-threaded systems.

Method: SpeedMalloc leverages a lightweight support-core with dedicated metadata caches and efficient cross-core synchronization, avoiding cache conflicts and supporting flexible allocator designs.

Result: SpeedMalloc outperformed prominent allocators, achieving speedups of 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x across various workloads.

Conclusion: By offloading memory allocation tasks to a general-purpose support-core, SpeedMalloc effectively mitigates performance bottlenecks and caters to new allocator designs, enhancing efficiency in multi-threaded applications.

Abstract: Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed
code, can have a "butterfly effect" on overall program performance, leading to
significant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately
5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x
performance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from
the complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core
systems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading
to cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.
Offloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a
potential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache
pollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for
multi-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators
remains a significant challenge.
  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory
allocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a
lightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data
synchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This
design minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for
cross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core
instead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting
new allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software
and hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and
Memento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on
multithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.

*Arya Tschand,Muhammad Awad,Ryan Swann,Kesavan Ramakrishnan,Jeffrey Ma,Keith Lowery,Ganesh Dasika,Vijay Janapa Reddi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SwizzlePerf improves GPU kernel performance engineering by enabling hardware-awareness in LLMs, achieving faster results and significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based kernel optimization methods rely on inefficient runtime-based searches and lack hardware-awareness, which is crucial for optimal performance.

Method: SwizzlePerf incorporates specific hardware details such as memory patterns, architecture specs, and profiling logs into LLMs to generate spatial optimizations for GPU kernels.

Result: SwizzlePerf matches human-engineered optimizations for GEMM kernels in under 5 minutes and improves speed and cache efficiency significantly in 9 out of 10 tested kernels.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of hardware-aware LLMs in optimizing GPU performance and sets a foundation for future development in the field.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM
performance engineering agents.

TL;DR: The paper addresses tail latency issues in A100 GPU clusters used for latency-sensitive tasks, introducing a host-level controller for better performance under shared infrastructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aimed to tackle the problem of tail latency increases and service-level objective (SLO) violations caused by noisy-neighbor interference in shared A100 GPU clusters.

Method: The solution combines dynamic Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) reconfiguration, PCIe-aware placement, and lightweight guardrails (such as quotas and cgroup I/O). The system samples per-tenant latencies, avoids PCIe congestion using topology insights, and includes mechanisms to prevent operational thrashing.

Result: Experiments conducted in a single host and 2-node cluster showed a \\approx 32% SLO miss-rate reduction, \\approx 15% p99 latency improvement, and maintained throughput costs below 5% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively reduces latency and improves performance stability with minimal trade-offs, even when handling large language models like OLMo 2 7B Instruct, proving its generalized effectiveness.

Abstract: Latency-sensitive inference on shared A100 clusters often suffers
noisy-neighbor interference on the PCIe fabric, inflating tail latency and SLO
violations. We present a fabric-agnostic, VM-deployable host-level controller
that combines dynamic Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) reconfiguration, PCIe-aware
placement, and lightweight guardrails (MPS quotas, cgroup I/O). It samples
per-tenant tails and system signals, uses topology hints to avoid PCIe hot
spots, and gates actions with dwell/cool-down to avoid thrash. On a single host
and a 2-node (16-GPU) cluster, SLO miss-rate is reduced by \(\approx\)32\%
(\(\approx\)1.5) and p99 latency improves \(\approx\)15\% with \(\leq\)5\%
throughput cost versus static MIG and naive placement; ablations show MIG and
placement contribute comparably. We also evaluate LLM serving with vLLM on OLMo
2 7B Instruct: TTFT p99 improves \(\approx\)10--15\% at \(\leq\)5\% cost
without changing the controller.

*Guanyu Xu,Zhiwei Hao,Li Shen,Yong Luo,Fuhui Sun,Xiaoyan Wang,Han Hu,Yonggang Wen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoFormer, a collaborative inference system for transformer models, aimed at enhancing edge device performance while reducing latency, memory, and energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices struggle with deploying transformer models due to computational demands and resource constraints, making it challenging to maintain real-time, high-quality service.

Method: CoFormer decomposes large transformer models into smaller components for distributed inference, aggregates results, and uses optimization (DeBo algorithm) to balance latency and accuracy for heterogeneous hardware.

Result: CoFormer achieves up to 3.1× inference speedup, reduces GPT2-XL memory requirements by 76.3%, and decreases energy consumption by ~40%, retaining effective inference performance.

Conclusion: CoFormer presents a viable solution for deploying large transformer models efficiently on edge devices by leveraging model decomposition and optimization, balancing accuracy, latency, and resource demands.

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

*Tiancheng Zhao,Zekun Yin,Huihai An,Xiaoyu Yang,Zhou Jin,Jiasi Shen,Helen Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces pdGRASS, a parallel algorithm for graph spectral sparsification, offering improved performance, scalability, and single-pass edge recovery compared to the existing feGRASS method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in feGRASS, including difficulty in parallelizing edge recovery and degraded performance on skewed inputs, by creating a scalable and efficient parallel method.

Method: pdGRASS organizes edges into disjoint subtasks without data dependencies, enabling efficient parallelization and single-pass edge recovery.

Result: pdGRASS achieves speedups of 3.9x to 8.8x on average, mitigates worst-case runtimes with over 1000x speedup, and improves sparsifier quality in terms of preconditioned conjugate gradient iteration counts.

Conclusion: pdGRASS is an effective solution to overcome feGRASS' challenges, significantly enhancing scalability and computational efficiency for graph spectral sparsification applications.

Abstract: Graph Spectral Sparsification (GSS) identifies an ultra-sparse subgraph, or
sparsifier, whose Laplacian matrix closely approximates the spectral properties
of the original graph, enabling substantial reductions in computational
complexity for computationally intensive problems in scientific computing. The
state-of-the-art method for efficient GSS is feGRASS, consisting of two steps:
1) spanning tree generation and 2) off-tree edge recovery. However, feGRASS
suffers from two main issues: 1) difficulties in parallelizing the recovery
step for strict data dependencies, and 2) performance degradation on skewed
inputs, often requiring multiple passes to recover sufficient edges. To address
these challenges, we propose parallel density-aware Graph Spectral
Sparsification (pdGRASS), a parallel algorithm that organizes edges into
disjoint subtasks without data dependencies between them, enabling efficient
parallelization and sufficient edge recovery in a single pass. We empirically
evaluate feGRASS and pdGRASS based on 1) off-tree edge-recovery runtime and 2)
sparsifier quality, measured by the iteration count required for convergence in
a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) application. The evaluation
demonstrates that, depending on the number of edges recovered, pdGRASS achieves
average speedups ranging from 3.9x to 8.8x. The resulting sparsifiers also show
between 1.2x higher and 1.8x lower PCG iteration counts, with further
improvements as more edges are recovered. Additionally, pdGRASS mitigates the
worst-case runtimes of feGRASS with over 1000x speedup. These results highlight
pdGRASS's significant improvements in scalability and performance for the graph
spectral sparsification problem.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent service optimization framework using graph learning and game-driven policy mechanisms to enhance governance of microservice architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address critical governance challenges, such as dynamic workloads and complex dependencies, in large-scale microservice systems.

Method: The method involves modeling services as agents, using graph learning for dependency mapping, applying Markov Decision Processes, centralized training with decentralized execution, and game-driven policy optimization.

Result: Experimental results indicate significant improvements in coordination, adaptability, and stability of microservice systems compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The approach enhances governance efficiency, achieves operational stability, and proves valuable for real-world applications in microservice architecture management.

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent service optimization method based on a
multi-agent collaborative evolution mechanism to address governance challenges
in large-scale microservice architectures. These challenges include complex
service dependencies, dynamic topology structures, and fluctuating workloads.
The method models each service as an agent and introduces graph representation
learning to construct a service dependency graph. This enables agents to
perceive and embed structural changes within the system. Each agent learns its
policy based on a Markov Decision Process. A centralized training and
decentralized execution framework is used to integrate local autonomy with
global coordination. To enhance overall system performance and adaptability, a
game-driven policy optimization mechanism is designed. Through a
selection-mutation process, agent strategy distributions are dynamically
adjusted. This supports adaptive collaboration and behavioral evolution among
services. Under this mechanism, the system can quickly respond and achieve
stable policy convergence when facing scenarios such as sudden workload spikes,
topology reconfigurations, or resource conflicts. To evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a representative
microservice simulation platform. Comparative analyses are performed against
several advanced approaches, focusing on coordination efficiency, adaptability,
and policy convergence performance. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms others in several key metrics. It significantly improves
governance efficiency and operational stability in large-scale microservice
systems. The method demonstrates strong practical value and engineering
feasibility.

TL;DR: CrystalICL is a novel approach for few-shot crystal generation, outperforming existing methods by utilizing advanced tokenization and tuning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of existing methods that fail to leverage few-shot in-context learning capabilities for designing crystal materials.

Method: The study introduces a space-group based tokenization, a hybrid instruction tuning framework, and a multi-task strategy to enhance few-shot learning for crystal generation.

Result: Extensive evaluations across four benchmarks show that CrystalICL outperforms current baseline methods in both conditional and unconditional crystal generation.

Conclusion: CrystalICL demonstrates significant improvements in designing crystals by utilizing few-shot in-context learning strategies, highlighting its potential in advancing materials science.

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

*Elisha Dayag,Nhat Thanh Van Tran,Jack Xin*

TL;DR: Transformer-based models face challenges in long time-series forecasting due to biases towards low frequencies and computational demands. This study introduces learnable frequency filters to enhance performance and reduce resource needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases towards low-frequency data and high resource requirements in transformer-based models for long time-series forecasting.

Method: The paper proposes adding learnable frequency filters at the start of transformer-based models, increasing their spectral utilization with minimal additional parameters (~1000).

Result: Learnable filters improve forecasting performance by 5-10% and enable reduction in embedding dimensions, making transformer models both smaller and more effective.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models with learnable filters show enhanced forecasting ability, improved utilization of the spectral range, and reduced resource demands, making them a more efficient alternative.

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge classical nonlinear filtering theory with modern inference architectures like transformers.

Method: Development of a novel probabilistic interpretation of transformer operations as surrogates of conditional measures and fixed-point updates, with details shown for a hidden Markov model (HMM).

Result: Proposed a theoretical framework connecting HMM-based filtering methods to transformer architectures.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into the parallels between classical filtering methods and transformer-based architectures, offering a deeper understanding of the operational mechanisms of transformers.

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In

TL;DR: The paper investigates the importance of a teacher model's calibration error in improving the performance of knowledge distillation and proposes a method to enhance it through calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore factors that improve student model performance in Knowledge Distillation and identify the role of a teacher model's calibration error.

Method: The authors analyze the correlation between teacher model calibration error and student model accuracy, and propose using a calibration method to reduce teacher model errors.

Result: Demonstrated that reducing the teacher's calibration error improves KD performance across tasks like classification and detection.

Conclusion: Teacher model calibration is critical for effective knowledge distillation, and the proposed approach, easily integrable with other methods, yields consistent performance improvements.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

*Johnson Zhou,Joseph West,Krista A. Ehinger,Zhenming Ren,Sam E. John,David B. Grayden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CTXSEG, an adaptive EEG segmentation method, and demonstrates its superiority over fixed-length segmentation for machine learning tasks, specifically for seizure detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to overcome the limitations of arbitrary fixed-length EEG signal segmentations which lack biological relevance, proposing a more adaptive solution.

Method: The authors developed CTXSEG, an adaptive segmentation method based on statistical differences in EEG data, along with CTXGEN, a synthetic data generator. CTXSEG was validated in EEG seizure detection tasks.

Result: Using CTXSEG improved seizure detection performance compared to fixed-length segmentation approaches without altering machine learning methodologies and required fewer data segments.

Conclusion: Adaptive segmentation methods like CTXSEG offer a significant advantage for EEG data preprocessing and should be integrated into standard practices for machine learning applications.

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Correlation of Loss Differences" (CLD), a simple yet effective coreset selection method for optimizing training datasets by leveraging trajectory-based alignment with validation losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges of training deep learning models in resource-constrained or real-time scenarios while maintaining high performance.

Method: CLD identifies impactful training samples by measuring the alignment of their loss trajectories with those from a validation set. It uses a lightweight approach, relying on loss values computed during training without requiring costly gradient or curvature computations.

Result: Experiments on datasets like CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k show that CLD-based coresets perform comparably or better than state-of-the-art techniques while being significantly computationally efficient. The method generalizes across architectures and performs well even with early training checkpoints.

Conclusion: CLD offers a principled, efficient, and transferable approach to dataset optimization, with robust performance and inherent bias reduction across multiple scenarios and models.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance equation discovery in complex dynamics and compare machine learning symbolic regression methods for real-world applications.

Method: Five symbolic regression methods were tested on nine dynamic processes, including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models.

Result: PySR outperformed other methods, demonstrating high accuracy and strong predictive power, even matching original analytical forms in some cases.

Conclusion: Symbolic regression, particularly PySR, is a promising tool for inferring and modeling complex real-world phenomena.

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics

epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

*Firooz Shahriari-Mehr,Javad Aliakbari,Alexandre Graell i Amat,Ashkan Panahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes transductive node classification in graphs with community structures aligning with labels and features. It proposes an optimization framework leveraging node-specific data and demonstrates its advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for better integration of graph structure and node-specific information in transductive node classification tasks.

Method: A spectral graph clustering-based optimization framework is introduced, incorporating node-specific data like labels and features.

Result: The proposed framework guarantees accurate community recovery under relaxed conditions compared to traditional graph clustering. Experiments support this claim.

Conclusion: The study establishes that combining graph structure with node-specific information improves community recovery in classification problems.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

### [187] [Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20333)
*Md Abdullah Al Mamun,Ihsen Alouani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how adversaries can exploit the alignment mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) to covertly enforce bias or targeted censorship using a poisoning attack called Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to highlight potential vulnerabilities in the alignment mechanisms of LLMs, which could allow adversaries to bypass ethical safeguards and inject harmful biases or censorship.

Method: The authors propose and implement Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that manipulates the alignment mechanism of LLMs to induce refusal responses on specific topics or queries, which cannot be easily detected by state-of-the-art defenses.

Result: SAI is demonstrated to introduce significant bias in LLM-powered applications. For example, in a healthcare chatbot, 1% data poisoning causes refusal to healthcare inquiries for a specific racial group, leading to a bias difference of 23%. In other applications, induced biases reached up to 38%.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current defenses against poisoning attacks in LLM settings can be insufficient to detect or prevent bias implants like those introduced by SAI, raising important concerns about the security of LLM-based systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

*Ralph Bulanadi,Jawad Chowdhury,Funakubo Hiroshi,Maxim Ziatdinov,Rama Vasudevan,Arpan Biswas,Yongtao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces INS2ANE, a framework improving autonomous experiments to explore novel phenomena using novelty scoring and strategic sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve autonomous experiments by addressing their limitation of focusing solely on predefined targets, hindering the discovery of unexpected phenomena.

Method: INS2ANE combines a novelty scoring system to evaluate result uniqueness and a strategic sampling mechanism to explore under-sampled experimental regions.

Result: INS2ANE successfully increased the diversity of explored phenomena in tests with a known dataset and physical experiments on scanning probe microscopy.

Conclusion: INS2ANE amplifies the potential of autonomous experiments, allowing both novel discovery and efficient research navigation in complex experimental spaces.

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

*Neta Shoham,Haim Avron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces algorithms for exact stochastic inference in Gaussian Processes (GPs) using kernels in finite dimensional RKHS and presents superior experimental results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stochastic hyperparameter learning in GPs often relies on methods that approximate solutions, which may fail to converge to the true marginal likelihood. This highlights the need for better techniques that achieve exact solutions or provide superior results.

Method: The authors propose stochastic inference algorithms designed for GPs with kernels associated with RKHS of moderate finite dimensions and offer an approximate extension for infinite-dimensional cases.

Result: The method surpasses existing techniques in experimental scenarios where memory imposes strict limitations on batch size and the number of inducing points.

Conclusion: The proposed approach delivers improved empirical outcomes in constrained computing environments and provides exact solutions for finite dimensional RKHS-based GPs.

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

*Debabrota Basu,Sourav Chakraborty,Debarshi Chanda,Buddha Dev Das,Arijit Ghosh,Arnab Ray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task-specific algorithm to assess the credibility of survey data for regression models, achieving efficiency by avoiding data dimensionality constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Survey data often need to be verified to ensure the reliability of research outcomes, which involves high-dimensional distribution comparisons. Traditional methods require large sample sizes, posing computational challenges.

Method: A task-based approach is introduced with a model-specific distance metric and an efficient algorithm to verify survey credibility in regression contexts, bypassing the need to reconstruct the regression model.

Result: The proposed algorithm operates with sample complexity independent of data dimension, contrasting with linear scaling required by reconstruction methods. Simulations validate theoretical correctness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper presents an efficient, theoretically sound method for verifying survey credibility in regression models, significantly reducing sample size dependencies on data dimensions.

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces the TV-HSGT algorithm for distributed online optimization in time-varying directed networks, with improved dynamic regret without bounded gradient assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in current distributed online optimization methods, which often depend on bounded gradient assumptions and ignore stochastic gradients in dynamic networks.

Method: The proposed TV-HSGT algorithm utilizes hybrid stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms, integrating row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes over time-varying digraphs. It incorporates current and recursive stochastic gradients for variance reduction and accurate global descent tracking.

Result: TV-HSGT achieves improved dynamic regret bounds while overcoming the reliance on gradient boundedness. Experiments confirm its effectiveness in logistic regression tasks under dynamic, resource-constrained conditions.

Conclusion: TV-HSGT successfully enhances distributed online optimization with robust performance under challenging conditions, offering theoretical and empirical advantages.

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

*Tetsuro Morimura,Tatsushi Oka,Yugo Suzuki,Daisuke Moriwaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper integrates latent variable modeling into the double machine learning (DML) framework for robust causal effect estimation, especially when hidden factors are present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hidden factors in observational data complicate causal inference, and current methods struggle with missing or unmeasured covariates.

Method: The framework applies DML with latent variable modeling, accounting for cases where latent variables affect either only the outcome or both treatment and outcome. Latent variables are incorporated specifically in the second DML stage.

Result: The proposed method was validated as robust and effective through experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: This new framework enhances causal inference techniques by effectively managing unobserved factors via latent variable modeling integrated with DML.

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in independent component analysis by incorporating multi-trial supervision to improve optimization reliability and interpretability.

Method: A proximal gradient-type algorithm for invertible matrices is blended with joint learning via backpropagation in a supervised framework.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real data show higher success rates in non-convex optimization and better interpretability of components.

Conclusion: Supervised multi-trial information can improve outcomes in independent component analysis, particularly for non-convex scenarios.

Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that
incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific
contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of
invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real
data experiments. In particular, owing to the additional supervision, we
observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the
improved interpretability of the independent components.

*Sam Houliston,Ambroise Odonnat,Charles Arnal,Vivien Cabannes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates the superiority of using tools such as external retrieval for factual recall compared to traditional memorization methods in language models by showing theoretical and empirical scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to understand the advantages of tool-augmented language models, particularly focusing on their ability to enhance factual recall through external retrieval, as opposed to relying solely on model parameters for memorization.

Method: The authors provide theoretical proofs and conduct controlled experiments to validate the benefits of tool-use (external retrieval) for unbounded factual recall, comparing it against in-weight learning (memorization).

Result: Tool-using models outperform memorizing ones in factual recall tasks, showcasing the scalability of tool-augmented approaches and the efficiency of teaching tool-use over finetuning facts into model weights.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented language models offer provable scalability advantages for factual recall over in-weight learning, suggesting that teaching tool-use and general rules is a more effective and practical approach for language model development.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

TL;DR: This systematic review highlights the transformative role of large language models (LLMs), notably transformer architectures, in advancing hereditary disease diagnostics and genetic education, though challenges remain in data integration and clinical application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches in genetics face limitations with complex, high-dimensional data, and the paper explores how LLMs can address these challenges to improve hereditary disease diagnostics and genetic education.

Method: The paper systematically analyzed 172 studies from databases like PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv, focusing on LLM applications in genomic variant interpretation, risk stratification, and imaging technologies, excluding irrelevant or outdated models.

Result: LLMs demonstrate significant progress in genomic variant identification, risk stratification, and medical imaging analysis, though struggles persist with integrating multimodal data and achieving clinical robustness.

Conclusion: LLMs have the potential to revolutionize genetic diagnostics and education, but achieving generalizability and practical clinical implementation remains a challenge.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

*Gil Goldshlager,Jiang Hu,Lin Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Subsampled Natural Gradient Descent (SNGD) and SPRING, providing theoretical insights and fast convergence guarantees for parametric optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subsampled Natural Gradient Descent has been effective in machine learning applications like neural network wavefunctions but lacks theoretical justification.

Method: Investigated SNGD and SPRING in linear optimization problems, drawing equivalences to regularized Kaczmarz methods and extending analyses for general convex quadratic losses.

Result: Provided the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, convergence guarantee for SPRING, and proof of SPRING accelerating SNGD.

Conclusion: The study bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical efficacy of SNGD using tools from randomized linear algebra.

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unpredictable local performance in neural networks that hinder reliability in critical applications.

Method: Investigating theoretical properties of VC, identifying tendencies in neural network behavior, introducing a new function distance metric, and proposing a preprocessing framework.

Result: Validated VC's properties and effectiveness through numerical results, real-world experiments, and scientific problem applications.

Conclusion: VC is a useful tool to understand and improve neural network approximation by quantifying local performance and stability, with practical enhancements in preprocessing.

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

*Shihao Zhang,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Beacon, an algorithm for per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) that eliminates manual scale tuning and achieves competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the process of selecting scaling factors in per-channel PTQ, which is traditionally done via manual tuning, grid searches, and complex methods.

Method: Beacon computes optimal scaling factors directly by leveraging the symmetry of scalar quantization. It avoids the need for back-propagation, large calibration datasets, or manual configuration.

Result: Beacon efficiently determines scaling factors and provides performance comparable to the best existing quantization techniques.

Conclusion: Beacon simplifies and automates the quantization process, making it a practical tool for deploying large pre-trained models efficiently.

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DALI, an enhanced Dreamer framework, for real-world reinforcement learning that adapts to unseen environments by utilizing latent context representations through a self-supervised encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptation to unseen environmental conditions in real-world reinforcement learning without explicit context variables or costly retraining remains a significant challenge.

Method: DALI employs a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics and generate actionable latent context representations, conditioning the world model and policy.

Result: DALI outperforms context-unaware baselines and often exceeds context-aware baselines on cMDP benchmarks, enabling zero-shot generalization to new contextual variations.

Conclusion: The DALI framework ensures efficient context inference, robust generalization, and counterfactual consistency, showcasing its effectiveness in dynamically adapting to latent or hard-to-measure contexts.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedReFT, a framework for Federated Learning utilizing Representation Fine-Tuning, achieving high parameter efficiency and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in applying Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) to Federated Learning due to client data and resource heterogeneity.

Method: FedReFT applies sparse intervention layers for hidden representation fine-tuning and uses the All-But-Me (ABM) aggregation strategy to mitigate semantic misalignment across clients.

Result: FedReFT achieves superior performance and 7x-15x higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based PEFT methods in various evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: FedReFT is effective for federated settings, offering lightweight and efficient fine-tuning while maintaining stable, personalized learning even with heterogeneous data and resources.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

### [203] [Multi-View Graph Convolution Network for Internal Talent Recommendation Based on Enterprise Emails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20328)
*Soo Hyun Kim,Jang-Hyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new internal talent recommendation method that utilizes employee email data to measure position fit based on task similarity (WHAT they do) and interaction patterns (HOW they work).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional internal talent recommendation methods rely heavily on limited managerial perspectives, making them prone to overlooking qualified candidates.

Method: The framework utilizes email data to model two key dimensions (task semantics and collaborative structure) as graphs, which are fused adaptively using a Dual Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism.

Result: The proposed method achieves a performance of 40.9% on Hit@100, outperforming other fusion strategies and demonstrating high interpretability by adapting fusion strategies to different job families.

Conclusion: The research provides a reliable and interpretable framework for internal talent discovery, reducing the risk of missing suitable candidates by optimizing the balance between task alignment and collaboration patterns.

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

*Zohair Shafi,Serdar Kadioglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forge introduces a novel pre-training method for optimization problems, improving efficiency by eliminating the need to solve numerous hard instances for training and enhancing scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies and scalability limitations in learning-based approaches by introducing a pre-training method that doesn't rely on solutions of optimization problems.

Method: Developed Forge, a vector-quantized graph autoencoder trained on diverse mixed-integer programming instances without relying on their solutions.

Result: Forge embeddings showed effective clustering in unsupervised settings and improved prediction performance for warm starts and integrality gaps in supervised settings, benefiting commercial optimization solvers.

Conclusion: Forge embeddings offer a scalable and generalizable approach to combinatorial optimization, with shared pre-trained model weights encouraging further research and real-world applications.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

### [205] [Dynamic Synthetic Controls vs. Panel-Aware Double Machine Learning for Geo-Level Marketing Impact Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20335)
*Sang Su Lee,Vineeth Loganathan,Vijay Raghavan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) for geo-level marketing lift analysis and proposes a more robust framework using panel-Double Machine Learning (DML) in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geo-level marketing experiments face challenges in accurately measuring effects due to bias in existing methods like SCM.

Method: The authors constructed an open simulator to test 7 estimators, including SCM variants and 4 panel-DML approaches, across 5 stress tests representing real-world complications.

Result: Panel-DML models outperformed SCM in robustness, demonstrating lower bias and higher coverage under complex conditions.

Conclusion: The paper advocates a diagnose-first approach to tailor DML models for specific geo-experiment challenges, offering a more effective framework.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

### [206] [Understanding Incremental Learning with Closed-form Solution to Gradient Flow on Overparamerterized Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20344)
*Hancheng Min,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies incremental learning behavior in neural networks, particularly focusing on matrix factorization with gradient flow. It develops a quantitative framework through a Riccati-like equation solution and examines implications for learning dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the implicit bias or regularization properties of first-order optimization algorithms during neural network training, focusing on the intriguing phenomenon of incremental learning.

Method: The study uses a closed-form solution derived from a Riccati-like matrix differential equation to analyze gradient flow dynamics in symmetric matrix factorization problems.

Result: The authors demonstrate that incremental learning arises due to time-scale separation among dynamics associated with different components of the target matrix. Reduced initialization scale enhances these separations, aiding low-rank approximations.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into incremental learning in gradient flow, emphasizing its dependence on initialization scale and dynamics separation. The authors propose extending such analysis to asymmetric matrix factorization for broader applicability.

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

*Zhibang Yang,Xinke Jiang,Rihong Qiu,Ruiqing Li,Yihang Zhang,Yue Fang,Yongxin Xu,Hongxin Ding,Xu Chu,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DFAMS, a novel Federated Retrieval system that uses dynamic information flow (DIF) to improve retrieval for ambiguous and cross-domain queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Federated Retrieval methods fail to retrieve high-quality documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios, which affects downstream tasks.

Method: DFAMS uses gradient signals and Shapley value-based attribution to identify latent intents and subdomain boundaries, followed by multi-prototype contrastive learning to enable semantic alignment across datasets.

Result: DFAMS achieves significant improvements in benchmarks, with up to 14.37% improvement in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in QA accuracy.

Conclusion: DFAMS effectively addresses limitations in Federated Retrieval for complex and distributed scenarios, making it more reliable for supporting large language model tasks.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal machine-learning (MMML) model that predicts hood frame performance metrics using multiple data types. This minimizes reliance on simulations, accelerates design iterations, and ensures high standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in evaluating hood frame geometries and reduce the time and computational expenses associated with simulation setup.

Method: A multimodal machine-learning (MMML) architecture was developed to learn from diverse data modalities for predicting performance metrics and enhancing design efficiency.

Result: The MMML approach outperformed traditional single-modality methods and demonstrated its generalizability by accurately predicting performance for two unseen frame geometries.

Conclusion: MMML has significant potential in augmenting engineering design workflows, especially during the concept design phase, by bridging machine learning with real-world applications and advancing structural optimization.

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents BiListing, a method using large-language and pretrained language-image models to create unified embeddings of text and images for Airbnb listings, enabling improved ML applications and significant business gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of combining diverse unstructured data (text and images) from Airbnb listings into a single coherent representation for better information extraction and ML utility.

Method: BiListing aligns text and images using large-language models and pretrained language-image models to create single embedding vectors per listing and modality. It incorporates zero-shot capability, resolves the cold-start problem, and supports multimodal and single-modality searches.

Result: The deployment of BiListing in Airbnb's search ranking model led to a 0.425% gain in NDCG and drove tens of millions in incremental revenue.

Conclusion: BiListing effectively captures diverse unstructured data for ML tasks, enabling efficient search, resolving cold-start issues, and delivering measurable business improvements.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

*Shijie Wang,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TF-TransUNet1D, a deep learning model for denoising ECG signals via time-frequency domain optimization, achieving superior reconstruction and diagnostic integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG signals are integral for cardiac digital twins but are often compromised by noise and artifacts, affecting their diagnostic utility. The paper aims to enhance denoising techniques to preserve signal quality.

Method: The TF-TransUNet1D integrates a U-Net-based encoder-decoder with a Transformer encoder and dual-domain loss function for optimizing ECG signal reconstruction in both time and frequency domains. It emphasizes spectral fidelity and morphological feature preservation.

Result: Experiments using MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and NSTDB datasets show the model outperformed state-of-the-art baselines with a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation of 0.9540, proving effective denoising performance.

Conclusion: TF-TransUNet1D addresses the critical need for robust ECG signal denoising, supporting enhanced real-time monitoring and personalized cardiac modeling for digital twin systems.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TLinFormer introduces a linear attention mechanism addressing the quadratic complexity bottleneck in Transformers, achieving competitive performance with reduced memory and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of the Transformer’s self-attention mechanism when processing long sequences due to its quadratic complexity.

Method: The method involves reconfiguring neural connection patterns to achieve linear complexity while maintaining exact attention scores and full historical context.

Result: TLinFormer showed significant improvement in metrics like inference latency, KV cache efficiency, memory usage, and overall speed when benchmarked against standard Transformers.

Conclusion: TLinFormer successfully bridges the performance-efficiency trade-off gap in long-sequence tasks, retaining information flow quality while improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

*Benjamin Couéraud,Vikram Sunkara,Christof Schütte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a geometric regularization for autoencoders to enhance decoding using nonlinear conformal regularization, enabling insights like local deformation measurements and manifold curvature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimensionality reduction is vital for understanding high-dimensional data and applications that seek to uncover main factors that explain the data. Autoencoders are a promising approach for learning low-dimensional representations.

Method: The method introduces nonlinear conformal regularization in autoencoders. This technique adds flexibility in the decoder’s local variations and incorporates a scalar field called the conformal factor to measure deformation.

Result: Through experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets, the paper demonstrates the utility of the method in calculating local deformations and the scalar curvature of the learned data manifolds.

Conclusion: Nonlinear conformal regularization provides a novel way to enrich the representational insights of autoencoders, while enabling curvature and deformation computations to better model high-dimensional data.

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

*Michael Widener,Kausik Lakkaraju,John Aydin,Biplav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates time-series forecasting models' performances and interpretability across diverse domains, revealing strengths of traditional feature-engineered approaches versus foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of time-series forecasting models, as their outputs increasingly inform real-world decisions.

Method: The study combines explainable AI (XAI) techniques with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to analyze four forecasting model types (ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos, Llama) across datasets from finance, energy, transportation, and automotive sales.

Result: Feature-engineered models like Gradient Boosting outperform foundation models (Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains, offering more interpretable insights, while foundation models perform better in stable, trend-driven contexts.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that selecting models should depend on domain-specific characteristics: traditional models for complex, sparse data and foundation models for stable data trends.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion Tree (DiTree) is introduced as a framework combining diffusion policies with sampling-based motion planners to provide fast and provably-safe kinodynamic motion planning, significantly outperforming existing approaches in speed and success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kinodynamic motion planning faces challenges from uninformed action sampling in sampling-based planners and poor generalization in learning-based approaches. The goal of this paper is to bridge these gaps for improved efficiency, safety, and adaptability.

Method: The method integrates diffusion policies as informed samplers within sampling-based planners to efficiently guide state-space searches, preserving safety and completeness guarantees while leveraging the capacity to learn from expert trajectory distributions.

Result: DiTree achieves runtimes comparable to standalone diffusion policies and is 3x faster than classical sampling-based planners. It outperforms baseline approaches by approximately 30% in success rate across out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: DiTree provides a robust, provably-generalizable framework for efficient kinodynamic motion planning, merging the benefits of sampling-based and learning-based approaches for improved practicality and performance in robotic applications.

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates diagonal state-space model (SSM) initialization from a frequency perspective and proposes a new initialization method, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role and improve the efficiency and performance of diagonal state-space model initialization schemes.

Method: They analyze diagonal SSM parameters through a frequency perspective and introduce a discrete Fourier domain diagonal initialization called S4D-DFouT.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like the Long Range Arena and enables training on large-scale datasets like PathX-256.

Conclusion: Diagonal SSM initialization can be better understood through frequency analysis, and the proposed method improves scalability and results.

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EAGLE-PC, a novel unlearning framework for large language models (LLMs) to effectively remove specific data while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With privacy and ownership concerns, there is a need to selectively remove private or copyrighted data from LLMs without full retraining.

Method: EAGLE-PC uses entanglement-awareness guided loss reweighting to prioritize unlearning based on sample similarity and applies a proxy constraint using ICL-generated data to prevent over-forgetting.

Result: EAGLE-PC demonstrates improved forgetting-utility balance on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, nearing the performance of fully retrained models when paired with the NPO+GD optimizer.

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC provides a scalable, robust, and efficient solution for machine unlearning, making it compatible with existing gradient-based methods and enhancing unlearning efficacy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome privacy and regulatory barriers that hinder real-world data usage in fields like healthcare and finance by improving methods for generating differentially private synthetic data.

Method: A unified benchmark is designed to systematically assess utility and fidelity across five domain-specific datasets, using realistic privacy budgets and tailored evaluation metrics.

Result: Significant degradation in dataset utility and fidelity is observed when strict Differential Privacy constraints are applied, showcasing limitations in current generation methods.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the inadequacies of current privacy-preserving methods and the importance of developing advanced techniques and realistic evaluation practices for synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

*Haiyan Wang,Ye Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework to enhance predictive modeling using Electronic Health Records (EHR), addressing limitations of existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based methods for predictive modeling in EHR fail to capture higher-order dependencies and are restricted by localized message-passing schemes.

Method: The paper proposes SHGT, which includes a hypergraph structural encoder for higher-order interactions, Transformer architecture for global reasoning on hypergraphs, and a custom loss function for hypergraph structure preservation.

Result: Experiments using real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that SHGT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in diagnosis prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SHGT framework effectively mitigates the limitations of traditional GNNs, offering a robust method for leveraging EHR data in predictive tasks.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

*Weihai Zhi,Jiayan Guo,Shangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedGR$^2$, a framework integrating self-generated data and reinforcement learning to enhance generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine struggle due to limited expert-annotated data and challenges with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning in data-scarce domains.

Method: MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and reward model to iteratively produce high-quality medical data, which supports both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).

Result: Experiments show that models trained with MedGR$^2$ surpass baselines using large-scale curated datasets and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across tasks and modalities, even with relatively fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The innovative MedGR$^2$ framework shifts focus from data scarcity to data generation, establishing a foundation for generalizable medical AI solutions through efficient reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

### [222] [MERIT: Maximum-normalized Element-wise Ratio for Language Model Large-batch Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20577)
*Yang Luo,Zangwei Zheng,Ziheng Qin,Zirui Zhu,Yong Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MERIT, a novel optimizer for improving large-batch training of deep neural networks by addressing limitations in existing optimizers like AdamW and LAMB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-batch training accelerates training of neural networks but suffers from optimization and generalization challenges, particularly due to information bottlenecks in attention layers and the inefficiency of existing optimizers.

Method: The authors design MERIT, which uses max-norm to calculate trust ratios that constrain the max attention logit, and employs element-wise trust ratios for robust update scaling.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MERIT achieves superior performance in large-batch training. For example, it allows GPT-2 Medium to train with a 6k batch size without performance degradation with 48B tokens.

Conclusion: MERIT significantly improves training stability, resolves attention logit bottlenecks, and enables faster development of large language models, paving the way for larger batch usage.

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

### [223] [Local Virtual Nodes for Alleviating Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20597)
*Tuğrul Hasan Karabulut,İnci M. Baytaş*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses over-squashing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by introducing Local Virtual Nodes (LVNs) with trainable embeddings, designed to mitigate bottlenecks while preserving the original graph's structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-squashing limits GNN performance on tasks with long-range dependencies by creating bottlenecks in the communication between distant nodes.

Method: The paper proposes LVNs placed based on node centrality to improve connectivity in bottleneck-prone regions. Trainable LVN embeddings are shared across key regions for better node communication without altering overall graph topology.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that LVNs enhance structural connectivity and improve performance in graph and node classification tasks.

Conclusion: LVNs offer an effective solution to over-squashing by providing additional communication pathways without compromising the global topology of input graphs.

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

TL;DR: This paper explores applying Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised learning on 1D ultrasound signal analysis, showing their effectiveness over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of limited labeled data and highly task-specific requirements in ultrasound signal analysis, especially in applications like non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM).

Method: The authors propose using MAEs to pre-train models on unlabeled synthetic 1D ultrasound signals, assessing the impact of model size, patch size, and masking ratio during pre-training and comparing downstream task performance.

Result: Pre-trained models significantly outperform models trained from scratch and traditional CNN baselines. The use of synthetic data for pre-training shows better transferability to real datasets than models trained solely on limited real data.

Conclusion: MAEs show strong potential for scalable, self-supervised learning in ultrasound signal analysis, highlighting their capability to advance performance and overcome challenges in this domain.

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Method: The GDS agent incorporates graph algorithms as tools within a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling preprocessing and postprocessing for graph-related queries. This system works with modern LLMs.

Result: The GDS agent demonstrates the ability to solve a wide range of graph tasks and delivers accurate and well-grounded answers. A new benchmark was also introduced to evaluate its performance.

Conclusion: The GDS agent enhances LLM abilities in graph-structured data reasoning. While effective in many scenarios, challenges remain, with a roadmap proposed for future improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VarDiU, a novel method for one-step diffusion distillation, addresses biases in training gradients for improved sample generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome biased gradient estimates caused by imperfect DSM training in existing diffusion distillation methods.

Method: The proposed VarDiU framework introduces an unbiased gradient estimator using a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound.

Result: VarDiU achieves higher generation quality compared to Diff-Instruct and ensures more efficient and stable training.

Conclusion: VarDiU improves the training process and output sample quality in one-step diffusion distillation through unbiased gradient estimation.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel self-composition framework for neural operators to enhance efficiency and accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results in scientific machine learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in solving numerical PDEs efficiently and accurately using neural operators by taking inspiration from iterative methods.

Method: The paper employs a self-composition approach by deepening the neural operator model progressively without adding extra blocks and introduces an adaptive train-and-unroll technique to optimize training.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and shows effectiveness in handling the complex high-frequency USCT problem with computational savings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable, accurate, and computationally efficient solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine learning applications.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine

*Michael Hagmann,Michael Staniek,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores compositionality in clinical time series, creating synthetic data to address sparse clinical data issues, validated through domain adaptation tests and SOFA score evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of sparse and low-resource data in clinical time series, and enhance our understanding of the underlying compositional structure in these series.

Method: The authors propose a data-driven procedure that identifies elementary states and composition rules of clinical time series data. They validate this method via domain adaptation tests comparing risk and performance between models trained with original versus synthetic data.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate similar performance on synthetic and original data, outperforming randomization-based augmentation. SOFA score prediction tasks show significant gains using compositionally synthesized data.

Conclusion: The proposed compositional approach can effectively generate synthetic clinical time series data, enhancing model training and performance in sparse data settings.

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

*Weitao Feng,Lixu Wang,Tianyi Wei,Jie Zhang,Chongyang Gao,Sinong Zhan,Peizhuo Lv,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals that RL-based fine-tuning is more effective than SFT in misusing LLMs for harmful purposes, and introduces TokenBuncher, a defense mechanism designed to combat such RL-based threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the emerging threat of reinforcement learning (RL) being used by adversaries to break safety alignment in large language models, which poses a greater risk than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Method: The authors developed 'TokenBuncher,' a defense mechanism leveraging entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism to constrain model response uncertainty and prevent RL-based harmful fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that TokenBuncher effectively mitigates harmful RL-based fine-tuning across various models and RL algorithms, while preserving the utility for benign tasks.

Conclusion: The study cautions that RL-based fine-tuning represents a significant systemic risk to LLMs, but the proposed TokenBuncher defense is a practical and general solution to mitigate this risk without impairing legitimate functionalities.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EEGDM, a self-supervised EEG representation learning approach using latent diffusion models, which achieves robust results across various tasks with limited pre-training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG representation learning models face difficulties in learning generalizable representations, especially when training data is scarce. Current methods relying on masked reconstruction objectives fail to fully extract semantic information from EEG signals.

Method: The researchers propose EEGDM, a method based on latent diffusion models. It includes an EEG encoder that distills signal and channel information into a compact latent space, which is then used as conditional data for generative processes. The model leverages EEG signal generation as a self-supervised objective.

Result: EEGDM effectively reconstructs high-quality EEG signals, learns robust and generalizable representations, and demonstrates competitive performance across various downstream tasks even with limited pre-training data.

Conclusion: EEGDM offers a promising self-supervised learning solution for EEG analysis by leveraging diffusion models, addressing limitations in semantic extraction and generalizability found in existing methods.

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

*Christoforos N. Spartalis,Theodoros Semertzidis,Petros Daras,Efstratios Gavves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFEMax is an innovative approach for Machine Unlearning in diffusion models, promoting privacy by halting denoising on restricted data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selectively removing specific learned data from diffusion models while retaining efficiency and performance.

Method: SAFEMax uses entropy maximization to disrupt model output for impermissible classes, focusing on early steps in the diffusion process where class-specific traits emerge.

Result: The method successfully causes the model to produce Gaussian noise for restricted classes and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: SAFEMax offers an effective and efficient solution for Machine Unlearning in diffusion models, balancing forgetting and data retention.

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion
models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the
entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when
conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising
process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention
by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific
information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax
and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

### [233] [cMALC-D: Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20818)
*Anirudh Satheesh,Keenan Powell,Hua Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes cMALC-D, a curriculum learning framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and diversity-based context blending to improve contextual multi-agent reinforcement learning (cMARL) by addressing generalization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL methods lack robustness when applied to complex real-world scenarios due to their reliance on fixed simulation environments and noisy curriculum learning signals.

Method: The authors introduce cMALC-D, which utilizes LLMs to create meaningful training curricula and incorporates diversity-based context blending to craft new training scenarios and promote exploration.

Result: Experiments on traffic signal control tasks show that cMALC-D enhances both generalization and sample efficiency over traditional curriculum learning approaches.

Conclusion: cMALC-D offers a novel, effective approach to designing robust MARL algorithms by combining LLM-guided curricula with diversity-driven training context generation.

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

*Yang Gao,Dongjie Wang,Scott Piersall,Ye Zhang,Liqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using a revised GPT model to optimize automated feature transformations efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing computational costs and parameter requirements in automated feature transformation methods for scalable machine learning implementations.

Method: Four-step approach: transformation record collection, embedding space creation with a revised GPT, gradient-ascent search, and autoregressive reconstruction.

Result: The proposed framework achieves similar or improved performance compared to baselines, with significant computational efficiency on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures can effectively and scalably enhance automated feature transformation processes in machine learning.

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

### [235] [ATM-GAD: Adaptive Temporal Motif Graph Anomaly Detection for Financial Transaction Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20829)
*Zeyue Zhang,Lin Song,Erkang Bao,Xiaoling Lv,Xinyue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATM-GAD is a graph neural network method designed to improve financial fraud detection by leveraging temporal motifs and account-specific time intervals, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting financial fraud in modern systems, where conventional machine learning models and some graph-based detectors fail. This failure is due to the dynamic nature of financial systems and the lack of leveraging temporal and account-specific behavioral signals.

Method: The proposed method, ATM-GAD, incorporates temporal motifs and adaptive time-window learning. It uses a Temporal Motif Extractor to summarize transaction histories into motifs and employs dual-attention blocks (IntraA for within-motif analysis and InterA for cross-motif reasoning). Additionally, it introduces an Adaptive Time-Window Learner for dynamic focus on periods with anomalous activities.

Result: ATM-GAD was tested on four real-world datasets, consistently outperforming seven strong anomaly detection baselines and uncovering fraud patterns previously missed by traditional methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that incorporating temporal motifs and adaptive time windows into graph neural networks significantly improves financial fraud detection by capturing both multi-step and short-burst fraud schemes.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

*Yijia Guo,Junqing Zhang,Y. -W. Peter Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning-based physical layer authentication method for IoT devices, using channel state information (CSI), demonstrating improved results over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Device authentication in IoT is vulnerable due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions. Current physical layer authentication methods lack effective solutions for dynamic channel variations.

Method: A CNN-based Siamese network model was trained using a synthetic dataset derived from channel correlations, reducing data collection overhead. The model learned temporal and spatial correlations between CSI pairs and was evaluated via simulations and experiments in various scenarios.

Result: The proposed method showed excellent generalization and authentication performance, with a 0.03 increase in AUC compared to FCN-based models and a 0.06 increase over correlation-based baseline algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning-based authentication scheme effectively addresses challenges in dynamic channel variations, providing superior IoT device authentication performance.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset of over 120 million atomic configurations standardized from various repositories, aimed at improving the training of ML interatomic potentials (MLIPs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of MLIPs is hindered by the inconsistency, fragmentation, and difficulty of combining different quantum mechanical datasets, which are costly to generate.

Method: The authors standardized, harmonized, and filtered data from large repositories like the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD, creating LeMat-Traj. They also developed LeMaterial-Fetcher, a library to streamline reproducible integration of new data sources.

Result: Models pre-trained with LeMat-Traj demonstrated significantly reduced force prediction errors during relaxation tasks, proving its effectiveness in improving MLIP accuracy and transferability.

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj, paired with the LeMaterial-Fetcher tool, greatly advances the accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of creating MLIPs by addressing limitations in existing datasets. Both resources are made publicly available for community use.

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

*Dmitry Eremeev,Gleb Bazhenov,Oleg Platonov,Artem Babenko,Liudmila Prokhorenkova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces G2T-FM, a graph foundation model using TabPFNv2 for enhanced node representation and neighborhood aggregation in graph machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have transformed fields like NLP and CV, but their application to graph machine learning is underexplored. Handling diverse node features in graphs remains a key challenge.

Method: The method involves augmenting node features with neighborhood aggregation, structural embeddings, and applying TabPFNv2 to the resulting features to derive representations.

Result: G2T-FM outperforms existing GFMs, matches baseline GNNs, and exceeds their performance after fine-tuning, showcasing its strong capabilities.

Conclusion: G2T-FM demonstrates the potential for leveraging tabular foundation models in graph machine learning tasks, opening new avenues in this research area.

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

*Katherine B. Adams,Justin J. Boutilier,Qinyang He,Yonatan Mintz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework within the multi-armed bandit literature to tackle sequential resource allocation challenges with nonstationary reward distributions, focusing on dynamic interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dynamic challenges in resource allocation for settings like community health, digital advertising, and workforce retention, where intervention effects and agent responses evolve over time.

Method: The authors propose algorithms that balance heterogeneous individual rewards with the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in nonstationary environments, and provide theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret.

Result: The proposed algorithms demonstrated up to three times improvement in program enrollment compared to baseline methods in a diabetes intervention case study.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges adaptive learning methods with practical applications for population behavioral change, proving impactful for real-world interventions.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents InSQuAD, a method for improving in-context learning (ICL) by enforcing quality and diversity among selected examples using Submodular Mutual Information (SMI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current ICL retrieval methods that overlook diversity in in-context exemplar selection, crucial for improving learning models.

Method: InSQuAD employs SMI to select diverse and high-quality examples for ICL. It also introduces a novel combinatorial training approach that optimizes an SMI function via a likelihood-based loss, improving both relevance and diversity.

Result: When evaluated on nine benchmark datasets, the proposed InSQuAD framework demonstrated significant improvements in ICL performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: InSQuAD effectively enhances ICL by incorporating diverse and high-quality in-context examples, showcasing a promising approach for generalization and robustness in ICL-based tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

*Luozhijie Jin,Zijie Qiu,Jie Liu,Zijie Diao,Lifeng Qiao,Ning Ding,Alex Lamb,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an inference-time method for improving and controlling alignment quality in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning generative models with complex downstream objectives, especially in scenarios where traditional RL fine-tuning proves suboptimal.

Method: RLG integrates outputs of base and RL fine-tuned models using a geometric average, with an adjustable guidance scale that allows dynamic alignment control.

Result: RLG enhances performance in multiple downstream tasks, including human preferences and compositional control, and provides flexibility for interpolation and extrapolation.

Conclusion: RLG is a practical, flexible, and theoretically grounded solution for improving and controlling generative model alignment during inference.

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency and impracticality of retraining pre-trained machine learning models from scratch when specific training samples need to be unlearned.

Method: LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of models based on information-theoretic principles, reducing memorization-induced overconfidence. It introduces the Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric for performance evaluation under real-world scenarios.

Result: LoTUS demonstrated superior performance in efficiency and effectiveness compared to eight baselines on public datasets, including ImageNet1k.

Conclusion: LoTUS effectively alleviates the retraining requirement in Machine Unlearning, making it scalable and practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from
scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an
information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that
LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of human forebrain organoids as adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements for scalable computing architectures.

Method: The study maps tactile sensor data to electrical stimulation patterns for human forebrain organoids, measures their response in spike activity and spatial shifts, and classifies Braille letters using both single and multi-organoid setups.

Result: Achieved 61% classification accuracy with a single organoid and 83% accuracy with a three-organoid ensemble, showing improved robustness against noise in multi-organoid configurations.

Conclusion: Organoids have significant potential as low-power, adaptive computational units, and the proposed encoding framework serves as a basis for developing scalable bio-hybrid architectures.

Abstract: This study proposes a generalizable encoding strategy that maps tactile
sensor data to electrical stimulation patterns, enabling neural organoids to
perform an open-loop artificial tactile Braille classification task. Human
forebrain organoids cultured on a low-density microelectrode array (MEA) are
systematically stimulated to characterize the relationship between electrical
stimulation parameters (number of pulse, phase amplitude, phase duration, and
trigger delay) and organoid responses, measured as spike activity and spatial
displacement of the center of activity. Implemented on event-based tactile
inputs recorded from the Evetac sensor, our system achieved an average Braille
letter classification accuracy of 61 percent with a single organoid, which
increased significantly to 83 percent when responses from a three-organoid
ensemble were combined. Additionally, the multi-organoid configuration
demonstrated enhanced robustness against various types of artificially
introduced noise. This research demonstrates the potential of organoids as
low-power, adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements and provides a
foundational encoding framework for future scalable bio-hybrid computing
architectures.

*Ruiyang Xu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces POS2FS, addressing limitations in online streaming feature selection by leveraging PSO and three-way decision theory to better handle data incompleteness and uncertain feature-label correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance feature selection models that struggle with data incompleteness and uncertain feature-label relationships in streaming data applications.

Method: The proposed method, POS2FS, integrates particle swarm optimization (PSO) for supervision and three-way decision theory to effectively manage uncertainty and feature fuzziness.

Result: POS2FS demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, achieving higher accuracy on six real-world datasets.

Conclusion: POS2FS offers a more flexible and accurate approach to online sparse streaming feature selection, tackling uncertainty and data incompleteness challenges effectively.

Abstract: In real-world applications involving high-dimensional streaming data, online
streaming feature selection (OSFS) is widely adopted. Yet, practical
deployments frequently face data incompleteness due to sensor failures or
technical constraints. While online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS)
mitigates this issue via latent factor analysis-based imputation, existing
methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to
inflexible models and degraded performance. To address these gaps, this work
proposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection
framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach
introduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label

*Yi Jiang,Malyaban Bal,Brian Matejek,Susmit Jha,Adam Cobb,Abhronil Sengupta*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper explores a spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in energy-constrained environments by leveraging the energy-efficient properties of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).

Method: The paper combines spatial pruning (reducing active neurons and attention heads) and temporal pruning (adjusting timesteps dynamically) with extreme quantization and knowledge distillation for SpikingBERT.

Result: Experimental evaluations on the GLUE benchmark show the framework's success in reducing computational operations and inference latency while retaining performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates that Spiking LLMs can achieve low-power, real-time natural language processing, making them suitable for edge devices and power-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in
energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high
inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse
event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in
the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing.
Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced
capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs.
This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here,
we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and
propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize
computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning
technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively
lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning
minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps
required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other
compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs
to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and
knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our
proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark
demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations
and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time,
low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more
practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.

### [247] [Solvable Tuple Patterns and Their Applications to Program Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20365)
*Naoki Kobayashi,Ryosuke Sato,Ayumi Shinohara,Ryo Yoshinaka*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Solvable Tuple Patterns (STPs) for automated verification of programs handling recursive data structures, which are inferred efficiently from positive samples and integrate into CHC solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated verification of programs manipulating recursive data structures remains difficult despite advancements in the field.

Method: The paper introduces STPs, describes their properties, presents an inference algorithm, and integrates STP inference into Constrained Horn Clause (CHC) solvers with SMT support for sequence theory.

Result: Integration of STPs into CHC solvers achieved success, winning the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 by a significant margin.

Conclusion: The proposed STP framework is efficient and effective for automated program verification involving recursive data structures, demonstrating significant advancements in the field.

Abstract: Despite the recent progress of automated program verification techniques,
fully automated verification of programs manipulating recursive data structures
remains a challenge. We introduce the notion of solvable tuple patterns (STPs)
to express invariants between list-like recursive data structures. A
distinguishing feature of STPs is that they can be efficiently inferred from
only a small number of positive samples; no negative samples are required. An
SMT solver that supports the sequence theory can be used to check that an
inferred STP is indeed an inductive invariant. After presenting basic
properties of STPs and an STP inference algorithm, we show how to incorporate
the STP inference into a CHC (Constrained Horn Clauses) solver supporting
list-like data structures, which serves as a uniform backend for automated
program verification tools. A CHC solver incorporating the STP inference has
won the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 by a big margin.

### [248] [Static Factorisation of Probabilistic Programs With User-Labelled Sample Statements and While Loops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20922)
*Markus Böck,Jürgen Cito*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper addresses how probabilistic programs with user-labeled sampling and loops can be graphically represented, proposing techniques to improve efficiency in inference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the graphical representation of probabilistic programs with advanced features like labeled sampling and loops, which are common in several probabilistic programming languages.

Method: Extended operational semantics are used for programs, alongside static analysis and program slicing, to approximate dependencies and enable inference optimizations.

Result: Obtained a novel graphical representation for complex probabilistic programs and empirically demonstrated optimization techniques for variance reduction and inference speed-up.

Conclusion: This work enhances understanding of probabilistic program structure and provides practical optimizations for inference methods, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: It is commonly known that any Bayesian network can be implemented as a
probabilistic program, but the reverse direction is not so clear. In this work,
we address the open question to what extent a probabilistic program with
user-labelled sample statements and while loops - features found in languages
like Gen, Turing, and Pyro - can be represented graphically. To this end, we
extend existing operational semantics to support these language features. By
translating a program to its control-flow graph, we define a sound static
analysis that approximates the dependency structure of the random variables in
the program. As a result, we obtain a static factorisation of the implicitly
defined program density, which is equivalent to the known Bayesian network
factorisation for programs without loops and constant labels, but constitutes a
novel graphical representation for programs that define an unbounded number of
random variables via loops or dynamic labels. We further develop a sound
program slicing technique to leverage this structure to statically enable three
well-known optimisations for the considered program class: we reduce the
variance of gradient estimates in variational inference and we speed up both
single-site Metropolis Hastings and sequential Monte Carlo. These optimisations
are proven correct and empirically shown to match or outperform existing
techniques.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a tool-aware collision avoidance system that enhances robot safety and efficiency in dynamic environments by adapting to tool size and interaction modes while maintaining low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in ensuring safe and efficient robot operation in dynamic environments, where existing methods may lead to collisions or overly conservative behavior due to assumptions of full visibility and fixed tools.

Method: The approach combines a learned perception model to filter out robot and tool components, reason about occluded areas, and predict collisions under partial observability, with a constrained reinforcement learning control policy for efficient collision avoidance.

Result: Tests show the system outperforms traditional approaches like APF and MPPI in dynamic settings with sub-millimeter accuracy, achieves 60% lower computational cost compared to GPU-based planners, and ensures smooth, real-time maneuvers.

Conclusion: The proposed system is modular, efficient, and practical for collision avoidance in dynamic human-robot environments, offering improved safety, responsiveness, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in human
environments is challenging, especially in dynamic settings where both obstacle
motion and tasks change over time. Current robot controllers typically assume
full visibility and fixed tools, which can lead to collisions or overly
conservative behavior. In our work, we introduce a tool-aware collision
avoidance system that adjusts in real time to different tool sizes and modes of
tool-environment interaction. Using a learned perception model, our system
filters out robot and tool components from the point cloud, reasons about
occluded area, and predicts collision under partial observability. We then use
a control policy trained via constrained reinforcement learning to produce
smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 milliseconds. In simulated and
real-world tests, our approach outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPPI)
in dynamic environments, while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. Moreover,
our system operates with approximately 60% lower computational cost compared to
a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner. Our approach provides modular, efficient,
and effective collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic environments.
We integrate our method into a collaborative robot application and demonstrate
its practical use for safe and responsive operation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents SPGrasp, a real-time framework for dynamic grasp synthesis using spatiotemporal prompts with low latency and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic object grasp synthesis struggle with latency and maintaining interactivity, creating a need for a real-time and promptable solution.

Method: The authors developed SPGrasp, an extension of the SAMv2 framework, to integrate spatiotemporal context and user prompts, achieving low latency and temporal consistency for real-time video stream grasp estimation.

Result: SPGrasp achieved high grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID, 93.8% on Jacquard, and 92.0% on GraspNet-1Billion, with significant latency reductions compared to previous methods. Real-world tests showed a 94.8% success rate across 13 dynamic objects.

Conclusion: SPGrasp successfully addresses the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis, enabling efficient and accurate real-time grasping for dynamic objects.

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in
interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively
resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimShear introduces a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that uses shear information without explicitly simulating shear dynamics, achieving realistic tactile image generation and successful application in robotic control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of effectively utilizing shear information, essential for dynamic object interactions but difficult to simulate realistically in robotics.

Method: Proposed the shPix2pix model, a shear-conditioned U-Net GAN, to translate simulated tactile images into realistic versions with shear deformation, and applied the pipeline to control robotics tasks.

Result: SimShear outperformed baseline methods in tactile image simulation and prediction, successfully achieving contact errors within 1–2 mm in control tasks involving shear sensing.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of sim-to-real shear modeling, paving the way for improved simulations in tactile robotics using rigid-body simulators.

Abstract: We present SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that enables
the use of shear information without explicitly modeling shear dynamics in
simulation. Shear, arising from lateral movements across contact surfaces, is
critical for tasks involving dynamic object interactions but remains
challenging to simulate. To address this, we introduce shPix2pix, a
shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that transforms simulated tactile images absent of
shear, together with a vector encoding shear information, into realistic
equivalents with shear deformations. This method outperforms baseline pix2pix
approaches in simulating tactile images and in pose/shear prediction. We apply
SimShear to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms
equipped with a vision-based tactile sensor: (i) a tactile tracking task, where
a follower arm tracks a surface moved by a leader arm, and (ii) a collaborative
co-lifting task, where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader
follows a prescribed trajectory. Our method maintains contact errors within 1
to 2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is essential, validating
the feasibility of sim-to-real shear modeling with rigid-body simulators and
opening new directions for simulation in tactile robotics.

### [252] [Traversing the Narrow Path: A Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning Framework for Humanoid Beam Walking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20661)
*TianChen Huang,Wei Gao,Runchen Xu,Shiwu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage framework for humanoid robots to traverse narrow beams more reliably by combining a footstep template with residual planning and minimal sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traversing narrow beams is difficult for humanoid robots due to the sparsity of stable contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies.

Method: The framework employs a two-stage process: stage-1 trains the robot to track footsteps with robustness on flat ground, while stage-2 uses simulation to train a planner for precise foot placements on beams, using minimal sensing.

Result: The system successfully enabled the Unitree G1 robot to traverse a narrow beam (0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long), outperforming template-only and monolithic baselines in various metrics like success rate and safety.

Conclusion: The structured footstep interface and residual refinement improve beam traversal performance while facilitating clean sim-to-real transfer and transparent analysis.

Abstract: Traversing narrow beams is challenging for humanoids due to sparse,
safety-critical contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies. We
propose a physically grounded, two-stage framework that couples an XCoM/LIPM
footstep template with a lightweight residual planner and a simple low-level
tracker. Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly
follow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic
footsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable
contact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in
simulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual
(Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template
step to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while
preserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and
consistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact,
forward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a
Unitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. Across
simulation and real-world studies, residual refinement consistently outperforms
template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence,
and safety margins, while the structured footstep interface enables transparent
analysis and low-friction sim-to-real transfer.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework leveraging digital twins and meta-learning to address real-time interaction challenges in the industrial Metaverse, achieving improved visual fidelity and control precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like computational loads, bandwidth constraints, and low-latency requirements in human-device interaction within industrial Metaverse environments.

Method: Introduces a task-oriented edge-assisted framework using digital twins, integrating predictive operator motion models and the HITL-MAML algorithm to dynamically adapt horizons for better performance.

Result: Achieved notable improvements: reduced weighted RMSE in drawing task and high image quality in a 3D nuclear decommissioning scene with significant metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances spatial precision and visual quality, supporting real-time interactions in critical industrial settings like the Metaverse.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's
capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time,
high-risk industrial environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of transferring skilled expertise from humans to robots. It proposes a technique using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for flexible motion translation, allowing robots to learn tasks flexibly and adapt to human input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The declining number of skilled workers globally necessitates efficient ways of transferring expertise to robots. Current methods lack the flexibility to adapt tasks based on human intentions or input.

Method: The authors propose a flexible motion translation framework using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), enabling robots to learn tasks based on input data and a trained model.

Result: The proposed system was evaluated using a 3-DOF calligraphy robot, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness in task learning and execution.

Conclusion: The research presents a novel approach to imitation learning that overcomes limitations of conventional methods, offering adaptable and intuitive robot task training.

Abstract: Decreasing skilled workers is a very serious problem in the world. To deal
with this problem, the skill transfer from experts to robots has been
researched. These methods which teach robots by human motion are called
imitation learning. Experts' skills generally appear in not only position data,
but also force data. Thus, position and force data need to be saved and
reproduced. To realize this, a lot of research has been conducted in the
framework of a motion-copying system. Recent research uses machine learning
methods to generate motion commands. However, most of them could not change
tasks by following human intention. Some of them can change tasks by
conditional training, but the labels are limited. Thus, we propose the flexible
motion translation method by using Generative Adversarial Networks. The
proposed method enables users to teach robots tasks by inputting data, and
skills by a trained model. We evaluated the proposed system with a 3-DOF
calligraphy robot.

*Lorenzo Busellato,Federico Cunico,Diego Dall'Alba,Marco Emporio,Andrea Giachetti,Riccardo Muradore,Marco Cristani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a framework for using probabilistic human hand motion forecasting to improve safety and responsiveness in collaborative robotic cells.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative robotic environments need to balance safety and responsive human-robot interaction, but current methods often overestimate dangers due to worst-case predictions, hampering fluidity and progress.

Method: The framework combines probabilistic human motion forecasts with Control Barrier Functions to dynamically adjust safety margins based on uncertainty estimations.

Result: UA-PCBFs demonstrated superior performance in task-critical metrics, reducing violations of safe space in human-robot interactions when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: UA-PCBFs enhance collaborative robotics by enabling intelligent and fluid interactions, fostering both safety and efficiency.

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and
robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent
safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A
dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:
when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake
unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true
Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion
prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case
scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a
well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,
limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control
Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic
human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control
Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for
dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty
estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,
UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future
human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through
informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world
experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to
perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot
interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).
Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better
performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of
violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the
state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The integrated thermal-haptic interface proves effective in enhancing human interaction in virtual and teleoperation tasks, offering precise and dynamic feedback with promising application potential.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fabric-based thermal-haptic interface for virtual

fabric with an innovative ultra-lightweight design, achieving only 2~g for each
finger unit. By embedding heating elements within textile pneumatic chambers,
the system delivers modulated pressure and thermal stimuli to fingerpads
through a fully soft, wearable interface.
  Comprehensive characterization demonstrates rapid thermal modulation with
heating rates up to 3$^{\circ}$C/s, enabling dynamic thermal feedback for
virtual or teleoperation interactions. The pneumatic subsystem generates forces
up to 8.93~N at 50~kPa, while optimization of fingerpad-actuator clearance
enhances cooling efficiency with minimal force reduction. Experimental
validation conducted with two different user studies shows high temperature
identification accuracy (0.98 overall) across three thermal levels, and
significant manipulation improvements in a virtual pick-and-place tasks.
Results show enhanced success rates (88.5\% to 96.4\%, p = 0.029) and improved

Method: The research utilizes an experimental setup to test the ESC approach's ability to achieve controlled hovering and source seeking in flapping robots, focusing on a 1D case study.

Result: The experiments successfully confirm the effectiveness of ESC in achieving model-free, real-time hovering and source seeking in flapping robotic systems.

Conclusion: ESC demonstrates significant potential as a natural and effective control method for flapping robotics, thereby advancing biomimicry in robotic systems.

Abstract: In a recent effort, we successfully proposed a categorically novel approach
to mimic the phenomenoa of hovering and source seeking by flapping insects and
hummingbirds using a new extremum seeking control (ESC) approach. Said ESC
approach was shown capable of characterizing the physics of hovering and source
seeking by flapping systems, providing at the same time uniquely novel
opportunity for a model-free, real-time biomimicry control design. In this
paper, we experimentally test and verify, for the first time in the literature,
the potential of ESC in flapping robots to achieve model-free, real-time
controlled hovering and source seeking. The results of this paper, while being
restricted to 1D, confirm the premise of introducing ESC as a natural control
method and biomimicry mechanism to the field of flapping flight and robotics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM), a novel paradigm focusing on short-horizon video generation to overcome data challenges in video-based embodied world models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity and complexity of embodied data limit language-action alignment and hinder long-horizon generative video models from reaching their full potential.

Method: The proposed PEWM paradigm uses fixed short-horizon video generation, a modular Vision-Language Model planner, and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism for improved data efficiency and compositional generalization.

Result: PEWM improves fine-grained language and action alignment, reduces learning complexity, enhances data efficiency, and lowers inference latency. It supports modular planning and closed-loop compositional generalization for complex tasks.

Conclusion: PEWM bridges fine-grained physical interaction with high-level reasoning, paving the way for scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing
attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a
key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality
of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language
and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video
generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the
embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data
far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on
this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive
Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short
horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic
concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning
complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)
decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model
(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further
enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization
of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework
leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic
awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction
and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and
general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Motivation: To enhance efficiency and quality in optimal path planning by addressing current limitations in utilizing environmental data and information relationships within heuristic functions.

Method: The study proposed GIT*, incorporating repulsive forces, dynamic vertex importance, and Reinforced Genetic Programming (RGP) to mutate heuristic functions using environmental data.

Result: GIT* displayed better computational efficiency and solution quality than existing methods, demonstrated on R^4 to R^16 problems and real-world mobile manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating environmental data and RGP into heuristic functions improves path planning performance, showcasing the potential of GIT* in complex and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Optimal path planning involves finding a feasible state sequence between a
start and a goal that optimizes an objective. This process relies on heuristic
functions to guide the search direction. While a robust function can improve
search efficiency and solution quality, current methods often overlook
available environmental data and simplify the function structure due to the
complexity of information relationships. This study introduces Genetic Informed
Trees (GIT*), which improves upon Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) by integrating a
wider array of environmental data, such as repulsive forces from obstacles and
the dynamic importance of vertices, to refine heuristic functions for better
guidance. Furthermore, we integrated reinforced genetic programming (RGP),
which combines genetic programming with reward system feedback to mutate
genotype-generative heuristic functions for GIT*. RGP leverages a multitude of
data types, thereby improving computational efficiency and solution quality
within a set timeframe. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GIT* surpasses
existing single-query, sampling-based planners in problems ranging from R^4 to
R^16 and was tested on a real-world mobile manipulation task. A video

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a sampling-based motion planner that uses deep fuzzy learning to adapt to obstacle distributions, achieving faster and better solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of motion planning in robotics by addressing environmental adaptability in existing sampling-based methods.

Method: LIT* employs a deep fuzzy learning-based framework that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor selection based on obstacle distribution, encoding states to differentiate between dense and sparse regions.

Result: LIT* demonstrates faster convergence, lower computation time, and higher-quality solutions in environments with dimensions ranging from R^8 to R^14, and successfully performs in dual-arm robot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: LIT* outperforms current single-query sampling-based planners, delivering superior results in computational efficiency and solution quality across complex robotic scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient motion planning algorithms are essential in robotics. Optimizing
essential parameters, such as batch size and nearest neighbor selection in
sampling-based methods, can enhance performance in the planning process.
However, existing approaches often lack environmental adaptability. Inspired by
the method of the deep fuzzy neural networks, this work introduces
Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a sampling-based deep fuzzy
learning-based planner that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor
parameters to obstacle distributions in the configuration spaces. By encoding
both global and local ratios via valid and invalid states, LIT* differentiates
between obstacle-sparse and obstacle-dense regions, leading to lower-cost paths
and reduced computation time. Experimental results in high-dimensional spaces
demonstrate that LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution
quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-query, sampling-based planners
in environments ranging from R^8 to R^14 and is successfully validated on a
dual-arm robot manipulation task. A video showcasing our experimental results

*Jiaxi Huang,Yan Huang,Yixian Zhao,Wenchao Meng,Jinming Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes CoCoL, a decentralized collaborative learning method that enhances communication efficiency and robustness in multi-robot systems, particularly under data heterogeneity and dynamic network conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like high communication overhead and data heterogeneity in multi-robot collaborative learning tasks.

Method: The CoCoL method uses a mirror descent framework with approximate Newton-type updates to improve communication efficiency, inexact sub-problem solutions for reduced computational costs, and gradient tracking to handle data heterogeneity.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that CoCoL significantly reduces communication rounds and bandwidth consumption while retaining state-of-the-art accuracy, even in scenarios with non-IID data, streaming data, and time-varying network topologies.

Conclusion: CoCoL is an effective and efficient collaborative learning approach for multi-robot systems, excelling in scenarios with data heterogeneity, dynamic conditions, and communication constraints.

Abstract: Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of
multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to
high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot
tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized
Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL
achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type
updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and
reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore,
the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against
data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot
collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in
significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total
bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These
benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming
data, and time-varying network topologies.

*Liding Zhang,Zeqi Li,Kuanqi Cai,Qian Huang,Zhenshan Bing,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called Goal-Oriented Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS) for robots to efficiently find objects in unfamiliar settings. It combines language models, semantic perception, and a hierarchical decision process for enhanced navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for robot object search lack dynamic interpretability and struggle in unfamiliar, unstructured environments. This research addresses the need for smarter object search mechanisms.

Method: The authors developed GODHS, which integrates scene semantics, hierarchical navigation, large language models, and a heuristic-based motion planner for efficient search operations.

Result: Experiments in Isaac Sim showed that GODHS outperformed conventional search strategies in locating target objects efficiently.

Conclusion: GODHS offers a robust framework for efficient object search in robots by leveraging structured language models and hierarchical reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Enabling robots to efficiently search for and identify objects in complex,
unstructured environments is critical for diverse applications ranging from
household assistance to industrial automation. However, traditional scene
representations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable
contextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in
completely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a
language-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates
semantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented
Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large
language models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process
through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved
through the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each
stage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we
introduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting
with distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths.
Comprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search
efficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies. Website

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring underground environments that could provide shelter and resources for space missions, while overcoming the limitations of Earth's ground analogs.

Method: Designing and implementing PLUME, an adaptable procedural framework to create diverse and realistic underground 3D environments.

Result: PLUME successfully generated environments for AI and robotics simulations and was integrated into a robotic simulator.

Conclusion: PLUME offers a valuable tool for rapid development and testing in space exploration missions and is made openly available for wider use.

Abstract: As space exploration advances, underground environments are becoming
increasingly attractive due to their potential to provide shelter, easier
access to resources, and enhanced scientific opportunities. Although such
environments exist on Earth, they are often not easily accessible and do not
accurately represent the diversity of underground environments found throughout
the solar system. This paper presents PLUME, a procedural generation framework
aimed at easily creating 3D underground environments. Its flexible structure
allows for the continuous enhancement of various underground features, aligning
with our expanding understanding of the solar system. The environments
generated using PLUME can be used for AI training, evaluating robotics
algorithms, 3D rendering, and facilitating rapid iteration on developed
exploration algorithms. In this paper, it is demonstrated that PLUME has been

*Curtis C. Johnson,Daniel Webb,David Hill,Marc D. Killpack*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable tactile sensing system enabling robots to perform robust whole-body manipulation with real-time feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable, efficient tactile sensors for robust whole-body robotic manipulation is hindered by challenges like wiring, data throughput, and reliability.

Method: An innovative approach combining open-source fabric-based sensors, custom-readout electronics to reduce signal crosstalk, and a daisy-chained SPI bus for better efficiency. The system handles data from 8,000 taxels at 50 FPS over a large area.

Result: The system enables the robot to use tactile feedback for tasks like gentle object manipulation that avoids structural damage.

Conclusion: The presented architecture is a scalable, high-performance tactile sensing solution that facilitates future research in advanced robotic manipulation and interactions.

Abstract: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is a significant
challenge, often limited by wiring complexity, data throughput, and system
reliability. This paper presents a complete architecture designed to overcome
these barriers. Our approach pairs open-source, fabric-based sensors with
custom readout electronics that reduce signal crosstalk to less than 3.3%
through hardware-based mitigation. Critically, we introduce a novel,
daisy-chained SPI bus topology that avoids the practical limitations of common
wireless protocols and the prohibitive wiring complexity of USB hub-based
systems. This architecture streams synchronized data from over 8,000 taxels
across 1 square meter of sensing area at update rates exceeding 50 FPS,
confirming its suitability for real-time control. We validate the system's
efficacy in a whole-body grasping task where, without feedback, the robot's
open-loop trajectory results in an uncontrolled application of force that
slowly crushes a deformable cardboard box. With real-time tactile feedback, the
robot transforms this motion into a gentle, stable grasp, successfully
manipulating the object without causing structural damage. This work provides a
robust and well-characterized platform to enable future research in advanced
whole-body control and physical human-robot interaction.

*Jiajie Li,Boyang Sun,Luca Di Giammarino,Hermann Blum,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActLoc enhances localization robustness in robot navigation by integrating viewpoint selection and planning mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization inaccuracies arise when robots encounter unmapped or ambiguous regions, necessitating approaches that consider viewpoint information.

Method: ActLoc uses an attention-based model trained to predict localization accuracy across different yaw and pitch directions, incorporating these distributions into a path planner for real-time adjustments.

Result: ActLoc demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in viewpoint-based localization accuracy and generalized well to trajectory planning tasks.

Conclusion: The modular approach of ActLoc ensures broad applicability across various navigation and inspection tasks, improving reliability in localization.

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

TL;DR: UltraTac integrates visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing for advanced material and object recognition on robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the limitation of visuotactile sensors, which provide tactile information but cannot perceive material features of objects.

Method: The paper designs UltraTac, a sensor combining visuotactile and ultrasound modalities using a coaxial optoacoustic architecture, ensuring structural unity and optimized sensing.

Result: UltraTac achieves proximity sensing (3-8 cm), a 99.20% accuracy rate for material classification, and a dual-mode object recognition accuracy of 92.11%.

Conclusion: UltraTac demonstrates its efficacy by aiding robotic manipulation for detecting surface and internal material features, enhancing human-machine interaction possibilities.

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors provide high-resolution tactile information but are
incapable of perceiving the material features of objects. We present UltraTac,
an integrated sensor that combines visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing
through a coaxial optoacoustic architecture. The design shares structural
components and achieves consistent sensing regions for both modalities.
Additionally, we incorporate acoustic matching into the traditional
visuotactile sensor structure, enabling integration of the ultrasound sensing
modality without compromising visuotactile performance. Through tactile
feedback, we dynamically adjust the operating state of the ultrasound module to
achieve flexible functional coordination. Systematic experiments demonstrate
three key capabilities: proximity sensing in the 3-8 cm range ($R^2=0.90$),
material classification (average accuracy: 99.20%), and texture-material
dual-mode object recognition achieving 92.11% accuracy on a 15-class task.
Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic manipulation system to
concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content, which
verifies its potential for advanced human-machine interaction and precise
robotic manipulation.

*Mateusz Jaszczuk,Nadia Figueroa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive framework that estimates dynamics mismatches online for torque-controlled robots, even in scenarios with unexpected changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With robots increasingly interacting in human environments, safe physical interactions require accurate modeling of robot dynamics. Model mismatches can lead to unsafe and task-failing behaviors.

Method: The proposed RME framework employs a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator and a Variational Inference solver to estimate dynamics mismatches from proprioceptive feedback, without external sensors.

Result: RME successfully adapts to sudden changes in the end-effector's mass and center of mass within ~400 ms on a 7-DoF manipulator, ensuring safe physical interactions.

Conclusion: RME enables fast and safe online adaptation to dynamic changes in robot end-effector dynamics, even in collaborative settings, without requiring external sensory systems.

Abstract: With robots increasingly operating in human-centric environments, ensuring
soft and safe physical interactions, whether with humans, surroundings, or
other machines, is essential. While compliant hardware can facilitate such
interactions, this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow
torque-controlled robots to safely and passively respond to contact while
accurately executing tasks. From inverse dynamics to quadratic
programming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on
accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model
mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce
Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic,
probabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online,
without relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's
proprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a
prior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the
unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator
driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden
changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$ ms, in
static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario
where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and
dynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to
changing dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory
system.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework enabling humanoid robots to play table tennis effectively, combining ball trajectory prediction with reinforcement learning-based control to achieve rapid and precise reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots have advanced in locomotion but struggle with dynamic interaction tasks—table tennis exemplifies this, requiring quick perception, prediction, and execution.

Method: The approach integrates a model-based planner for predicting ball trajectory with a reinforcement learning-based controller for coordinated whole-body movements, informed by human motion references during training.

Result: The framework was tested on humanoid robots, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human player and sustained rallies against another humanoid.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that humanoid robots can achieve real-world, interactive table tennis with sub-second reactive control, pushing the boundaries of humanoid agility and dynamic interaction.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have recently achieved impressive progress in locomotion and
whole-body control, yet they remain constrained in tasks that demand rapid
interaction with dynamic environments through manipulation. Table tennis
exemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must
perceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both
agility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for
humanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory
prediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based
whole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and
timing, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that
mimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive
rallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are
incorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose
humanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and
sustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate
real-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a
step toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors.

Motivation: Current methods of designing and constructing assembly products require a lot of manual effort and expertise. The authors aim to streamline and automate this process.

Method: Prompt-to-Product combines natural language processing for interpreting user design requirements with a bimanual robotic system for physically constructing the LEGO assemblies.

Result: A user study showed that the system effectively reduces the effort and lowers the barrier for users to create real-world assembly products.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that Prompt-to-Product successfully bridges the gap between imaginative ideas and real-world assemblies, making the design and construction process more accessible.

Abstract: Creating assembly products demands significant manual effort and expert
knowledge in 1) designing the assembly and 2) constructing the product. This
paper introduces Prompt-to-Product, an automated pipeline that generates
real-world assembly products from natural language prompts. Specifically, we
leverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of
creating brick assembly structures. Given the user design requirements,
Prompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then
leverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,
bringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user
study, and the results demonstrate that Prompt-to-Product significantly lowers
the barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from
imaginative ideas.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel online adaptive learning framework to address the sim-to-real gap by rapidly adapting control policies in the real world.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the sim-to-real gap and enhance policy robustness without relying on costly offline retraining or diverse training conditions.

Method: Uses residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a differentiable simulation framework.

Result: Improves hovering accuracy by up to 81% compared to L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while ensuring robustness in vision-based control.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables rapid, sample-efficient policy adaptations within seconds, improving robotic control performance under unseen disturbances.

Abstract: Learning control policies in simulation enables rapid, safe, and
cost-effective development of advanced robotic capabilities. However,
transferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the
sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can
degrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization
and Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle
under out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In
this work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of
relying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly
adapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve
this, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies
residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a
differentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework
refines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled
effects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics
model is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient
backpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy
updates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of
our system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to
unseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on
agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the
real world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to
L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in
vision-based control without explicit state estimation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate code for microservice-based applications, finding that performance diminishes as task complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the progress of LLMs in generating practical and functional code for real-world microservice-based applications.

Method: The study proposed a standard template and difficulty metric for microservice specifications, developed a testing framework using unit tests for LLM-generated code, and conducted experiments with the GPT-3o-mini model.

Result: LLMs perform well on medium difficulty specifications but struggle significantly with high-difficulty ones, due to complex business logic, external integrations, and non-functional requirements.

Conclusion: The research identifies key challenges LLMs face in advanced code synthesis, offering insights and future directions for improving their real-world application capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate how far LLMs have advanced in generating code for
real-world problems. Specifically, we explore code synthesis for
microservice-based applications, a widely used architecture pattern. We define
a standard template for specifying these applications, and we propose a metric
for judging the difficulty level of a specification. The higher the score, the
more difficult it is to generate code for the specification. We develop a
framework to automate the process of testing LLM-synthesized code for a
microservice using unit tests. Our experimental results show that strong LLMs
(like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do
very poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate
business logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and
inclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication. We analyzed
the errors in LLM-synthesized code and report on the key challenges LLMs face
in generating code for these specifications thereby suggesting future research
directions to improve code synthesis for real-world problems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficiency-oriented reinforcement learning framework to improve runtime performance in code generated by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generated code from large language models often lacks runtime efficiency, limiting its applicability in performance-critical scenarios.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework with a novel performance reward was developed, including dynamic exploration, error-insensitive RL methods, and methods for online exploration starting from a high-correctness baseline.

Result: The two-stage tuning method improves code correctness by 10.18% and runtime efficiency by 7.75% on a 7B model, achieving results similar to much larger models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses runtime inefficiency in generated code and improves both correctness and performance, making it viable for practical use.

Abstract: While code large language models have demonstrated remarkable progress in
code generation, the generated code often exhibits poor runtime efficiency,
limiting its practical application in performance-sensitive scenarios. To
address this limitation, we propose an efficiency-oriented reinforcement
learning framework guided by a novel performance reward. Based on this
framework, we take a deeper dive into the code efficiency problem, identifying
then proposing methods to overcome key bottlenecks: (1) Dynamic exploration
overcomes the static data constraints of offline fine-tuning, enabling the
discovery of more efficient code implementations. (2) The error-insensitive
reinforcement learning method and high-contrast efficiency signals are crucial
for mitigating systematic errors and achieving effective optimization. (3)
Online exploration is most effective when starting from a high-correctness
baseline, as this allows for efficiency improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. With these discoveries, we finally propose a two-stage tuning method,
which achieves high and balanced performance across correctness and efficiency.
The results of experiments show the effectiveness of the method, which improves
code correctness by 10.18\% and runtime efficiency by 7.75\% on a 7B model,
achieving performance comparable to much larger model.

*Maolin Sun,Yibiao Yang,Yuming Zhou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Chimera leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to create context-free grammars and Boolean term generators for syntactically valid and semantically diverse formula fuzzing in SMT solvers, efficiently discovering bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMT solvers are vital in systems and programming research, and their correctness is crucial. Traditional testing methods struggle with evolving features, necessitating advanced approaches to find bugs efficiently.

Method: Chimera uses LLMs to extract context-free grammars for SMT theories and synthesize Boolean term generators. It populates formula skeletons with LLM-generated terms for syntactic validity and diversity, with a single upfront LLM interaction.

Result: Chimera discovered 43 bugs (40 already fixed) in Z3 and cvc5 SMT solvers, highlighting its effectiveness in detecting issues.

Conclusion: Chimera achieves efficient, reliable SMT solver fuzzing through LLM-assistance, addressing past limitations and reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems
and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like
symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the
critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas
are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed
well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly
evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show
promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain:
nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative
interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In
this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that
addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the
synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly,
Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for
SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)
synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.
During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing
formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.
This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.
Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,
dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT
solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43
confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.

TL;DR: As microservice systems grow in complexity and failure frequency, RCLAgent, a novel root cause localization method, leverages a recursion-of-thought multi-agent framework to perform more accurate and efficient analysis, outperforming current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microservice systems are increasingly complex, and failures are becoming more frequent. Current root cause localization methods struggle with adapting to operational changes or lack interpretability, leaving system reliability engineers (SREs) facing challenges.

Method: The authors studied human root cause analysis techniques to identify key features like recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. They developed RCLAgent, which employs a recursion-of-thought framework, utilizes multi-agents, and integrates additional tool-assisted data analysis.

Result: RCLAgent demonstrates superior root cause localization performance on public datasets with just a single request, surpassing state-of-the-art methods that require aggregating multiple requests.

Conclusion: RCLAgent improves both the efficiency and precision of root cause localization in microservice systems, addressing limitations in adaptability and interpretability of existing techniques.

Abstract: As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and
complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained,
interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring
system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces
and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing
methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to
evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning
process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this
paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of
failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different
organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis
exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion,
and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent,
an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that
leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a
novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process,
effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to
accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public
datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing
the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art
methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore
the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root
cause localization in complex microservice environments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quality assurance framework for Large Language Model (LLM) applications by proposing a three-layer architecture for testing, identifying challenges, and establishing a communication protocol (AICL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM applications are becoming increasingly complex, integrating multi-turn interactions, tool usage, and retrieval mechanisms, which introduce challenges in quality assurance due to their non-deterministic and dynamic nature.

Method: The authors decompose LLM applications into three layers (System Shell Layer, Prompt Orchestration Layer, and LLM Inference Core) and analyze the applicability of traditional testing methods in each layer. They propose a closed-loop framework combining pre-deployment validation and runtime monitoring and introduce the AICL protocol tailored for agent communication in testing.

Result: The analysis identified six core challenges and four fundamental differences in testing LLM applications, revealing the need for paradigm shifts. The authors propose collaborative strategies and a standard protocol (AICL) aimed at improving testing rigor and integration into existing systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LLM applications demand new strategies and paradigms for quality assurance. The proposed AICL protocol and collaborative framework provide a roadmap for improving testing standards and interoperability in LLM systems.

Abstract: Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text
generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation,
tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism,
dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality
assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer
architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt
Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess
the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer:
directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at
the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference
core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software
engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community
reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics,
and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that
underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of
collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate},
and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance
framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring.
Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal
to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We
propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}}
(AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the
test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.

### [278] [From Law to Gherkin: A Human-Centred Quasi-Experiment on the Quality of LLM-Generated Behavioural Specifications from Food-Safety Regulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20744)
*Shabnam Hassani,Mehrdad Sabetzadeh,Daniel Amyot*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate developer-friendly behavioral specifications from legal texts, showing promising results in relevance, clarity, completeness, singularity, and time savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineers face challenges in translating technology-neutral legal texts into compliance artifacts manually due to labor-intensive processes, errors, and required domain expertise. Advances in generative AI provide potential automation solutions.

Method: A quasi-experimental human-subject study was conducted with 10 participants reviewing Gherkin specifications generated by LLMs Claude and Llama based on food-safety regulations. Each participant evaluated 12 specifications across criteria like relevance, clarity, completeness, singularity, and time savings.

Result: Ratings demonstrated high levels of quality: relevance (75% highest), clarity (90% highest), completeness (75% highest), singularity (82% highest), and time savings (68% highest). Further, there were no significant statistical differences between models, although specific strengths varied between Llama and Claude.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective in generating structured artifacts like Gherkin specifications from legal texts, reducing manual workload and adding value for implementation, quality assurance, and testing pipelines, though some issues like hallucinations and omissions persist.

Abstract: Context: Laws and regulations increasingly affect software design and quality
assurance, but legal texts are written in technology-neutral language. This
creates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as
requirements and acceptance criteria. Manual creation is labor-intensive,
error-prone, and requires domain expertise. Advances in Generative AI (GenAI),
especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such
artifacts.
  Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs'
ability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a
quasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements
into a developer-friendly form.
  Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety
regulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60
specifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five
criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each
specification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments.
  Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest.
Clarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second.
Singularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No
lowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences
across participants or models. Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity,
Completeness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity.
Feedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the
specifications.
  Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal
texts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for
implementation, assurance, and test generation.

*Markus Funke,Patricia Lago*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured method to address sustainability in software system architecture using a tailored architectural perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sustainability is becoming a critical quality property in software systems, yet architects lack structured guidance during the design phase.

Method: Combines a literature review using snowballing and insights from expert focus groups to develop a sustainability-oriented architectural perspective.

Result: Findings validate the importance of various elements within the sustainability perspective and point to its industrial applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed sustainability perspective offers actionable guidance for practitioners and addresses the gap in dealing with sustainability concerns effectively.

Abstract: Sustainability is increasingly recognized as an emerging quality property in
software-intensive systems, yet architects lack structured guidance to address
it effectively throughout the software design phase. Architectural
perspectives-an architectural knowledge artifact composed of concerns,
activities, tactics, pitfalls, and checklists-offer a promising approach to
tackle such emerging quality properties across architectural views and are also
independent of architecture frameworks and industry contexts. In this paper, we
present a sustainability perspective vision, i.e., a revised notion of
architectural perspective meant to be filled with its own elements to target
sustainability concerns. We formulate our sustainability perspective vision
through evidence from applying snowballing to seminal literature and from
conducting a focus group with experts in the field. Our findings confirm the
relevance of the different perspective elements in practice and highlight
implications for shaping a sustainability perspective that meets industrial
needs.

*Baharin A. Jodat,Khouloud Gaaloul,Mehrdad Sabetzadeh,Shiva Nejati*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents assertion-based test oracles for CPS that assess test outcomes without execution, featuring methods using genetic programming (GP) and decision trees (DT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulation-based testing for CPS is costly and unreliable due to flaky simulators, making automated, interpretable, and robust test oracles necessary to reduce costs and improve testing reliability.

Method: The authors propose assertion-based test oracles using logical and arithmetic predicates over system inputs. Two methods for generating these oracles are presented: (1) genetic programming with spectrum-based fault localization ranking formulas (Ochiai, Tarantula, Naish) as fitness functions, and (2) decision trees and decision rules.

Result: The GP method with the Ochiai formula produces the most accurate test oracles, outperforming Tarantula, Naish, DT, and DR approaches. These GP-generated oracles are also robust, showing only 4% variation in accuracy across systems with flaky behaviors.

Conclusion: Assertion-based test oracles using GP and Ochiai offer a robust and effective solution for testing CPS, significantly reducing costs while addressing flaky simulator challenges.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is costly due to the
time-consuming execution of CPS simulators. In addition, CPS simulators may be
flaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test
re-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not
require system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.
Ideally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human
understanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential
flakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test
oracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the
inputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test
oracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,
fails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe
two methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic
programming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization
(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness
functions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We
evaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains
of aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles
generated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those
obtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this
accuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system
under test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by
GP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in
their accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving
systems with flaky behaviours.

*Zuocheng Feng,Kaiwen Zhang,Miaomiao Wang,Yiming Cheng,Yuandao Cai,Xiaofeng Li,Guanjun Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Proposed a novel method using an improved graph neural network (GNN) and dedicated dataset to better detect and localize concurrency bugs in code, achieving remarkable improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concurrency bugs, due to improper synchronization in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are hard to detect yet pose reliability and security risks. Current deep learning methods lack sufficient datasets, semantic representation, and fine-grained debugging capability.

Method: Developed a dedicated concurrency bug dataset, enhanced deep learning with a heterogeneous GNN integrating a custom Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG), and employed SubgraphX for precise bug localization.

Result: Achieved a 10% improvement in accuracy and precision, and a 26% improvement in recall for concurrency bug detection and localization compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: This method significantly advances concurrency bug detection and debugging by providing finer-grained insights into bugs, leveraging a specialized dataset and improved graph representation for actionable results.

Abstract: Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in
multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus
compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning
methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and
dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack
sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary
classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as
precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for
effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a
dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation.
We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network
(GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that
concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further
facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method,
which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them
to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an
improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to
state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.

*Shiwen Shan,Yintong Huo,Yuxin Su,Zhining Wang,Dan Li,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConfLogger, a tool for improving software configuration diagnosability by enhancing logging practices using static taint analysis and LLM-based log generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the pervasive issues of misconfigurations and latent bugs in configurable systems by improving diagnosability through better logging practices.

Method: ConfLogger combines configuration-aware static taint analysis to trace data flow and LLM-based log generation to create diagnostic logs.

Result: ConfLogger demonstrated effectiveness in detecting misconfigurations, outperforming baseline loggers in terms of precision (+8.6%), recall (+79.3%), and F1 (+26.2%). It also achieved 100% accuracy in error localization in silent misconfiguration scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings illustrate how ConfLogger significantly enhances configuration diagnosability, improves logging practices, and assists developers in faster and more accurate troubleshooting.

Abstract: Modern configurable systems offer customization via intricate configuration
spaces, yet such flexibility introduces pervasive configuration-related issues
such as misconfigurations and latent softwarebugs. Existing diagnosability
supports focus on post-failure analysis of software behavior to identify
configuration issues, but none of these approaches look into whether the
software clue sufficient failure information for diagnosis. To fill in the
blank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging
practices at the source code level. We develop ConfLogger, the first tool that
unifies configuration-aware static taint analysis with LLM-based log generation
to enhance software configuration diagnosability. Specifically, our method 1)
identifies configuration-sensitive code segments by tracing
configuration-related data flow in the whole project, and 2) generates
diagnostic log statements by analyzing configuration code contexts. Evaluation
results on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of
ConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically,
ConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration
diagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent
misconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit
configuration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74%
coverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers
by 12% and 30%. It also gains 8.6% higher in precision, 79.3% higher in recall,
and 26.2% higher in F1 compared to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of
variable logging while also augmenting diagnostic value. A controlled user
study on 22 cases further validated its utility, speeding up diagnostic time by
1.25x and improving troubleshooting accuracy by 251.4%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to investigate gender biases within software engineering due to its dual roots in engineering and computer science.

Method: It involves both qualitative profiling of key figures in the field and quantitative analyses of gender representation in research authorship at a major conference over three decades.

Result: The analysis revealed statistically significant periods of gender exclusion in women's participation as research conference authors.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the existence of gender bias and encourage research-informed policies to mitigate these biases in computing and software engineering.

Abstract: The field of software engineering is embedded in both engineering and
computer science, and may embody gender biases endemic to both. This paper
surveys software engineering's origins and its long-running attention to
engineering professionalism, profiling five leaders; it then examines the
field's recent attention to gender issues and gender bias. It next
quantitatively analyzes women's participation as research authors in the
field's leading International Conference of Software Engineering (1976-2010),
finding a dozen years with statistically significant gender exclusion. Policy
dimensions of research on gender bias in computing are suggested.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified theory combining Bayesian cognitive models with sexual selection to explain language's evolution and features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the major facets of language, including speed, expressivity, diversity, and pragmatics, while incorporating its evolutionary roots.

Method: The method integrates Construction Grammars with Bayesian unification processes and graph-like feature structures for fast learning and application.

Result: The theory accounts for seamless computation across language aspects and evolutionary links between human and animal cognition.

Conclusion: Language processing is deeply tied to human cognition and societal foundations, emphasizing its evolutionary and computational significance.

Abstract: A unified theory of language combines a Bayesian cognitive linguistic model
of language processing, with the proposal that language evolved by sexual
selection for the display of intelligence. The theory accounts for the major
facts of language, including its speed and expressivity, and data on language
diversity, pragmatics, syntax and semantics. The computational element of the
theory is based on Construction Grammars. These give an account of the syntax
and semantics of the worlds languages, using constructions and unification. Two
novel elements are added to construction grammars: an account of language
pragmatics, and an account of fast, precise language learning. Constructions
are represented in the mind as graph like feature structures. People use slow
general inference to understand the first few examples they hear of any
construction. After that it is learned as a feature structure, and is rapidly
applied by unification. All aspects of language (phonology, syntax, semantics,
and pragmatics) are seamlessly computed by fast unification; there is no
boundary between semantics and pragmatics. This accounts for the major puzzles
of pragmatics, and for detailed pragmatic phenomena. Unification is Bayesian
maximum likelihood pattern matching. This gives evolutionary continuity between
language processing in the human brain, and Bayesian cognition in animal
brains. Language is the basis of our mind reading abilities, our cooperation,
self esteem and emotions; the foundations of human culture and society.

*Alex B. Kiefer*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of entropy maximization in defining motivation and values in AI systems and contrasts it with biological agents. It highlights the shortcomings in simulated agents, such as reward hacking, due to the lack of endogenous motivation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need to understand the foundations of motivation and value alignment in AI systems, drawing parallels with biological agents that utilize entropy for action generation.

Method: The author uses theoretical analysis to explore entropy maximization, energetic constraints, and the interplay between cognitive and physical dynamics in both AI systems and biological agents.

Result: It demonstrates that biological agents integrate thermodynamic computation in a way that generates true motivation, while simulated AI systems lack this endogenous basis and exhibit issues like reward hacking.

Conclusion: The essence of desire, motivation, and value lies in the thermodynamic computation of living agents, and the absence of this in AI systems signals potential pitfalls and misalignments such as reward hacking.

Abstract: I consider motivation and value-alignment in AI systems from the perspective
of (constrained) entropy maximization. Though the structures encoding knowledge
in any physical system can be understood as energetic constraints, only living
agents harness entropy in the endogenous generation of actions. I argue that
this exploitation of "mortal" or thermodynamic computation, in which cognitive
and physical dynamics are inseparable, is of the essence of desire, motivation,
and value, while the lack of true endogenous motivation in simulated "agents"
predicts pathologies like reward hacking.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates stochastic gradient algorithms for learning problems with unknown nuisance parameters, providing non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. It finds that these algorithms can converge under appropriate conditions like Neyman orthogonality, or via approximately orthogonalized updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge posed by nuisance parameters in stochastic gradient optimization and establish convergence guarantees in these scenarios.

Method: The paper studies stochastic gradient algorithms in contexts with nuisance parameters, deriving theoretical proofs and leveraging techniques like Neyman orthogonality and approximate orthogonalization to assess convergence behavior.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that stochastic gradient algorithms can converge despite nuisance parameters, either with Neyman orthogonality or an algorithm variant using an approximately orthogonalized gradient.

Conclusion: Stochastic gradient techniques remain viable in scenarios with nuisance parameters, provided certain conditions or algorithmic adjustments like gradient orthogonalization are met.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is the dominant learning paradigm for a
variety of scenarios, from classical supervised learning to modern
self-supervised learning. We consider stochastic gradient algorithms for
learning problems whose objectives rely on unknown nuisance parameters, and
establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Our results show that, while
the presence of a nuisance can alter the optimum and upset the optimization
trajectory, the classical stochastic gradient algorithm may still converge
under appropriate conditions, such as Neyman orthogonality. Moreover, even when
Neyman orthogonality is not satisfied, we show that an algorithm variant with
approximately orthogonalized updates (with an approximately orthogonalized
gradient oracle) may achieve similar convergence rates. Examples from
orthogonal statistical learning/double machine learning and causal inference
are discussed.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces self-consistency (SC) loss to enhance probabilistic model comparisons using neural surrogates, especially under distribution shifts, but its efficacy depends on the likelihood accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reliability deterioration of neural surrogates in Bayesian model comparison caused by simulation model misspecification, particularly under empirical distribution shifts.

Method: Proposes supplementing simulation-based training with self-consistency (SC) loss applied to unlabeled real data to refine the Bayesian model comparison estimates.

Result: SC improves calibration under analytically accessible likelihoods in cases of model misspecification but shows limited effectiveness when neural surrogate likelihoods are involved.

Conclusion: Self-consistency loss offers a practical enhancement for Bayesian model comparison but is most effective and trustworthy when dealing with exact likelihoods.

Abstract: Amortized Bayesian model comparison (BMC) enables fast probabilistic ranking
of models via simulation-based training of neural surrogates. However, the
reliability of neural surrogates deteriorates when simulation models are
misspecified - the very case where model comparison is most needed. Thus, we
supplement simulation-based training with a self-consistency (SC) loss on
unlabeled real data to improve BMC estimates under empirical distribution
shifts. Using a numerical experiment and two case studies with real data, we
compare amortized evidence estimates with and without SC against analytic or
bridge sampling benchmarks. SC improves calibration under model
misspecification when having access to analytic likelihoods. However, it offers
limited gains with neural surrogate likelihoods, making it most practical for
trustworthy BMC when likelihoods are exact.

### [288] [Polynomial Chaos Expansion for Operator Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20886)
*Himanshu Sharma,Lukáš Novák,Michael D. Shields*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) framework for operator learning (OL), which approximates mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces, such as PDE solution operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing operator learning methods rely heavily on deep neural networks like DeepONet and FNO, but there is potential to explore classical machine learning techniques for simpler and potentially more efficient OL methods.

Method: The authors implement PCE by formulating a mathematical framework capable of approximating operators in data-driven and physics-informed contexts. It involves solving equations for PCE coefficients and provides uncertainty quantification through post-processing.

Result: The proposed method shows high performance in operator learning (accuracy and computational efficiency) and uncertainty quantification when applied to various PDE problems.

Conclusion: PCE-based frameworks are effective for operator learning tasks and provide uncertainty quantification with no extra computational cost, making it a competitive alternative to deep learning-based approaches.

Abstract: Operator learning (OL) has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific machine
learning (SciML) for approximating mappings between infinite-dimensional
functional spaces. One of its main applications is learning the solution
operator of partial differential equations (PDEs). While much of the progress
in this area has been driven by deep neural network-based approaches such as
Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), recent
work has begun to explore traditional machine learning methods for OL. In this
work, we introduce polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) as an OL method. PCE has
been widely used for uncertainty quantification (UQ) and has recently gained
attention in the context of SciML. For OL, we establish a mathematical
framework that enables PCE to approximate operators in both purely data-driven
and physics-informed settings. The proposed framework reduces the task of
learning the operator to solving a system of equations for the PCE
coefficients. Moreover, the framework provides UQ by simply post-processing the
PCE coefficients, without any additional computational cost. We apply the
proposed method to a diverse set of PDE problems to demonstrate its
capabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the strong performance of the
proposed method in both OL and UQ tasks, achieving excellent numerical accuracy
and computational efficiency.

Result: The paper demonstrates the method's wide applicability, including optimal individualized treatment rules, and validates its superior performance and robustness through extensive simulations and real-world data analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides a consistent, robust, and high-performing approach for transfer learning in decision rule modeling, with applications demonstrated in treatment rule estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the transfer learning classification framework from
regression function-based methods to decision rules. We propose a novel
methodology for modeling posterior drift through Bayes decision rules. By
exploiting the geometric transformation of the Bayes decision boundary, our
method reformulates the problem as a low-dimensional empirical risk
minimization problem. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish the
consistency of our estimators and derive the risk bounds. Moreover, we
illustrate the broad applicability of our method by adapting it to the
estimation of optimal individualized treatment rules. Extensive simulation

### [290] [OLMoASR: Open Models and Data for Training Robust Speech Recognition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20869)
*Huong Ngo,Matt Deitke,Martijn Bartelds,Sarah Pratt,Josh Gardner,Matt Jordan,Ludwig Schmidt*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces OLMoASR, a robust speech recognition system trained on a large curated dataset (OLMoASR-Mix) with performance competitive to OpenAI's Whisper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the influence of high-quality training data in speech recognition, addressing the gap left by previous advancements in data scale and quality.

Method: They collected 3M hours of audio and 17M transcripts, applied heuristic filters to curate high-quality pairs (OLMoASR-Mix), and trained models ranging in parameter sizes from 39M to 1.5B.

Result: The OLMoASR models achieved comparable word error rates to Whisper's models across benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness at different model scales.

Conclusion: The publicly available dataset, models, and associated code solidify OLMoASR as a foundation for further research in zero-shot speech recognition.

Abstract: Improvements in training data scale and quality have led to significant
advances, yet its influence in speech recognition remains underexplored. In
this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, and series of
models, OLMoASR, to study and develop robust zero-shot speech recognition
models. Beginning from OLMoASR-Pool, a collection of 3M hours of English audio
and 17M transcripts, we design text heuristic filters to remove low-quality or
mistranscribed data. Our curation pipeline produces a new dataset containing 1M
hours of high-quality audio-transcript pairs, which we call OLMoASR-Mix. We use
OLMoASR-Mix to train the OLMoASR-Mix suite of models, ranging from 39M
(tiny.en) to 1.5B (large.en) parameters. Across all model scales, OLMoASR
achieves comparable average performance to OpenAI's Whisper on short and
long-form speech recognition benchmarks. Notably, OLMoASR-medium.en attains a
12.8\% and 11.0\% word error rate (WER) that is on par with Whisper's largest
English-only model Whisper-medium.en's 12.4\% and 10.5\% WER for short and
long-form recognition respectively (at equivalent parameter count).
OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and filtering, training and evaluation code will
be made publicly available to further research on robust speech processing.

### [291] [Flowing Straighter with Conditional Flow Matching for Accurate Speech Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20584)
*Mattias Cross,Anton Ragni*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of straight versus curved probability paths on generative speech enhancement quality. It proposes a new method called conditional flow matching to achieve straighter paths and offers a one-step inference solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based generative speech enhancement methods rely on curved probability paths, but their implications are unclear. Findings suggest straight paths may offer easier training and better generalization.

Method: The paper quantifies path straightness for speech enhancement by experimenting with the Schrodinger bridge and proposes independent conditional flow-matching, modeling straight paths between noisy and clean speech.

Result: Empirical results show that time-independent variance has a greater impact on sample quality than gradient. Conditional flow matching improves speech quality metrics but requires multiple inference steps, addressed by a proposed one-step solution.

Conclusion: Straight time-independent probability paths are more effective for generative speech enhancement compared to curved time-dependent paths.

Abstract: Current flow-based generative speech enhancement methods learn curved
probability paths which model a mapping between clean and noisy speech. Despite
impressive performance, the implications of curved probability paths are
unknown. Methods such as Schrodinger bridges focus on curved paths, where
time-dependent gradients and variance do not promote straight paths. Findings
in machine learning research suggest that straight paths, such as conditional
flow matching, are easier to train and offer better generalisation. In this
paper we quantify the effect of path straightness on speech enhancement
quality. We report experiments with the Schrodinger bridge, where we show that
certain configurations lead to straighter paths. Conversely, we propose
independent conditional flow-matching for speech enhancement, which models
straight paths between noisy and clean speech. We demonstrate empirically that
a time-independent variance has a greater effect on sample quality than the
gradient. Although conditional flow matching improves several speech quality
metrics, it requires multiple inference steps. We rectify this with a one-step
solution by inferring the trained flow-based model as if it was directly
predictive. Our work suggests that straighter time-independent probability
paths improve generative speech enhancement over curved time-dependent paths.

### [292] [Amadeus: Autoregressive Model with Bidirectional Attribute Modelling for Symbolic Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20665)
*Hongju Su,Ke Li,Lan Yang,Honggang Zhang,Yi-Zhe Song*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Amadeus introduces a novel two-level model for symbolic music generation, improving performance and offering better control over note attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlighting flaws in current state-of-the-art music generation models that treat note attributes as sequentially dependent, despite evidence suggesting they function as unordered sets.

Method: Amadeus uses an autoregressive model for note sequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes, enhanced by MLSDES and CIEM for better music representation and decoding.

Result: Amadeus outperforms existing models in both unconditional and text-conditioned tasks, achieves 4x speed-ups, and allows training-free manipulations of note attributes.

Conclusion: The research not only demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness of the Amadeus framework but also provides a large-scale Amadeus MIDI Dataset for extended application possibilities.

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art symbolic music generation models predominantly
adopt autoregressive or hierarchical autoregressive architectures, modelling
symbolic music as a sequence of attribute tokens with unidirectional temporal
dependencies, under the assumption of a fixed, strict dependency structure
among these attributes. However, we observe that using different attributes as
the initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This
suggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent
and unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this
insight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework.
Amadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note
sequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To
enhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement
Strategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify
discriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional
Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent
vector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note
decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and
text-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA
models across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\times$ speed-up.
Furthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control
feasibility using our model. To explore the upper performance bound of the
Amadeus architecture, we compile the largest open-source symbolic music dataset
to date, AMD (Amadeus MIDI Dataset), supporting both pre-training and
fine-tuning.

### [293] [Unified Multi-task Learning for Voice-Based Detection of Diverse Clinical Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20717)
*Ran Piao,Yuan Lu,Hareld Kemps,Tong Xia,Aaqib Saeed*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MARVEL, a multitask learning framework, uses acoustic features from voice data to screen for nine health disorders, achieving strong diagnostic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable and non-invasive voice-based diagnostic tool capable of screening multiple health conditions simultaneously.

Method: A multitask learning model using derived acoustic features with dual-branch architecture enabling cross-condition knowledge transfer.

Result: MARVEL achieved AUROC of 0.78 overall and performed exceptionally well on tasks like Alzheimer's disease with an AUROC of 0.97.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential for unified voice-based diagnostic models, suitable for remote and resource-limited healthcare applications.

Abstract: Voice-based health assessment offers unprecedented opportunities for
scalable, non-invasive disease screening, yet existing approaches typically
focus on single conditions and fail to leverage the rich, multi-faceted
information embedded in speech. We present MARVEL (Multi-task Acoustic
Representations for Voice-based Health Analysis), a privacy-conscious multitask
learning framework that simultaneously detects nine distinct neurological,
respiratory, and voice disorders using only derived acoustic features,
eliminating the need for raw audio transmission. Our dual-branch architecture
employs specialized encoders with task-specific heads sharing a common acoustic
backbone, enabling effective cross-condition knowledge transfer. Evaluated on
the large-scale Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset, MARVEL achieves an overall AUROC
of 0.78, with exceptional performance on neurological disorders (AUROC = 0.89),
particularly for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (AUROC = 0.97).
Our framework consistently outperforms single-modal baselines by 5-19% and
surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised models on 7 of 9 tasks, while
correlation analysis reveals that the learned representations exhibit
meaningful similarities with established acoustic features, indicating that the
model's internal representations are consistent with clinically recognized
acoustic patterns. By demonstrating that a single unified model can effectively
screen for diverse conditions, this work establishes a foundation for
deployable voice-based diagnostics in resource-constrained and remote
healthcare settings.

### [294] [Speech Emotion Recognition via Entropy-Aware Score Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20796)
*ChenYi Chua,JunKai Wong,Chengxin Chen,Xiaoxiao Miao*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal framework for speech emotion recognition using entropy-aware score selection to combine predictions from speech and text models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve speech emotion recognition by leveraging multimodal information while addressing confidence constraints in single-modality systems.

Method: The framework integrates an acoustic model (wav2vec2.0), a sentiment analysis model (RoBERTa-XLM), and uses Whisper-large-v3 for transcription, employing late score fusion with entropy thresholds.

Result: Experiments on the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets demonstrate enhanced performance compared to traditional single-modality approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal method effectively improves emotion recognition accuracy and reliability by combining speech and text predictions innovatively.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework for speech emotion
recognition that leverages entropy-aware score selection to combine speech and
textual predictions. The proposed method integrates a primary pipeline that
consists of an acoustic model based on wav2vec2.0 and a secondary pipeline that
consists of a sentiment analysis model using RoBERTa-XLM, with transcriptions
generated via Whisper-large-v3. We propose a late score fusion approach based
on entropy and varentropy thresholds to overcome the confidence constraints of
primary pipeline predictions. A sentiment mapping strategy translates three
sentiment categories into four target emotion classes, enabling coherent
integration of multimodal predictions. The results on the IEMOCAP and
MSP-IMPROV datasets show that the proposed method offers a practical and
reliable enhancement over traditional single-modality systems.

### [295] [Learning Robust Spatial Representations from Binaural Audio through Feature Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20914)
*Holger Severin Bovbjerg,Jan Østergaard,Jesper Jensen,Shinji Watanabe,Zheng-Hua Tan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper explores unsupervised pretraining to learn spatial representations from binaural audio for Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation, yielding robust models that outperform traditional methods under adverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration in learning spatial representations from multichannel audio using deep learning, particularly for binaural audio and under challenging noisy or reverberant conditions.

Method: The paper introduces a pretraining framework that uses feature distillation on binaural speech. Clean spatial features are predicted from augmented speech using a neural network. The encoder weights obtained in pretraining are later fine-tuned for DoA estimation.

Result: The pretrained models, after fine-tuning, outperform fully supervised models and classical signal processing methods in noisy and reverberant environments.

Conclusion: Unsupervised pretraining using feature distillation can effectively learn robust spatial representations for binaural audio, improving DoA estimation performance under challenging acoustic conditions.

Abstract: Recently, deep representation learning has shown strong performance in
multiple audio tasks. However, its use for learning spatial representations
from multichannel audio is underexplored. We investigate the use of a
pretraining stage based on feature distillation to learn a robust spatial
representation of binaural speech without the need for data labels. In this
framework, spatial features are computed from clean binaural speech samples to
form prediction labels. These clean features are then predicted from
corresponding augmented speech using a neural network. After pretraining, we
throw away the spatial feature predictor and use the learned encoder weights to
initialize a DoA estimation model which we fine-tune for DoA estimation. Our
experiments demonstrate that the pretrained models show improved performance in
noisy and reverberant environments after fine-tuning for direction-of-arrival
estimation, when compared to fully supervised models and classic signal
processing methods.

### [296] [WoW-Bench: Evaluating Fine-Grained Acoustic Perception in Audio-Language Models via Marine Mammal Vocalizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20976)
*Jaeyeon Kim,Heeseung Yun,Sang Hoon Woo,Chao-Han Huck Yang,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The study introduces the World-of-Whale (WoW-Bench) benchmark to evaluate large audio language models' (LALMs) capabilities in low-level auditory tasks using marine mammal vocalizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LALMs' ability to perform fine-grained auditory perception and cognition tasks, especially in real-world scenarios involving unfamiliar sounds.

Method: The WoW-Bench benchmark includes a Perception section for categorizing sounds and a Cognition section inspired by Bloom's taxonomy to test remembering, understanding, applying, and analyzing sounds. Distractor questions evaluate true auditory problem-solving.

Result: State-of-the-art LALMs perform significantly below human levels in the WoW-Bench evaluation, showcasing their limited auditory grounding.

Conclusion: Stronger auditory grounding techniques are necessary for LALMs to improve their performance in low-level auditory tasks and cognition.

Abstract: Large audio language models (LALMs) extend language understanding into the
auditory domain, yet their ability to perform low-level listening, such as
pitch and duration detection, remains underexplored. However, low-level
listening is critical for real-world, out-of-distribution tasks where models
must reason about unfamiliar sounds based on fine-grained acoustic cues. To
address this gap, we introduce the World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) to
evaluate low-level auditory perception and cognition using marine mammal
vocalizations. WoW-bench is composed of a Perception benchmark for categorizing
novel sounds and a Cognition benchmark, inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, to assess
the abilities to remember, understand, apply, and analyze sound events. For the
Cognition benchmark, we additionally introduce distractor questions to evaluate
whether models are truly solving problems through listening rather than relying
on other heuristics. Experiments with state-of-the-art LALMs show performance
far below human levels, indicating a need for stronger auditory grounding in
LALMs.

### [297] [Graph-Based Feature Augmentation for Predictive Tasks on Relational Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20986)
*Lianpeng Qiao,Ziqi Cao,Kaiyu Feng,Ye Yuan,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReCoGNN, an automated feature augmentation framework designed to enhance relational datasets for predictive tasks using graph neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce manual effort in predictive modeling over relational tables by automating feature augmentation and uncovering task-specific relational signals.

Method: ReCoGNN operates in three steps: modeling intra-table attribute relationships to segment tables semantically, constructing a heterogeneous weighted graph for inter-row relationships, and employing graph neural networks for feature propagation and selection.

Result: ReCoGNN demonstrates superior performance in classification and regression tasks across ten real-life and synthetic datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively automates feature augmentation and improves prediction accuracy, making it valuable for AutoML applications in domains like finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.

### [298] [Research Challenges in Relational Database Management Systems for LLM Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20912)
*Kerem Akillioglu,Anurag Chakraborty,Sairaj Voruganti,M. Tamer Özsu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper explores the integration of large language models (LLMs) into database systems via SQL queries, highlighting challenges like structured outputs and resource optimization, ultimately demonstrating the potential for improved LLM+DBMS integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have become critical for various text-related applications and are being integrated into database systems to enable advanced data processing. Open-source options currently lag in functionality and performance. The paper aims to address these gaps.

Method: The authors evaluated two open-source systems and one enterprise platform using five representative queries to examine functionality, performance, and scalability challenges in SQL-invoked LLM integration.

Result: The study identified key issues such as structured output enforcement, resource optimization, and better query planning. Implementation of initial solutions led to improvements in handling LLM-powered SQL queries.

Conclusion: Tighter integration of LLMs into database management systems can enable efficient, scalable processing and unlock the full potential of LLM queries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as
text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering.
Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly
within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,
open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source
systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to
expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked
LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,
optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented
initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL
queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is
the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

### [299] [Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock Price Data via Return-Volatility Normalization for Accurate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20108)
*Hyunwoo Lee,Jihyeong Jeon,Jaemin Hong,U Kang*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReVol, a method to improve stock price prediction by tackling distribution shifts using normalization, attention mechanisms, and hybrid modeling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the challenge of accurately predicting stock prices amid distribution shifts, which hinder the effectiveness of existing methods and limit their ability to adapt to discrepancies between training and test data.

Method: ReVol employs three strategies: normalization of sample-specific price features, an attention-based estimation module to reduce market anomalies, and reintegration of sample characteristics post-normalization. It combines geometric Brownian motion for long-term trend modeling with neural networks for short-term pattern recognition.

Result: ReVol significantly enhances prediction accuracy across most backbone models, attaining an average improvement of over 0.03 in IC and 0.7 in SR on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: By explicitly addressing distribution shifts, ReVol provides a robust and unified approach for stock price prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: How can we address distribution shifts in stock price data to improve stock
price prediction accuracy? Stock price prediction has attracted attention from
both academia and industry, driven by its potential to uncover complex market
patterns and enhance decisionmaking. However, existing methods often fail to
handle distribution shifts effectively, focusing on scaling or representation
adaptation without fully addressing distributional discrepancies and shape
misalignments between training and test data. We propose ReVol
(Return-Volatility Normalization for Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock
Price Data), a robust method for stock price prediction that explicitly
addresses the distribution shift problem. ReVol leverages three key strategies
to mitigate these shifts: (1) normalizing price features to remove
sample-specific characteristics, including return, volatility, and price scale,
(2) employing an attention-based module to estimate these characteristics
accurately, thereby reducing the influence of market anomalies, and (3)
reintegrating the sample characteristics into the predictive process, restoring
the traits lost during normalization. Additionally, ReVol combines geometric
Brownian motion for long-term trend modeling with neural networks for
short-term pattern recognition, unifying their complementary strengths.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ReVol enhances
the performance of the state-of-the-art backbone models in most cases,
achieving an average improvement of more than 0.03 in IC and over 0.7 in SR
across various settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for accurate molecular property predictions, exploration of chemical spaces, and integration of these insights into chemical process engineering effectively.

Method: It reviews state-of-the-art molecular ML models like graph neural networks and transformers and explores their hybridization with physicochemical principles. The paper also delves into leveraging molecular ML at the chemical process scale.

Result: Molecular ML shows great potential in improving molecular property predictions and aiding in the discovery of new molecules and processes, though its integration into process workflows remains underexplored.

Conclusion: Advancements in molecular ML, especially in hybrid and physics-informed methods, can revolutionize chemical process engineering. Collaborative benchmarks and validations with the industry are critical for practical impact.

Abstract: We present a perspective on molecular machine learning (ML) in the field of
chemical process engineering. Recently, molecular ML has demonstrated great
potential in (i) providing highly accurate predictions for properties of pure
components and their mixtures, and (ii) exploring the chemical space for new
molecular structures. We review current state-of-the-art molecular ML models
and discuss research directions that promise further advancements. This
includes ML methods, such as graph neural networks and transformers, which can
be further advanced through the incorporation of physicochemical knowledge in a
hybrid or physics-informed fashion. Then, we consider leveraging molecular ML
at the chemical process scale, which is highly desirable yet rather unexplored.
We discuss how molecular ML can be integrated into process design and
optimization formulations, promising to accelerate the identification of novel
molecules and processes. To this end, it will be essential to create molecule
and process design benchmarks and practically validate proposed candidates,
possibly in collaboration with the chemical industry.

*Boaz Taitler,Omer Ben-Porat*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper explores how Generative AI impacts worker collaboration in team settings, offering both productivity boosts and labor replacement concerns. A theoretical model analyzes the manager's decisions, worker efforts, and effects on overall output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how Generative AI reshapes team collaborations and contributes to strategic decisions in workplaces, especially under considerations of productivity and effort optimization.

Method: The paper employs a theoretical framework modeling team dynamics, introduces the manager's NP-complete optimization problem, designs an algorithm for linear-class instances, and supplements results with simulations.

Result: Finds that Generative AI may lead workers to exert no effort even under limited effectiveness, highlights critical roles of low-value workers, and identifies optimal team selection challenges for managers.

Conclusion: Excessive reliance on GenAI risks diminishing worker participation and overall output stability, suggesting that careful managerial decisions are crucial to avoid negative effects.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping how workers contribute to
shared projects. While workers can use GenAI to boost productivity or reduce
effort, managers may use it to replace some workers entirely. We present a
theoretical framework to analyze how GenAI affects collaboration in such
settings. In our model, the manager selects a team to work on a shared task,
with GenAI substituting for unselected workers. Each worker selects how much
effort to exert, and incurs a cost that increases with the level of effort. We
show that GenAI can lead workers to exert no effort, even if GenAI is almost
ineffective. We further show that the manager's optimization problem is
NP-complete, and provide an efficient algorithm for the special class of
(almost-) linear instances. Our analysis shows that even workers with low
individual value may play a critical role in sustaining overall output, and
excluding such workers can trigger a cascade. Finally, we conduct extensive
simulations to illustrate our theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive pricing strategy for ride-pooling systems, demonstrating over 90% accuracy in predicting individual price acceptance within 10 days.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of determining acceptable prices for ride-pooling customers who have diverse and unknown value-of-time preferences.

Method: Proposed an adaptive pricing policy where daily offers are tailored based on travellers' evolving acceptance data, enabling personalised fare optimisation.

Result: Demonstrated the ability to learn individual price acceptance levels with over 90% accuracy within 10 days. This benefits both operators and travellers by improving demand attraction, utility, and profitability.

Conclusion: Learning individual behavioural traits enables ride-pooling operators to optimise fare pricing, enhance overall system efficiency, and achieve higher traveller satisfaction and increased operator profits.

Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely
compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a
strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable
price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels
can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in
$10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing
policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively
meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results
suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual
travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility)
but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the
operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and
profitable combinations.

*Zizhao Tang,Changhao Liu,Nuo Tong,Shuiping Gou,Mei Shi*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework combining CT images, radiomics, and clinical data to predict metastasis risk in HNSCC patients, achieving high accuracy and showing potential as a clinical decision tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metastasis is a significant clinical challenge in treating HNSCC. Reliable risk prediction before treatment is essential for personalized treatment planning and improving prognosis.

Method: A multimodal framework integrating CT images, radiomics features, and clinical data. Features were extracted via a 3D Swin Transformer, filtered and selected, then fused into a predictive deep learning model evaluated using cross-validation metrics.

Result: The multimodal fusion model achieved superior predictive performance (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758) compared to single-modality approaches. Stratification confirmed generalizability, and ablation studies validated modality complementarity.

Conclusion: The model demonstrated robust and accurate risk prediction for metastasis in HNSCC patients, with potential to support clinical decisions and tailor treatment plans based on interpretable tumor biology analysis.

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of
metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.
This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict
metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)
images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor
and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer
extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features
were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random
forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,
smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived
features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to
predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold
cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity
(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed
single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of
0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive
performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).
Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation
studies indicated complementary information from different modalities.
Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation
learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated
high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a
comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has
potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment
planning.

### [305] [Studying Effective String Theory using deep generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20610)
*Michele Caselle,Elia Cellini,Alessandro Nada*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: Effective String Theory (EST) provides a framework for confinement in Yang-Mills theory using vibrating strings, and deep learning is applied to address analytical challenges like flux tube width.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of applying analytical solutions to complex problems, particularly determining the flux tube width in Effective String Theory.

Method: The researchers utilized a combination of Effective String Theory and deep learning techniques based on generative algorithms to numerically explore the theory.

Result: The application of deep learning provided data and results for determining the flux tube width within the Nambu-Gotō EST.

Conclusion: Using deep learning generative techniques offers a new numerical approach to understanding and solving complex problems in Effective String Theory.

Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) offers a robust non-perturbative framework for
describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory by treating the confining flux tube
between a static quark-antiquark pair as a thin, vibrating string. While EST
calculations are typically carried out using zeta-function regularization,
certain problems-such as determining the flux tube width-are too complex to
solve analytically. However, recent studies have demonstrated that EST can be
explored numerically by employing deep learning techniques based on generative
algorithms. In this work, we provide a brief introduction to EST and this novel
numerical approach. Finally, we present results for the width of the
Nambu-Got\"o EST.

*Andrew Yarovoi,Christopher R. Valenta*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage point cloud segmentation pipeline improving performance using pre-training and fine-tuning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust point cloud segmentation in low-data scenarios for unimproved roads and other classes while maximizing generalization.

Method: A two-stage framework starting with projection-based CNN pre-training on mixed datasets, followed by in-domain fine-tuning. Includes Point Prompt, Manifold Mixup, and histogram-normalized ambients methods.

Result: Using 50 labeled point clouds, performance improved from 33.5% to 51.8% mean Intersection-over-Union and 85.5% to 90.8% overall accuracy.

Conclusion: Pre-training across multiple datasets significantly boosts generalization, aiding practical 3D semantic segmentation in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: In this case study, we present a data-efficient point cloud segmentation
pipeline and training framework for robust segmentation of unimproved roads and
seven other classes. Our method employs a two-stage training framework: first,
a projection-based convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a mixture of
public urban datasets and a small, curated in-domain dataset; then, a
lightweight prediction head is fine-tuned exclusively on in-domain data. Along
the way, we explore the application of Point Prompt Training to batch
normalization layers and the effects of Manifold Mixup as a regularizer within
our pipeline. We also explore the effects of incorporating histogram-normalized
ambients to further boost performance. Using only 50 labeled point clouds from
our target domain, we show that our proposed training approach improves mean
Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and the overall accuracy from 85.5%
to 90.8%, when compared to naive training on the in-domain data. Crucially, our
results demonstrate that pre-training across multiple datasets is key to
improving generalization and enabling robust segmentation under limited
in-domain supervision. Overall, this study demonstrates a practical framework
for robust 3D semantic segmentation in challenging, low-data scenarios. Our

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has advanced rapidly over the past two decades,
largely driven by deep learning, which has enabled accurate and efficient
delineation of cells, tissues, organs, and pathologies across diverse imaging
modalities. This progress raises a fundamental question: to what extent have
current models overcome persistent challenges, and what gaps remain? In this
work, we provide an in-depth review of medical image segmentation, tracing its
progress and key developments over the past decade. We examine core principles,
including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of
prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder
components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven
key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning,
(2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3)
advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of
foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to
probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D
segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents.
Together, these perspectives provide a holistic overview of the trajectory of
deep learning-based medical image segmentation and aim to inspire future
innovation. To support ongoing research, we maintain a continually updated

### [309] [A Machine Learning Approach to Volumetric Computations of Solid Pulmonary Nodules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20127)
*Yihan Zhou,Haocheng Huang,Yue Yu,Jianhui Shang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study proposes a new deep learning framework for precise and fast volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans to aid early lung cancer detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of lung cancer necessitates accurate, efficient assessment methods for pulmonary nodules, overcoming limitations of traditional techniques like CTR and spherical approximation.

Method: A multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) integrated with subtype-specific bias correction was used for precise nodule volume estimation, trained on 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital.

Result: The framework achieved a mean absolute deviation of 8.0% versus manual regression and inference time of under 20 seconds per scan, outperforming existing methods with errors of 25-30% and longer processing durations.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a scalable, highly accurate, and efficient tool for lung nodule screening, significantly enhancing early lung cancer detection capabilities.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies
on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional
methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical
approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in
nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a
multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias
correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated
on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a
mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression,
with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms
existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have
errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our
results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold
acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate,
efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring,
with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.

### [310] [Efficient and Privacy-Protecting Background Removal for 2D Video Streaming using iPhone 15 Pro Max LiDAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20250)
*Jessica Kinnevan,Naifa Alqahtani,Toral Chauhan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores using LiDAR technology in consumer mobile devices, like the iPhone 15 Pro Max, for background removal and compositing in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in current background removal techniques, which depend on conditions like lighting or AI model training, by leveraging LiDAR's depth information capabilities.

Method: The authors combined LiDAR depth sensors and color cameras within the iPhone 15 Pro Max. They utilized SwiftUI for the interface, Swift for backend processes, and Metal Shader Language for real-time image enhancement.

Result: Their system achieved effective real-time background removal at 60 frames per second, although depth data resolution is constrained to 320x240 by current device streaming limitations.

Conclusion: LiDAR technology offers a promising alternative for background removal, but future improvements in LiDAR resolution on mobile devices are necessary for optimal results.

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile
devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and
compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI
models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and
performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the
LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image
processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and
backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image
enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per
second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming
bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution
to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect
accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device
like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR
could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video
applications and photography.

TL;DR: GENRE-CMR is a GAN-based architecture designed to improve accelerated CMR image reconstruction, achieving superior quality and generalization across diverse acquisition settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome trade-offs between scan time and image quality in CMR image reconstruction, enabling better generalization across diverse acquisition settings.

Method: A residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework integrated with two loss functions: Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss for structural preservation and Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss for feature space regularization.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with 0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions, and effectively confirmed contributions of individual components via ablation studies.

Conclusion: GENRE-CMR offers a unified and robust solution for high-quality CMR reconstruction, enabling clinical adaptability across different acquisition protocols.

Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction
remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image
quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We
propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture
employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance
reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative
optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with
residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to
deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions:
(1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on
structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction
blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which
regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric
KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR
surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving
0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various
acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the
contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and
generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for
high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable
deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study evaluates the DINOv3-H+ vision transformer for classification of atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) achieving a strong result (balanced accuracy 0.8871) on the test dataset of MIDOG 2025 using fine-tuning and augmentation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty in detecting atypical mitotic figures (AMFs), which are significant markers of poor prognosis, by introducing an effective method that can overcome challenges such as subtle morphology, low prevalence, and variability in human assessment.

Method: The DINOv3-H+ vision transformer, pretrained on natural images, is fine-tuned for AMF classification using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and extensive augmentation. The efficiency of these methods is tested on the multi-domain MIDOG 2025 benchmark.

Result: The DINOv3-H+ vision transformer achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on a preliminary test set, demonstrating effective transferability to histopathology tasks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that DINOv3-H+, when paired with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) and enhanced augmentation, provides a reliable baseline for challenging AMF classification tasks in the MIDOG 2025 competition.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division
associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to
low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG
2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple
domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision
transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation.
Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology,
achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These
results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when
combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline
for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.

*Zehao Lu,Thijs L van der Plas,Parinaz Rashidi,W Daniel Kissling,Ioannis N Athanasiadis*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper presents a metadata extraction tool powered by large language models for ecological research datasets, simplifying integration and enabling advanced querying and ontology creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face challenges in combining and integrating ecological datasets due to diverse platforms and inconsistent metadata standards.

Method: The study developed an LLM-based metadata harvester capable of extracting structured and unstructured metadata, transforming it into a unified format using existing standards, and identifying dataset links via embedding similarity.

Result: The tool accurately extracts metadata, identifies relationships between datasets, and converts metadata into formats suitable for rule-based or graph-based queries.

Conclusion: The LLM-based tool enhances metadata management and facilitates efficient dataset search and integration in ecological research environments.

Abstract: Large, open datasets can accelerate ecological research, particularly by
enabling researchers to develop new insights by reusing datasets from multiple
sources. However, to find the most suitable datasets to combine and integrate,
researchers must navigate diverse ecological and environmental data provider
platforms with varying metadata availability and standards. To overcome this
obstacle, we have developed a large language model (LLM)-based metadata
harvester that flexibly extracts metadata from any dataset's landing page, and
converts these to a user-defined, unified format using existing metadata
standards. We validate that our tool is able to extract both structured and
unstructured metadata with equal accuracy, aided by our LLM post-processing
protocol. Furthermore, we utilise LLMs to identify links between datasets, both
by calculating embedding similarity and by unifying the formats of extracted
metadata to enable rule-based processing. Our tool, which flexibly links the
metadata of different datasets, can therefore be used for ontology creation or
graph-based queries, for example, to find relevant ecological and environmental
datasets in a virtual research environment.

*Tanay Aggarwal,Angelo Salatino,Francesco Osborne,Enrico Motta*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify semantic relationships among research topics in biomedicine, physics, and engineering. The study examines zero-shot, chain-of-thought prompting, and fine-tuning methods, concluding that fine-tuning on a novel dataset (PEM-Rel-8K) significantly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of creating and maintaining research ontologies, which are costly, time-intensive, and tend to have uneven coverage, limited inter-domain connectivity, and infrequent updates.

Method: The paper evaluates LLMs under three settings: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and fine-tuning on a novel dataset called PEM-Rel-8K, which contains over 8,000 semantic relationships extracted from widely used taxonomies like MeSH, PhySH, and IEEE.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs on the PEM-Rel-8K dataset showed excellent performance for identifying semantic relationships across the domains of biomedicine, physics, and engineering.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs can be highly effective in improving the creation and maintenance of research ontologies, potentially addressing the challenges of uneven coverage, lack of inter-domain connectivity, and updating issues.

Abstract: Ontologies and taxonomies of research fields are critical for managing and
organising scientific knowledge, as they facilitate efficient classification,
dissemination and retrieval of information. However, the creation and
maintenance of such ontologies are expensive and time-consuming tasks, usually
requiring the coordinated effort of multiple domain experts. Consequently,
ontologies in this space often exhibit uneven coverage across different
disciplines, limited inter-domain connectivity, and infrequent updating cycles.
In this study, we investigate the capability of several large language models
to identify semantic relationships among research topics within three academic
domains: biomedicine, physics, and engineering. The models were evaluated under
three distinct conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and
fine-tuning on existing ontologies. Additionally, we assessed the cross-domain
transferability of fine-tuned models by measuring their performance when
trained in one domain and subsequently applied to a different one. To support
this analysis, we introduce PEM-Rel-8K, a novel dataset consisting of over
8,000 relationships extracted from the most widely adopted taxonomies in the
three disciplines considered in this study: MeSH, PhySH, and IEEE. Our
experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K yields excellent
performance across all disciplines.

*Kang-Hyun Lee,Faez Ahmed*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper introduces MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework for generating 3D microstructures from 2D data, focusing on overcoming dataset limitations for materials engineering applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of diverse 3D microstructure datasets limits the ability to reliably establish structure-property linkages and solve inverse design problems.

Method: MicroLad uses latent diffusion with multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling, paired with score distillation sampling (SDS) for controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation aligned with material properties.

Result: MicroLad can generate stable and coherent 3D microstructures statistically consistent with 2D data, while enabling expanded exploration of 3D design spaces.

Conclusion: MicroLad bridges the gap between limited 2D datasets and the requirement for diverse 3D microstructures, advancing both analysis and inverse design in materials engineering.

Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in
materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets.
Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and
design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies,
hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design
problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion
framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D
data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion
sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and
coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original
data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion
(2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data,
effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the
generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad
integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable
score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment
terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent
space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation.
Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D
microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural
descriptors and material properties.

Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI technologies like 'AlphaEvolve' and 'Gemini Deep Think' highlights the potential to transform mathematical research practices.

Method: The authors analyze recent benchmarks, suggest a framework centered on augmented mathematicians, propose principles for effective AI integration, and explore applications across the research lifecycle.

Result: Findings show AI's prowess in solving problems yet underline systematic flaws such as lack of self-critique. The paper establishes guiding principles and practical applications for AI integration.

Conclusion: AI's current value lies in augmentation, necessitating researchers to adopt skills in strategic prompting, critical verification, and rigorous methodological use.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), marked by
breakthroughs like 'AlphaEvolve' and 'Gemini Deep Think', is beginning to offer
powerful new tools that have the potential to significantly alter the research
practice in many areas of mathematics. This paper explores the current
landscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical
research context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of
recent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\'c et
al., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while
state-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and
evaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of
self-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy
and full-proof validity.
  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI
into the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented
mathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical
guidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding
principles for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore
seven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from
creativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these
principles translate into concrete practice.
  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than
automation. This requires a new skill set focused on strategic prompting,
critical verification, and methodological rigor in order to effectively use
these powerful tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore LLMs' ability to tackle a real-world domain like U.S. tax law, which is complex and presents challenges even for human experts, potentially reducing tax revenue lost to tax avoidance.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs on tasks such as interpreting tax strategies, filling gaps in incomplete ones, and generating complete strategies, using the dynamic and complex corpus of U.S. tax law.

Result: An LLM successfully identified a novel tax strategy, showcasing the potential of these models to contribute to addressing tax abuse.

Conclusion: LLMs can be leveraged for advanced reasoning in complex domains like tax law, potentially aiding tax agencies in combating tax avoidance.

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models can discover and analyze U.S.
tax-minimization strategies. This real-world domain challenges even seasoned
human experts, and progress can reduce tax revenue lost from well-advised,
wealthy taxpayers. We evaluate the most advanced LLMs on their ability to (1)
interpret and verify tax strategies, (2) fill in gaps in partially specified
strategies, and (3) generate complete, end-to-end strategies from scratch. This
domain should be of particular interest to the LLM reasoning community: unlike
synthetic challenge problems or scientific reasoning tasks, U.S. tax law
involves navigating hundreds of thousands of pages of statutes, case law, and
administrative guidance, all updated regularly. Notably, LLM-based reasoning
identified an entirely novel tax strategy, highlighting these models' potential
to revolutionize tax agencies' fight against tax abuse.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mechanism by which the human brain achieves complex functional computations without significantly increasing energy consumption by subtly modifying the network of interactions between brain regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the human brain performs a wide range of functional computations without considerable changes in its energy consumption.

Method: Analyzed spontaneous and task-induced cerebral cortex activity data to examine probability fluxes, followed by modeling brain interactions using asymmetric Ising spin systems.

Result: Findings show that task performance induces changes in microscopic probability flux patterns and that symmetric brain region interactions are strong and invariant, while antisymmetric interactions are subtle and task-dependent.

Conclusion: Functional computations in the human brain are achieved through small modifications in antisymmetric interactions, requiring minimal energy changes.

Abstract: The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective
behaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the
recording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks
is expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data.
Thermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by
the brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high
energy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy
consumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not
involved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide
repertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy
consumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by
subtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We
first show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced
whole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the
microscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns
depending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function
is a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the
parameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal
that the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and
task-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and
task-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed
probability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs
its functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction
among the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generating long-context videos by proposing a sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), to efficiently retrieve key memory content over extended periods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling long-context video generation faces challenges due to the quadratic cost of self-attention, making memory and computation intractable for lengthy sequences.

Method: The authors introduce Mixture of Contexts (MoC), a learnable sparse attention routing module. MoC enables dynamic retrieval of informative chunks and mandatory anchors, while using causal routing to prevent loop closures.

Result: The proposed MoC module allows the model to allocate compute resources to critical memory chunks, achieving near-linear scaling in computation, enabling training, long-term consistency, and synthesis over minutes of video content.

Conclusion: MoC effectively scales video generation models to maintain efficiency and memory consistency over long durations, making it suitable for practical long-context video generation tasks.

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

### [321] [Validating Generative Agent-Based Models for Logistics and Supply Chain Management Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20234)
*Vincent E. Castillo*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This study examines the validity of Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) powered by large language models (LLMs) in simulating human behaviors in logistics settings through a controlled food delivery experiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to assess whether LLMs can mimic complex human behaviors accurately in logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) contexts using generative agent-based models.

Method: A controlled experiment involving food delivery dyads was conducted, using six state-of-the-art LLMs tested against 957 human participants through human equivalence and decision process validation frameworks.

Result: The study found that while GABMs demonstrate surface-level similarity to human behavior, discrepancies in decision-making processes between humans and LLMs were observed. This paradox necessitates dual-validation strategies.

Conclusion: GABMs can be a useful research tool in LSCM, provided they undergo rigorous validation for human equivalence and decision-making process fidelity. The findings also assist practitioners in selecting suitable LLMs for operational use.

Abstract: Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) powered by large language models (LLMs)
offer promising potential for empirical logistics and supply chain management
(LSCM) research by enabling realistic simulation of complex human behaviors.
Unlike traditional agent-based models, GABMs generate human-like responses
through natural language reasoning, which creates potential for new
perspectives on emergent LSCM phenomena. However, the validity of LLMs as
proxies for human behavior in LSCM simulations is unknown. This study evaluates
LLM equivalence of human behavior through a controlled experiment examining
dyadic customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. I test six
state-of-the-art LLMs against 957 human participants (477 dyads) using a
moderated mediation design. This study reveals a need to validate GABMs on two
levels: (1) human equivalence testing, and (2) decision process validation.
Results reveal GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM; however,
an equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges. While a series of Two One-Sided
Tests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level
equivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial
decision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These
findings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM
with proper validation checks. The dual-validation framework also provides LSCM
researchers with a guide to rigorous GABM development. For practitioners, this
study offers evidence-based assessment for LLM selection for operational tasks.

### [322] [A Hierarchical Signal Coordination and Control System Using a Hybrid Model-based and Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20102)
*Xianyue Peng,Shenyang Chen,H. Michael Zhang*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper presents a hierarchical traffic signal control system using model-based optimization and reinforcement learning to effectively manage urban arterial and intersection traffic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban traffic signal control must balance arterial traffic progression with adapting to localized demand variations.

Method: The proposed approach consists of a hierarchical system with a High-Level Coordinator (HLC), a Corridor Coordinator, and Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs), leveraging reinforcement learning (RLLib) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

Result: Simulations showed that Max-Flow Coordination maximizes throughput in high demand, Green-Wave Coordination reduces arterial stops but may lower network efficiency, and pure agent control improves travel time in moderate demand.

Conclusion: The hierarchical system adapts effectively to diverse traffic conditions, providing robust performance across demand levels through adaptive strategy selection.

Abstract: Signal control in urban corridors faces the dual challenge of maintaining
arterial traffic progression while adapting to demand variations at local
intersections. We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and
control scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement
learning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that
selects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a
Corridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected
strategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC);
and (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via
reinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical
reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train
HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware,
GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their
respective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to
dynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing
corridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed
and evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC
maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes
arterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but
can reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time
in moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand. The hierarchical
design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across
all demand levels.

*Francesco Prignoli,Francesco Borrelli,Paolo Falcone,Mark Pustilnik*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a motion planning framework called Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Planner (RA-GTP) for autonomous racing, ensuring compliance with racing rules and achieving safe yet competitive overtaking strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of integrating racing regulations, such as collision avoidance and right-of-way rules, into the motion planning of autonomous racing vehicles, ensuring both safety and competitive performance.

Method: The approach formalizes vehicle interactions as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) and uses an Iterative Best Response scheme. It integrates a regulation-aware game-theoretic decision-making layer for planning overtaking maneuvers.

Result: Experimental simulations show that RA-GTP surpasses baseline methods by generating effective, regulation-compliant overtaking strategies while outperforming approaches that do not consider racing rules or inter-vehicle interactions.

Conclusion: RA-GTP provides a significant advancement in autonomous racing by balancing safety and competitiveness through regulation-aware planning and game-theoretic reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents a regulation-aware motion planning framework for
autonomous racing scenarios. Each agent solves a Regulation-Compliant Model
Predictive Control problem, where racing rules - such as right-of-way and
collision avoidance responsibilities - are encoded using Mixed Logical
Dynamical constraints. We formalize the interaction between vehicles as a
Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) and approximate its solution using
an Iterative Best Response scheme. Building on this, we introduce the
Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Planner (RA-GTP), in which the attacker reasons
over the defender's regulation-constrained behavior. This game-theoretic layer
enables the generation of overtaking strategies that are both safe and
non-conservative. Simulation results demonstrate that the RA-GTP outperforms
baseline methods that assume non-interacting or rule-agnostic opponent models,
leading to more effective maneuvers while consistently maintaining compliance
with racing regulations.

*Zhuoyuan Wang,Raffaele Romagnoli,Kamyar Azizzadenesheli,Yorie Nakahira*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using physics-informed neural operators (PINO), specifically Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), to accurately quantify long-term risk probabilities in complex systems, improving training efficiency and enforcement of boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for quantifying long-term risk probabilities struggle to handle complex stochastic systems with varying dynamics or functional system changes effectively.

Method: The study introduces NeSO, a PINO framework that employs B-spline representations to map varying functional system dynamics to risk probabilities. It provides a theoretical universal approximation capability and applies this approach to case studies.

Result: NeSO demonstrates significant online speed-up and efficacy in handling cases with varying functional and high-dimensional multi-agent dynamics compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The NeSO framework enhances risk quantification efficiency and accuracy and has the potential to address broader control or PDE-related challenges apart from risk quantification.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying long-term risk probabilities in diverse stochastic
systems is essential for safety-critical control. However, existing
sampling-based and partial differential equation (PDE)-based methods often
struggle to handle complex varying dynamics. Physics-informed neural networks
learn surrogate mappings for risk probabilities from varying system parameters
of fixed and finite dimensions, yet can not account for functional variations
in system dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce physics-informed
neural operator (PINO) methods to risk quantification problems, to learn
mappings from varying \textit{functional} system dynamics to corresponding risk
probabilities. Specifically, we propose Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), a PINO
framework that leverages B-spline representations to improve training
efficiency and achieve better initial and boundary condition enforcements,
which are crucial for accurate risk quantification. We provide theoretical
analysis demonstrating the universal approximation capability of NeSO. We also
present two case studies, one with varying functional dynamics and another with
high-dimensional multi-agent dynamics, to demonstrate the efficacy of NeSO and
its significant online speed-up over existing methods. The proposed framework
and the accompanying universal approximation theorem are expected to be
beneficial for other control or PDE-related problems beyond risk
quantification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of handling unknown and arbitrarily long actuator delays in nonlinear systems where predictors are analytically intractable.

Method: Approximate the predictor using a learned neural operator mapping, trained offline and deployed online for fast computation; stability and convergence proved via theoretical analysis.

Result: Achieved semi-global practical convergence with speedups of 15 times compared to traditional numerical methods, validated on a biological system.

Conclusion: The neural operator method effectively balances accurate stability guarantees and computational efficiency, proving its practicality for complex nonlinear systems.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a rigorous method for implementing predictor
feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long
actuator delays. To address the analytically intractable nature of the
predictor, we approximate it using a learned neural operator mapping. This
mapping is trained once, offline, and then deployed online, leveraging the fast
inference capabilities of neural networks. We provide a theoretical stability
analysis based on the universal approximation theorem of neural operators and
the transport partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the delay.
We then prove, via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, semi-global practical
convergence of the dynamical system dependent on the approximation error of the
predictor and delay bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using
a biological activator/repressor system, demonstrating speedups of 15 times
compared to traditional numerical methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a photonic restricted Boltzmann machine (PRBM) that uses photonics to accelerate Gibbs sampling, enabling scalable, efficient content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the computational bottlenecks of Gibbs sampling in electronic implementations of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which hinder efficient content generation.

Method: The authors propose a PRBM using photonic computing to reduce Gibbs sampling complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$. They introduce an encoding method to avoid matrix decomposition and validate it with a simulated two-dimensional Ising model.

Result: The PRBM is experimentally shown to match theoretical phase transition predictions and demonstrates efficacy in generating and restoring images and temporal sequences under noise and aberrations.

Conclusion: The PRBM offers scalable and efficient solutions for generative AI tasks while showcasing the potential of photonic computing in overcoming traditional electronic limitations.

Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising
model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and
stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of
Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on
electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann
machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling,
enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding
method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix
decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from
$O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture
circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial
advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the
photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising
model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the
theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates
robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including
images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations.
The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its
potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative
artificial intelligence.

Motivation: CMS relies on Particle-Flow (PF) algorithms for event reconstruction, but the growing need for performance optimization and integration with newer computing architectures has led to exploring end-to-end machine learning approaches.

Method: The study employs a transformer-based machine learning model (MLPF) that combines tracks and clusters to infer physical particles in a single computational pass.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM-HSD, a multi-modal hate speech detection model for videos that incorporates video frames, audio, speech transcripts, and on-screen text using Cross-Modal Attention (CMA) for feature extraction, achieving superior performance on the HateMM dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech detection (HSD) in videos is limited due to inadequate exploration of inter-modal dependencies and the omission of important modalities like on-screen text and audio, which can carry subtle hateful cues.

Method: The MM-HSD model integrates video frames, audio, speech transcripts, and on-screen text using Cross-Modal Attention (CMA) as an early feature extractor to enhance inter-modal dependencies.

Result: MM-HSD achieves a state-of-the-art M-F1 score of 0.874 on the HateMM dataset by effectively utilizing all modalities and systematically optimizing CMA configurations.

Conclusion: The use of CMA in MM-HSD significantly enhances hate speech detection in videos by leveraging subtle cues from multiple modalities, setting a new performance benchmark.

Abstract: While hate speech detection (HSD) has been extensively studied in text,
existing multi-modal approaches remain limited, particularly in videos. As
modalities are not always individually informative, simple fusion methods fail
to fully capture inter-modal dependencies. Moreover, previous work often omits
relevant modalities such as on-screen text and audio, which may contain subtle
hateful content and thus provide essential cues, both individually and in
combination with others. In this paper, we present MM-HSD, a multi-modal model
for HSD in videos that integrates video frames, audio, and text derived from
speech transcripts and from frames (i.e.~on-screen text) together with features
extracted by Cross-Modal Attention (CMA). We are the first to use CMA as an
early feature extractor for HSD in videos, to systematically compare query/key
configurations, and to evaluate the interactions between different modalities
in the CMA block. Our approach leads to improved performance when on-screen
text is used as a query and the rest of the modalities serve as a key.
Experiments on the HateMM dataset show that MM-HSD outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on M-F1 score (0.874), using concatenation of transcript, audio, video,
on-screen text, and CMA for feature extraction on raw embeddings of the
modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/idiap/mm-hsd

TL;DR: This paper presents a quantum federated learning framework that leverages quantum noise to achieve differential privacy, ensuring secure model training and communication in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum federated learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit shared updates, posing a risk to information privacy.

Method: The proposed mechanism utilizes inherent quantum noise, such as measurement shot variance and depolarizing channel strength, to tailor differential privacy levels to constraints of noisy quantum devices.

Result: Simulations show the framework's ability to balance security and training accuracy while demonstrating robustness against adversarial attacks measured by metrics like attack success rates and prediction confidence.

Conclusion: This approach provides a tunable trade-off between privacy and robustness, offering an efficient solution for secure quantum federated learning in noisy quantum environments.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) enables collaborative training of quantum
machine learning (QML) models across distributed quantum devices without raw
data exchange. However, QFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where
shared QML model updates can be exploited to undermine information privacy. In
the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, a key question
arises: How can inherent quantum noise be leveraged to enforce differential
privacy (DP) and protect model information during training and communication?
This paper explores a novel DP mechanism that harnesses quantum noise to
safeguard quantum models throughout the QFL process. By tuning noise variance
through measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, our approach
achieves desired DP levels tailored to NISQ constraints. Simulations
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by examining the relationship between
differential privacy budget and noise parameters, as well as the trade-off
between security and training accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate the
framework's robustness against an adversarial attack designed to compromise
model performance using adversarial examples, with evaluations based on
critical metrics such as accuracy on adversarial examples, confidence scores
for correct predictions, and attack success rates. The results reveal a tunable
trade-off between privacy and robustness, providing an efficient solution for
secure QFL on NISQ devices with significant potential for reliable quantum
computing applications.

Motivation: With longer and more complex multi-turn dialogues in LLMs, users face challenges in evaluating and managing their conversational goals, necessitating tools for better dialogue navigation.

Method: The authors developed 'OnGoal,' a chat interface incorporating real-time LLM-assisted evaluation, explanation of alignment results, and overviews of goal progression, and tested it through a study involving participants conducting writing tasks.

Result: Participants using OnGoal spent less time and effort to achieve their goals, explored more prompting strategies, and handled miscommunication better compared to a baseline interface without goal tracking.

Conclusion: Integrating goal tracking and visualization in LLM chat interfaces can reduce cognitive load, enhance engagement, increase interactivity, and improve overall user experience in complex dialogues.

Abstract: As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and
more complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their

better manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal
alignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results
with examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to
navigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20
participants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat
interface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and
effort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to
overcome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can
enhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired

TL;DR: ELIXIR combines rating prediction with personalized review generation to overcome challenges in explainability and user-item interaction in collaborative filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommender systems struggle with generating fine-grained, explainable recommendations that align with user preferences.

Method: ELIXIR uses a multi-task T5-small-based architecture for rating prediction and personalized review generation, incorporating global and aspect-specific user/item representations.

Result: Experimental evaluations on TripAdvisor and RateBeer show ELIXIR outperforms baseline models, particularly in personalized review generation.

Conclusion: ELIXIR effectively addresses shortcomings in explainability and aspect modeling within recommender systems, setting a new standard in leveraging lightweight pre-trained Transformers.

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose
ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a
multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review
generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of
users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review
generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based
on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based
architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where
state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer
demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models,
especially in review generation.

### [335] [MPFormer: Adaptive Framework for Industrial Multi-Task Personalized Sequential Retriever](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20400)
*Yijia Sun,Shanshan Huang,Linxiao Che,Haitao Lu,Qiang Luo,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, as a solution to mismatch challenges in multi-stage industrial recommendation systems. It improves user engagement and operational efficiency at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommendation systems have a misalignment issue between multi-objective optimization and single-objective modeling, leading to resource inefficiency and poor handling of loosely coupled objectives.

Method: The proposed MPFormer integrates mechanisms like objective-conditioned Transformer encoding, dynamic adjustment through personalized target weights, and enriching representations with user customization.

Result: MPFormer has been deployed in the Kuaishou recommendation system, serving 400 million users daily, and has shown notable improvements in user engagement and operational efficacy.

Conclusion: MPFormer resolves major limitations in current recommendation systems, offering a scalable and efficient solution for multi-objective optimization while maintaining service speed.

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of
multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists
between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking
phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the
mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel
multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of
training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent
limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the
MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically
addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First,
an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior
sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation;
second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic
adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is
incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to
further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been
successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably
serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user
daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment
verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively
optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining
service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for
industrial recommendation systems.

### [336] [Rethinking Purity and Diversity in Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation from the Frequency Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20427)
*Yongqiang Han,Kai Cheng,Kefan Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enhancing multi-behavior sequential recommendation systems by utilizing both low-frequency and high-frequency information for better user interest modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the problem of noise in multi-behavior recommendation systems and challenges the traditional notion that high-frequency information is always noise.

Method: The authors propose a model called PDB4Rec, which extracts information across various frequency bands and employs a Bootstrapping Balancer mechanism to balance contributions from these frequencies.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates superior effectiveness and efficiency in experiments conducted on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Both low-frequency and high-frequency information are significant, corresponding to purity and diversity of user interests, respectively, and leveraging both improves recommendation system performance.

Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as
browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation
(MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to
improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some
behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user
interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency
domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These
studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and
reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In
this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means
insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency
corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds
to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our
model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency
bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism
to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance.
Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our model.

### [337] [On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21038)
*Orion Weller,Michael Boratko,Iftekhar Naim,Jinhyuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper explores the inherent limitations of vector embeddings in retrieval tasks, demonstrating their constraints even in simple queries. A new dataset, LIMIT, showcases these shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the assumption that theoretical limitations of vector embeddings can be overcome with better training data and larger models, examining if these limitations persist in realistic queries.

Method: By connecting known learning theory results, testing dimensions of embeddings, and creating the LIMIT dataset as a stress test for models, the study evaluates embedding performance limitations.

Result: Empirical analysis shows that even state-of-the-art models fail on the LIMIT dataset, revealing the fundamental constraints of current embedding methodologies.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the inherent limits of the single vector embedding paradigm and encourage future research to overcome these theoretical and practical challenges.

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

*Alexandre Andre,Gauthier Roy,Eva Dyer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates fairness in zero-context LLM-based recommendations, uncovering biases and analyzing their relationship with model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses fairness concerns of LLMs in cold-start recommendation scenarios where minimal user data is provided.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark and modular pipeline to systematically assess fairness across configurable domains and attributes.

Result: They found consistent societal biases in models like Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2 across various recommendation domains.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit fairness challenges, and a nuanced approach is essential to understand and mitigate biases in recommendations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks
due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in
rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only
limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness
concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining.
We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in
zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable
recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and
flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art
models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across
recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and
cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model
size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.

### [339] [SemSR: Semantics aware robust Session-based Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20587)
*Jyoti Narwariya,Priyanka Gupta,Muskan Gupta,Jyotsana Khatri,Lovekesh Vig*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper leverages large language models (LLMs) to improve session-based recommendation systems by proposing hybrid methods combining LLMs with data-driven models, achieving superior performance in Recall and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing session-based recommendation systems fail to capture semantic information from item texts and lack efficient utilization of LLMs due to challenges with prompt optimization and high computational costs in fine-tuning.

Method: The paper explores three strategies: using LLM prompting as recommendation agents, employing LLMs for initializing semantic representations in traditional models, and integrating LLMs with data-driven models for improved session recommendations.

Result: Experiments show LLM-based methods are better at coarse-level retrieval, while data-driven techniques excel at fine-grained ranking. Integrated approaches outperform both standalone LLM methods and traditional models based on Recall and MRR metrics.

Conclusion: The integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models provides an effective solution, overcoming limitations of LLM-only approaches and significantly improving recommendation performance.

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SR) models aim to recommend items to anonymous
users based on their behavior during the current session. While various SR
models in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they
often fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions
impeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research
has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance
session-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based
methods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to
identify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific
feedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning
methods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant
computational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we
present multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:
(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated
representations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and
(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models. Through comprehensive
experiments on two real-world publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that
LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall values), while
traditional data-driven techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking (high
Mean Reciprocal Rank values). Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with
data-driven SR models significantly out performs both standalone LLM approaches
and data-driven deep learning models, as well as baseline SR models, in terms
of both Recall and MRR metrics.

*Xinhao Huang,Zhibo Ren,Yipeng Yu,Ying Zhou,Zulong Chen,Zeyi Wen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for long structured document retrieval called \our, addressing limitations in existing methods with structure-aware learning and masked element alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore structural features and lack datasets with explicit structural metadata, limiting their effectiveness for document retrieval.

Method: The proposed method incorporates structure-aware learning to preserve semantic hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic recognition.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements, increasing NDCG@10 from 73.96% to 77.84% using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves performance in long structured document retrieval, enabling better use of structural information. A corresponding dataset, \dataset, is also publicly released for broader research use.

Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune
pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets
lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two
critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and
element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing
structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive
learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic
hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic
discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document
retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on
both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with
online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting
NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3. The resources are available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable approach to improve multi-domain autoregressive recommendation models by reducing the computational overhead of attention maps using innovative mechanisms like domain-specific positional embeddings and dynamic domain state representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive recommendation models exhibit promising scaling laws but face computational bottlenecks when applied to multi-domain scenarios due to attention maps covering every domain.

Method: The authors propose Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE) for domain-specific attention and Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR) to store efficient domain-specific states, reducing computational costs.

Result: The approach improves retrieval tasks by effectively balancing inter- and intra-domain knowledge transfer and eliminating unnecessary computations.

Conclusion: The novel mechanisms introduced provide a scalable and efficient solution for large-scale multi-domain recommendation systems, enabling better scalability and retrieval performance.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive recommendation models (ARMs), such as Meta's HSTU
model, have emerged as a major breakthrough over traditional Deep Learning
Recommendation Models (DLRMs), exhibiting the highly sought-after scaling law
behaviour. However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer
architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend
to all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must
efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by
replacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)
Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional
embeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows
attention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the
unnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.
2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state
representation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent
token predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain
information without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a
scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain
recommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval
tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain
representations.

*Minghao Hu,Junzhe Wang,Weisen Zhao,Qiang Zeng,Lannan Luo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a technique for cross-ISA malware detection using Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) to reduce data collection efforts for deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting malware across multiple Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) without needing extensive labeled datasets for every ISA, driven by the increasing threat of cyberattacks targeting IoT devices.

Method: The method involves translating malware from one ISA to another ISA (e.g., X86-64) with sufficient labeled samples using NMT and NFs, allowing a single ISA-trained model to detect malware in other ISAs.

Result: The approach enables efficient malware detection across multiple ISAs using a model trained on just one ISA, reducing laborious data collection efforts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a promising way to leverage translation-based techniques for cross-ISA malware detection, improving efficiency and resource utilization in real-world cybersecurity applications.

Abstract: Applying deep learning to malware detection has drawn great attention due to
its notable performance. With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks
targeting IoT devices, there is a parallel rise in the development of malware
across various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). It is thus important to
extend malware detection capacity to multiple ISAs. However, training a deep
learning-based malware detection model usually requires a large number of
labeled malware samples. The process of collecting and labeling sufficient
malware samples to build datasets for each ISA is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce the burden of data collection, we propose to leverage
the ideas of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) for
malware detection. Specifically, when dealing with malware in a certain ISA, we
translate it to an ISA with sufficient malware samples (like X86-64). This
allows us to apply a model trained on one ISA to analyze malware from another
ISA. Our approach reduces the data collection effort by enabling malware
detection across multiple ISAs using a model trained on a single ISA.

TL;DR: An analysis of Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) containers reveals critical security flaws and proposes lessons for improved design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for secure middleware solutions in TEE platforms to protect applications from malicious operating systems and interfaces.

Method: An automated analyzer was designed to evaluate the isolation strategies and security boundaries of existing TEE containers.

Result: Significant security risks were identified in some containers due to flaws like information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks.

Conclusion: Lessons and trends were presented to guide more secure TEE container solutions improving confidential computing frameworks.

Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a cornerstone of
confidential computing, garnering significant attention from both academia and
industry. To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of
applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as
middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from
potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while
maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation
strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications.
To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an
automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation
boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended
goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information
leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to
guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging
trends in TEE containerization design.

TL;DR: This paper explores how small language models can create automated, persona-aligned political messaging and its detection challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the capability and behaviors of AI-powered influence operations using small language models.

Method: Analysis of language models to generate persona-driven messages and evaluate their automatic detection capabilities.

Result: Persona design influenced behavior more than model type; engagement with replies led to stronger ideological adherence and extreme content.

Conclusion: AI-powered automated influence operations are feasible, but their consistency can also aid in detection through conversation-centric methods.

Abstract: AI-powered influence operations can now be executed end-to-end on commodity
hardware. We show that small language models produce coherent, persona-driven
political messaging and can be evaluated automatically without human raters.
Two behavioural findings emerge. First, persona-over-model: persona design
explains behaviour more than model identity. Second, engagement as a stressor:
when replies must counter-arguments, ideological adherence strengthens and the
prevalence of extreme content increases. We demonstrate that fully automated
influence-content production is within reach of both large and small actors.
Consequently, defence should shift from restricting model access towards
conversation-centric detection and disruption of campaigns and coordination
infrastructure. Paradoxically, the very consistency that enables these
operations also provides a detection signature.

TL;DR: The study exposes vulnerabilities in Web and Research Agents (WRAs) to inference attacks based on network metadata like IP traces and timings, revealing sensitive user prompt and trait information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and highlight the privacy risks posed by WRAs for users and organizations relying on them for tasks requiring privacy and security.

Method: The researchers created a dataset of WRA traces (from real users and synthetic personas), introduced the OBELS metric for similarity analysis, and evaluated fingerprinting attacks under various conditions.

Result: The attacks recover over 73% of functional and domain knowledge from prompts and up to 19 of 32 latent user traits with high accuracy, even under noisy and partial data scenarios.

Conclusion: WRAs demonstrate significant privacy vulnerabilities; mitigation strategies like domain constraint and trace obfuscation can reduce attack success without substantially impacting utility.

Abstract: We show that Web and Research Agents (WRAs) -- language model-based systems
that investigate complex topics on the Internet -- are vulnerable to inference
attacks by passive network adversaries such as ISPs. These agents could be
deployed \emph{locally} by organizations and individuals for privacy, legal, or
financial purposes. Unlike sporadic web browsing by humans, WRAs visit
$70{-}140$ domains with distinguishable timing correlations, enabling unique
fingerprinting attacks.
  Specifically, we demonstrate a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack
against WRAs that only leverages their network-level metadata (i.e., visited IP
addresses and their timings). We start by building a new dataset of WRA traces
based on user search queries and queries generated by synthetic personas. We
define a behavioral metric (called OBELS) to comprehensively assess similarity
between original and inferred prompts, showing that our attack recovers over
73\% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts. Extending to a
multi-session setting, we recover up to 19 of 32 latent traits with high
accuracy. Our attack remains effective under partial observability and noisy
conditions. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies that constrain domain
diversity or obfuscate traces, showing negligible utility impact while reducing
attack effectiveness by an average of 29\%.

Abstract: The rise of AI has transformed the software and hardware landscape, enabling
powerful capabilities through specialized infrastructures, large-scale data

outputs with false positives, or degrading model accuracy. This paper serves to
raise awareness of the novel cyber threats that are introduced when
incorporating AI into a software system. We explore the operational
cybersecurity and supply chain risks across the AI lifecycle, emphasizing the
need for tailored security frameworks to address evolving threats in the

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper critiques Google's SynthID-Text for weak watermarking under semantic-preserving attacks and introduces SynGuard, a hybrid system combining semantic retrieval and probabilistic watermarking. SynGuard improves watermark robustness by 11.1% in F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is driven by the vulnerabilities in existing AI-text watermarking methods like SynthID-Text, which fail under semantic-preserving attacks like paraphrasing and back-translation.

Method: The paper proposes SynGuard, a hybrid framework that embeds watermarks at lexical and semantic levels using Semantic Information Retrieval (SIR) and probabilistic watermarking techniques.

Result: SynGuard improves watermark detectability by 11.1% in F1 score under various attack scenarios, showcasing its robustness compared to SynthID-Text.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of semantic-aware watermarking, demonstrating that SynGuard offers a resilient solution to trace the provenance of AI-generated text in tamper-prone environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM watermarking methods such as SynthID-Text by Google
DeepMind offer promising solutions for tracing the provenance of AI-generated
text. However, our robustness assessment reveals that SynthID-Text is
vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks, such as paraphrasing, copy-paste
modifications, and back-translation, which can significantly degrade watermark
detectability. To address these limitations, we propose SynGuard, a hybrid
framework that combines the semantic alignment strength of Semantic Information
Retrieval (SIR) with the probabilistic watermarking mechanism of SynthID-Text.
Our approach jointly embeds watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels,
enabling robust provenance tracking while preserving the original meaning.
Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios show that SynGuard
improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1\% in F1 score compared to
SynthID-Text. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic-aware
watermarking in resisting real-world tampering. All code, datasets, and
evaluation scripts are publicly available at:

TL;DR: BridgeShield utilizes heterogeneous graph attention networks to detect attack behaviors in cross-chain bridges, achieving an average F1-score of 92.58%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-chain bridges are vulnerable to hacker attacks due to design flaws and high-value assets, highlighting the need for effective defense mechanisms.

Method: BridgeShield models cross-chain activity as a unified heterogeneous graph representation, using intra-meta-path and inter-meta-path attention for better feature extraction and semantic understanding.

Result: BridgeShield outperforms existing methods with a 92.58% average F1-score in detection tasks and exhibits a 24.39% improvement over current baselines.

Conclusion: BridgeShield offers a practical and effective solution for improving security in cross-chain ecosystems, showcasing its potential for real-world applications in protecting blockchain interoperability.

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges play a vital role in enabling blockchain
interoperability. However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous
value they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing
detection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address
single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address
this gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are
well-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the
complex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield,
a detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain
coordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph
representation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn
fine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path
attention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling
precise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51
real-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an
average F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over
state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of
BridgeShield as a practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and
enhancing the resilience of multi-chain ecosystems.

This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient
privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization.
These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical
domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated
Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a
new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented
medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of
the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT
or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction
networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity
while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like
tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by
allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.
We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging
pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI
systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align
heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this
paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a
valuable reference for the field's development.

### [350] [Multi-Agent Penetration Testing AI for the Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20816)
*Isaac David,Arthur Gervais*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MAPTA is proposed as a multi-agent system to solve scalability issues in security auditing of AI-generated code, showing substantial success in detecting vulnerabilities at low cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing accessibility of software development, enabled by AI-powered platforms, has led to a rise in security vulnerabilities. With studies finding up to 40% of AI-generated code containing such issues, traditional auditing methods struggle to cope with the required scalability.

Method: MAPTA employs a multi-agent system that integrates large language models with tool-grounded execution and end-to-end exploit validation to autonomously assess web application security across various challenges.

Result: On the XBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieved 76.9% overall success rate, excelling at SSRF, misconfiguration vulnerabilities, and injection attacks but showed weaker results on challenges like XSS and blind SQL injection. The system demonstrated strong resource efficiency with a low operational cost.

Conclusion: MAPTA proves effective in identifying critical vulnerabilities at a scalable and cost-efficient level. Its real-world application uncovered significant issues in popular GitHub repositories, with 10 findings currently under CVE review.

Abstract: AI-powered development platforms are making software creation accessible to a
broader audience, but this democratization has triggered a scalability crisis
in security auditing. With studies showing that up to 40% of AI-generated code
contains vulnerabilities, the pace of development now vastly outstrips the
capacity for thorough security assessment.
  We present MAPTA, a multi-agent system for autonomous web application
security assessment that combines large language model orchestration with
tool-grounded execution and end-to-end exploit validation. On the 104-challenge
XBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieves 76.9% overall success with perfect performance
on SSRF and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, 83% success on broken
authorization, and strong results on injection attacks including server-side
template injection (85%) and SQL injection (83%). Cross-site scripting (57%)
and blind SQL injection (0%) remain challenging. Our comprehensive cost
analysis across all challenges totals $21.38 with a median cost of $0.073 for
successful attempts versus $0.357 for failures. Success correlates strongly
with resource efficiency, enabling practical early-stopping thresholds at
approximately 40 tool calls or $0.30 per challenge.
  MAPTA's real-world findings are impactful given both the popularity of the
respective scanned GitHub repositories (8K-70K stars) and MAPTA's low average
operating cost of $3.67 per open-source assessment: MAPTA discovered critical
vulnerabilities including RCEs, command injections, secret exposure, and
arbitrary file write vulnerabilities. Findings are responsibly disclosed, 10
findings are under CVE review.

### [351] [JADES: A Universal Framework for Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20848)
*Junjie Chu,Mingjie Li,Ziqing Yang,Ye Leng,Chenhao Lin,Chao Shen,Michael Backes,Yun Shen,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces JADES, a framework to accurately evaluate whether large language model (LLM) jailbreak attempts succeed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing jailbreak attempts frequently fail due to inconsistent and subjective evaluations that misalign with human perception.

Method: The JADES framework decomposes harmful questions into sub-questions, scores each sub-answer, aggregates these scores, and optionally conducts fact-checking to detect hallucinations.

Result: Validated on a benchmark with 400 manually annotated samples, JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human evaluators, outperforming baselines by over 9%. It corrects substantial overestimation of attack success rates.

Conclusion: JADES provides a reliable, consistent, and interpretable mechanism for evaluating jailbreak attacks, enabling better measures for future attacks on LLMs.

Abstract: Accurately determining whether a jailbreak attempt has succeeded is a
fundamental yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods rely on
misaligned proxy indicators or naive holistic judgments. They frequently
misinterpret model responses, leading to inconsistent and subjective
assessments that misalign with human perception. To address this gap, we
introduce JADES (Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring), a universal
jailbreak evaluation framework. Its key mechanism is to automatically decompose
an input harmful question into a set of weighted sub-questions, score each
sub-answer, and weight-aggregate the sub-scores into a final decision. JADES
also incorporates an optional fact-checking module to strengthen the detection
of hallucinations in jailbreak responses. We validate JADES on JailbreakQR, a
newly introduced benchmark proposed in this work, consisting of 400 pairs of
jailbreak prompts and responses, each meticulously annotated by humans. In a
binary setting (success/failure), JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human
evaluators, outperforming strong baselines by over 9%. Re-evaluating five
popular attacks on four LLMs reveals substantial overestimation (e.g., LAA's
attack success rate on GPT-3.5-Turbo drops from 93% to 69%). Our results show
that JADES could deliver accurate, consistent, and interpretable evaluations,
providing a reliable basis for measuring future jailbreak attacks.

*Amine Lbath,Massih-Reza Amini,Aurelien Delaitre,Vadim Okun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes an AI-driven framework to generate datasets for training vulnerability detection systems by simulating realistic vulnerabilities in secure C/C++ codebases, achieving high success rates in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for effective automated systems to detect and repair software vulnerabilities, as traditional methods struggle with scalability and accuracy, and AI methods depend on high-quality datasets.

Method: The framework uses coordinated AI agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation for context grounding, and Low-Rank approximation for model fine-tuning to inject vulnerabilities into secure codebases.

Result: The framework achieved between 89% and 95% accuracy in injecting realistic vulnerabilities across 116 code samples from three benchmarks.

Conclusion: This approach provides a scalable and effective way to generate high-quality datasets for improving AI-driven vulnerability detection systems.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of
cyber-attacks have underscored the critical need for effective automated
vulnerability detection and repair systems. Traditional methods, such as static
program analysis, face significant challenges related to scalability,
adaptability, and high false-positive and false-negative rates. AI-driven
approaches, particularly those using machine learning and deep learning models,
show promise but are heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of training
data. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to automatically
introduce realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++
codebases to generate datasets. The proposed approach coordinates multiple AI
agents that simulate expert reasoning, along with function agents and
traditional code analysis tools. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
for contextual grounding and employs Low-Rank approximation of weights for
efficient model fine-tuning. Our experimental study on 116 code samples from
three different benchmarks suggests that our approach outperforms other
techniques with regard to dataset accuracy, achieving between 89\% and 95\%
success rates in injecting vulnerabilities at function level.

### [353] [Multi-Objective Optimization of ReRAM Crossbars for Robust DNN Inferencing under Stochastic Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05437)
*Xiaoxuan Yang,Syrine Belakaria,Biresh Kumar Joardar,Huanrui Yang,Janardhan Rao Doppa,Partha Pratim Pande,Krishnendu Chakrabarty,Hai Li*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: The paper develops ReSNA and CF-MESMO, two methods to optimize ReRAM-based DNN hardware accelerators to achieve robust inferencing despite stochastic noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReRAM crossbars have stochastic noise that hampers deep neural network inference accuracy, necessitating new strategies for robust performance.

Method: The paper introduces ReSNA (stochastic-noise-aware training) and CF-MESMO (information-theoretic trade-off optimization) to improve inference accuracy and computational cost efficiency.

Result: ReSNA improved ResNet20 inference accuracy by 2.57% on CIFAR-10, while CF-MESMO reduced computation cost by 90.91% compared to NSGA-II.

Conclusion: The proposed methods efficiently optimize ReRAM-based DNN hardware for accuracy, performance, and cost efficiency under stochastic noise.

Abstract: Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is a promising technology for
designing hardware accelerators for deep neural network (DNN) inferencing.
However, stochastic noise in ReRAM crossbars can degrade the DNN inferencing
accuracy. We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance,
area-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust
DNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical
contributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method,
referred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM
crossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic
algorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to
trade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead,
execution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is
that executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is
prohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity
evaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost
by varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost.
CF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that
maximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal
Pareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed
algorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts. On average, ReSNA
achieves 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10
dataset with respect to the baseline configuration. Moreover, CF-MESMO
algorithm achieves 90.91% reduction in computation cost compared to the popular
multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II to reach the best solution from
NSGA-II.

### [354] [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Asset Allocation Using DDPG with TiDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20103)
*Rongwei Liu,Jin Zheng,John Cartlidge*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for optimal asset allocation between risky and risk-free assets, introducing an advanced framework that outperforms traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of conventional asset allocation methods by creating a more adaptable, robust approach using reinforcement learning.

Method: Formulated asset allocation as a Markov Decision Process and utilized reinforcement learning mechanisms, specifically the DDPG framework integrated with TiDE.

Result: The proposed DDPG-TiDE framework achieved better risk-adjusted returns compared to Q-learning and a buy-and-hold strategy.

Conclusion: Integrating TiDE with DDPG in RL proves effective for dynamic asset allocation, setting a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: The optimal asset allocation between risky and risk-free assets is a
persistent challenge due to the inherent volatility in financial markets.
Conventional methods rely on strict distributional assumptions or non-additive
reward ratios, which limit their robustness and applicability to investment
goals. To overcome these constraints, this study formulates the optimal
two-asset allocation problem as a sequential decision-making task within a
Markov Decision Process (MDP). This framework enables the application of
reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms to develop dynamic policies based on
simulated financial scenarios, regardless of prerequisites. We use the Kelly
criterion to balance immediate reward signals against long-term investment
objectives, and we take the novel step of integrating the Time-series Dense
Encoder (TiDE) into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL framework
for continuous decision-making. We compare DDPG-TiDE with a simple
discrete-action Q-learning RL framework and a passive buy-and-hold investment
strategy. Empirical results show that DDPG-TiDE outperforms Q-learning and
generates higher risk adjusted returns than buy-and-hold. These findings
suggest that tackling the optimal asset allocation problem by integrating TiDE
within a DDPG reinforcement learning framework is a fruitful avenue for further
exploration.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: This paper introduces QTMRL, a reinforcement learning-based intelligent trading agent leveraging multi-dimensional technical indicators for effective portfolio management in volatile markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional trading models struggle with dynamic market changes and black swan events due to rigid assumptions.

Method: The paper uses a multi-indicator dataset based on S&P 500 data paired with a lightweight RL framework (A2C algorithm) for policy learning and trading decisions.

Result: Experiments show QTMRL outperforms 9 baselines in profitability, risk adjustment, and downside risk control in diverse market conditions.

Conclusion: QTMRL offers adaptive and stable trading strategies benefiting from reinforcement learning and multi-indicator analysis, addressing limitations of traditional models.

Abstract: In the highly volatile and uncertain global financial markets, traditional
quantitative trading models relying on statistical modeling or empirical rules
often fail to adapt to dynamic market changes and black swan events due to
rigid assumptions and limited generalization. To address these issues, this
paper proposes QTMRL (Quantitative Trading Multi-Indicator Reinforcement
Learning), an intelligent trading agent combining multi-dimensional technical
indicators with reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive and stable portfolio
management. We first construct a comprehensive multi-indicator dataset using 23
years of S&P 500 daily OHLCV data (2000-2022) for 16 representative stocks
across 5 sectors, enriching raw data with trend, volatility, and momentum
indicators to capture holistic market dynamics. Then we design a lightweight RL
framework based on the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm, including data
processing, A2C algorithm, and trading agent modules to support policy learning
and actionable trading decisions. Extensive experiments compare QTMRL with 9
baselines (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, moving average strategies) across diverse market
regimes, verifying its superiority in profitability, risk adjustment, and
downside risk control. The code of QTMRL is publicly available at

*Julio Zanon Diaz,Tommy Brennan,Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper assesses challenges and strategies for implementing DL-based visual inspections for Class III medical devices while navigating the EU AI Act and other regulatory frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how deep learning technologies can enhance quality assurance in Class III medical devices, while addressing regulatory challenges under the EU AI Act.

Method: The paper evaluates divergences and challenges in integrating DL-based systems within current compliance frameworks, including risk management, dataset governance, validation, and more.

Result: Identifies key challenges, such as data retention, global compliance, and validation with limited defect data, while exploring implementation strategies.

Conclusion: Manufacturers must carefully navigate regulatory landscapes and consult experts to ensure compliance; this paper serves as an academic evaluation, not regulatory advice.

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) technologies advance, their application in automated
visual inspection for Class III medical devices offers significant potential to
enhance quality assurance and reduce human error. However, the adoption of such
AI-based systems introduces new regulatory complexities--particularly under the
EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, which imposes high-risk system obligations
that differ in scope and depth from established regulatory frameworks such as
the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the U.S. FDA Quality System Regulation
(QSR). This paper presents a high-level technical assessment of the
foresee-able challenges that manufacturers are likely to encounter when
qualifying DL-based automated inspections within the existing medical device
compliance landscape. It examines divergences in risk management principles,
dataset governance, model validation, explainability requirements, and
post-deployment monitoring obligations. The discussion also explores potential
implementation strategies and highlights areas of uncertainty, including data
retention burdens, global compliance implications, and the practical
difficulties of achieving statistical significance in validation with limited
defect data. Disclaimer: This publication is in-tended solely as an academic

*Eugene Kim,Vaibhav Balloli,Berelian Karimian,Elizabeth Bondi-Kelly,Benjamin Fish*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Participatory AI faces challenges in stakeholder recruitment. This paper analyzes the methodologies used and offers recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying, reaching out, and engaging all relevant stakeholders required for designing impactful Participatory AI systems.

Method: Analyzed recruitment methodologies from 37 AI projects and conducted interviews with five AI researchers to understand recruitment challenges and strategies.

Result: Findings highlight that outcomes are influenced by work structure, researchers' expectations, and relationship-building during recruitment.

Conclusion: Recommendations provided for relationship-focused recruitment methods and better documentation practices in Participatory AI projects.

Abstract: Participatory AI, in which impacted community members and other stakeholders
are involved in the design and development of AI systems, holds promise as a
way to ensure AI is developed to meet their needs and reflect their values.
However, the process of identifying, reaching out, and engaging with all
relevant stakeholder groups, which we refer to as recruitment methodology, is
still a practical challenge in AI projects striving to adopt participatory
practices. In this paper, we investigate the challenges that researchers face
when designing and executing recruitment methodology for Participatory AI
projects, and the implications of current recruitment practice for
Participatory AI. First, we describe the recruitment methodologies used in AI
projects using a corpus of 37 projects to capture the diversity of practices in
the field and perform an initial analysis on the documentation of recruitment
practices, as well as specific strategies that researchers use to meet goals of
equity and empowerment. To complement this analysis, we interview five AI
researchers to learn about the outcomes of recruitment methodologies. We find
that these outcomes are shaped by structural conditions of their work,
researchers' own goals and expectations, and the relationships built from the
recruitment methodology and subsequent collaboration. Based on these analyses,
we provide recommendations for designing and executing relationship-forward
recruitment methods, as well as reflexive recruitment documentation practices
for Participatory AI researchers.

### [358] [Latent Factor Point Processes for Patient Representation in Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20327)
*Parker Knight,Doudou Zhou,Zongqi Xia,Tianxi Cai,Junwei Lu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The study introduces a latent factor point process model to represent temporal patterns in EHR data and proposes a novel embedding method for patient-level analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current statistical methods for EHR data neglect temporal structure in their analysis, and existing models involve restrictive assumptions or fail to address patient-level tasks effectively.

Method: The paper proposes a latent factor point process model with a low-rank structure driven by a latent Poisson process and introduces the Fourier-Eigen embedding to capture subgroup-specific temporal patterns.

Result: Simulations and application to Alzheimer's disease EHR data show the model's effectiveness in identifying clinically meaningful heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The latent factor point process model and Fourier-Eigen embedding improve the representation and analysis of EHR data, capturing complex temporal relationships effectively.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) contain valuable longitudinal patient-level
information, yet most statistical methods reduce the irregular timing of EHR
codes into simple counts, thereby discarding rich temporal structure. Existing
temporal models often impose restrictive parametric assumptions or are tailored
to code level rather than patient-level tasks. We propose the latent factor
point process model, which represents code occurrences as a high-dimensional
point process whose conditional intensity is driven by a low dimensional latent
Poisson process. This low-rank structure reflects the clinical reality that
thousands of codes are governed by a small number of underlying disease
processes, while enabling statistically efficient estimation in high
dimensions. Building on this model, we introduce the Fourier-Eigen embedding, a
patient representation constructed from the spectral density matrix of the
observed process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that these
embeddings efficiently capture subgroup-specific temporal patterns for
downstream classification and clustering. Simulations and an application to an
Alzheimer's disease EHR cohort demonstrate the practical advantages of our
approach in uncovering clinically meaningful heterogeneity.

*Nicholas H. Nelsen,Yunan Yang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper reviews the convergence of operator learning and inverse problems, focusing on end-to-end paradigms, noise handling, and measure-based formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the intersection of operator learning and inverse problems, and how emerging methodologies enhance solving inverse problems in computational sciences.

Method: Surveys probabilistic and deterministic approaches, emphasizes measure-centric formulations, discusses data generation and architecture, and explores end-to-end inverse operator learning paradigms.

Result: Highlights advancements in structure-aware architectures, noise handling strategies, and relevant theory while showcasing operator learning’s integration into classical inversion algorithms.

Conclusion: End-to-end operator learning offers a promising and efficient solution for data-driven inverse problems, particularly with suitable architectures and noise handling mechanisms.

Abstract: Operator learning offers a robust framework for approximating mappings
between infinite-dimensional function spaces. It has also become a powerful
tool for solving inverse problems in the computational sciences. This chapter
surveys methodological and theoretical developments at the intersection of
operator learning and inverse problems. It begins by summarizing the
probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems, and pays
special attention to emerging measure-centric formulations that treat observed
data or unknown parameters as probability distributions. The discussion then
turns to operator learning by covering essential components such as data
generation, loss functions, and widely used architectures for representing
function-to-function maps. The core of the chapter centers on the end-to-end
inverse operator learning paradigm, which aims to directly map observed data to
the solution of the inverse problem without requiring explicit knowledge of the
forward map. It highlights the unique challenge that noise plays in this
data-driven inversion setting, presents structure-aware architectures for both
point predictions and posterior estimates, and surveys relevant theory for
linear and nonlinear inverse problems. The chapter also discusses the
estimation of priors and regularizers, where operator learning is used more
selectively within classical inversion algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UME, a unified encoder for speaker diarization, speech separation, and multi-speaker automatic speech recognition, demonstrating superior performance on overlapping speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shared challenges and interdependencies among speaker diarization, speech separation, and multi-speaker ASR tasks by creating a unified approach.

Method: A shared speech foundational encoder, called UME, jointly learns representations for the three tasks. Residual weighted-sum encoding (RWSE) captures information from multiple layers of the encoder.

Result: UME outperforms task-specific baselines and achieves SOTA diarization error rates of 1.37% and 2.29% on Libri2Mix and Libri3Mix, respectively.

Conclusion: UME's joint training approach successfully captures task interdependencies and significantly enhances performance on overlapping speech tasks, marking a notable advancement in multi-speaker speech technology.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified multi-speaker encoder (UME), a novel
architecture that jointly learns representations for speaker diarization (SD),
speech separation (SS), and multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR)
tasks using a shared speech foundational encoder. We leverage the hidden
representations from multiple layers of UME as a residual weighted-sum encoding
(RWSE) to effectively use information from different semantic levels,
contributing to bottom-up alignment between tasks. This joint training approach
captures the inherent interdependencies among the tasks, enhancing overall
performance on overlapping speech data. Our evaluations demonstrate that UME
substantially improves over the single-task baselines dedicated to SD, SS, and
multi-speaker ASR on LibriMix evaluation sets. Notably, for SD, UME outperforms
the previous studies, achieving diarization error rates of 1.37% and 2.29% on
Libri2Mix and Libri3Mix evaluation sets, respectively.

*Hashim Ali,Surya Subramani,Shefali Sudhir,Raksha Varahamurthy,Hafiz Malik*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) voice spoof detection systems when subjected to laundering attacks, and finds that these systems struggle, especially against noise and reverberation-based laundering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice cloning technology has become highly realistic, enabling potential misuse. Current spoof detection systems are evaluated mostly under clean audio conditions, leaving their real-world robustness uncertain.

Method: The creation of the ASVSpoof Laundering Database, which involves laundering the ASVSpoof 2019 (LA) eval dataset, and evaluation of seven SOTA audio spoof detection systems under these conditions.

Result: SOTA systems perform poorly when evaluated against aggressive laundering attacks, such as reverberation and additive noise, highlighting their vulnerability.

Conclusion: There is a need for more robust audio spoof detection systems that can handle real-world laundering attacks effectively.

Abstract: Voice-cloning (VC) systems have seen an exceptional increase in the realism
of synthesized speech in recent years. The high quality of synthesized speech
and the availability of low-cost VC services have given rise to many potential
abuses of this technology. Several detection methodologies have been proposed
over the years that can detect voice spoofs with reasonably good accuracy.
However, these methodologies are mostly evaluated on clean audio databases,
such as ASVSpoof 2019. This paper evaluates SOTA Audio Spoof Detection
approaches in the presence of laundering attacks. In that regard, a new
laundering attack database, called the ASVSpoof Laundering Database, is
created. This database is based on the ASVSpoof 2019 (LA) eval database
comprising a total of 1388.22 hours of audio recordings. Seven SOTA audio spoof
detection approaches are evaluated on this laundered database. The results
indicate that SOTA systems perform poorly in the presence of aggressive
laundering attacks, especially reverberation and additive noise attacks. This
suggests the need for robust audio spoof detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce labor requirements in equipment inspections and enable preventive maintenance, addressing the challenges of visual inspection replacements and the high cost of new sensors.

Method: The study utilizes cameras and microphones to monitor and detect turnout switching errors in electronic point machines based on sound information, focusing on 'switch sound.'

Result: Testing of the sound-based error detection method yielded expected results, indicating its efficacy.

Conclusion: The proposed sound-based monitoring system can enable real-time detection of equipment failures, reducing dependency on visual inspections and enhancing preventive maintenance.

Abstract: Since 2018, East Japan Railway Company and Hitachi, Ltd. have been working to
replace human inspections with IoT-based monitoring. The purpose is
Labor-saving required for equipment inspections and provide appropriate
preventive maintenance. As an alternative to visual inspection, it has been
difficult to substitute electrical characteristic monitoring, and the
introduction of new high-performance sensors has been costly. In 2019, we
implemented cameras and microphones in an ``NS'' electric point machines to
reduce downtime from equipment failures, allowing for remote monitoring of
lock-piece conditions. This method for detecting turnout switching errors based
on sound information was proposed, and the expected test results were obtained.
The proposed method will make it possible to detect equipment failures in real
time, thereby reducing the need for visual inspections. This paper presents the
results of our technical studies aimed at automating the inspection of
electronic point machines using sound, specifically focusing on ``switch
sound'' beginning in 2019.

Conclusion: Demonstrated strong generalization and robustness in synthetic speech detection across multiple tasks.

Abstract: The SAFE Challenge evaluates synthetic speech detection across three tasks:
unmodified audio, processed audio with compression artifacts, and laundered
audio designed to evade detection. We systematically explore self-supervised
learning (SSL) front-ends, training data compositions, and audio length
configurations for robust deepfake detection. Our AASIST-based approach
incorporates WavLM large frontend with RawBoost augmentation, trained on a
multilingual dataset of 256,600 samples spanning 9 languages and over 70 TTS
systems from CodecFake, MLAAD v5, SpoofCeleb, Famous Figures, and MAILABS.
Through extensive experimentation with different SSL front-ends, three training
data versions, and two audio lengths, we achieved second place in both Task 1
(unmodified audio detection) and Task 3 (laundered audio detection),
demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Petabyte-scale data volumes are generated by observations and simulations in
modern astronomy and astrophysics. Storage, access, and data analysis are
significantly hampered by such data volumes and are leading to the development
of a new generation of software tools. The Visualization Interface for the
Virtual Observatory (VisIVO) has been designed, developed and maintained by
INAF since 2005 to perform multi-dimensional data analysis and knowledge
discovery in multivariate astrophysical datasets. Utilizing containerization
and virtualization technologies, VisIVO has already been used to exploit
distributed computing infrastructures including the European Open Science Cloud
(EOSC).
  We intend to adapt VisIVO solutions for high performance visualization of
data generated on the (pre-)Exascale systems by HPC applications in
Astrophysics and Cosmology (A\&C), including GADGET (GAlaxies with Dark matter
and Gas) and PLUTO simulations, thanks to the collaboration within the SPACE
Center of Excellence, the H2020 EUPEX Project, and the ICSC National Research
Centre. In this work, we outline the evolution's course as well as the
execution strategies designed to achieve the following goals: enhance the
portability of the VisIVO modular applications and their resource requirements;
foster reproducibility and maintainability; take advantage of a more flexible
resource exploitation over heterogeneous HPC facilities; and, finally, minimize
data-movement overheads and improve I/O performances.
