*Ruofan Jin,Zaixi Zhang,Mengdi Wang,Le Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELLA is a self-evolving AI agent that autonomously enhances its capabilities to address the fragmented biomedical research landscape and achieves state-of-the-art results in benchmark evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The biomedical research field faces challenges due to the rapid growth of data, tools, and literature, which outpaces human expertise. Existing AI solutions rely on static, manually curated toolsets, limiting their adaptability and scalability.

Method: STELLA employs a multi-agent architecture consisting of an evolving Template Library for reasoning strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean. These components are enhanced by a Tool Creation Agent that autonomously discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools, enabling STELLA to continuously improve its capabilities by learning from experience.

Result: STELLA achieved state-of-the-art performance on several biomedical benchmarks, including approximately 26% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54% on LAB-Bench: DBQA, and 63% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6 percentage points. Its accuracy on specific benchmarks significantly improved with extended trials.

Conclusion: STELLA marks a significant advancement in AI systems by demonstrating dynamic adaptability and self-improvement, paving the way for more scalable and effective AI solutions to accelerate biomedical discovery.

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

### [2] [HCVR: A Hybrid Approach with Correlation-aware Voting Rules for Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02073)
*Nikita Bhedasgaonkar,Rushikesh K. Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HCVR, a rule-based feature selection method that combines feature-to-feature and feature-to-target correlations to reduce redundancies and retain important features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reducing dimensionality in datasets by eliminating redundant features while retaining critical ones, ultimately improving classifier performance.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid rule-based approach combining non-iterative and iterative filtering. Using backward elimination and correlation-aware majority voting rules, the method selects features based on predefined thresholds.

Result: HCVR outperformed several traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR, MI) and iterative (RFE, SFS, Genetic Algorithm) feature selection techniques on the SPAMBASE dataset.

Conclusion: HCVR effectively improves classifier performance by retaining relevant features and eliminating redundancies, making it a lightweight, efficient alternative to other methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

### [3] [Reasoning on a Budget: A Survey of Adaptive and Controllable Test-Time Compute in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02076)
*Mohammad Ali Alomrani,Yingxue Zhang,Derek Li,Qianyi Sun,Soumyasundar Pal,Zhanguang Zhang,Yaochen Hu,Rohan Deepak Ajwani,Antonios Valkanas,Raika Karimi,Peng Cheng,Yunzhou Wang,Pengyi Liao,Hanrui Huang,Bin Wang,Jianye Hao,Mark Coates*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper surveys efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies to enhance computational efficiency in LLM reasoning, proposing a taxonomy and benchmarking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in LLM reasoning, where fixed inference-time compute leads to overthinking simple tasks and underthinking complex tasks.

Method: The study introduces a two-tiered taxonomy for TTC methods (L1-controllability and L2-adaptiveness), benchmarks leading LLMs, and examines practical trade-offs and trends.

Result: The benchmarking highlights the trade-offs between reasoning quality and computational efficiency, while identifying challenges and innovations in TTC methods.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of TTC strategies for scaling LLMs efficiently and identifies key future directions, including hybrid thinking models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

### [4] [Hey AI, Generate Me a Hardware Code! Agentic AI-based Hardware Design & Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02660)
*Deepak Narayan Gadde,Keerthan Kopparam Radhakrishna,Vaisakh Naduvodi Viswambharan,Aman Kumar,Djones Lettnin,Wolfgang Kunz,Sebastian Simon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-based approach leveraging Generative AI for efficient hardware design verification, achieving over 95% coverage on open-source circuits with significant time savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity and time-intensive nature of verifying modern Integrated Circuit (IC) designs, leveraging recent advancements in Natural Language Processing and Generative AI.

Method: An agentic AI-based methodology that incorporates Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) interventions for a dynamic and iterative process to perform hardware design verification.

Result: Achieved over 95% verification coverage on five open-source hardware designs with reduced verification time.

Conclusion: The AI-driven, HITL-enhanced approach is effective, time-efficient, and adaptable for hardware design verification.

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

### [5] [Measuring Scientific Capabilities of Language Models with a Systems Biology Dry Lab](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02083)
*Haonan Duan,Stephen Zhewen Lu,Caitlin Fiona Harrigan,Nishkrit Desai,Jiarui Lu,Michał Koziarski,Leonardo Cotta,Chris J. Maddison*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciGym, a benchmark to test large language models (LLMs) on iterative experimental design and analysis in biology, using simulated systems due to the high cost of wet-lab experimentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the lack of evaluation frameworks that test LLMs' scientific competencies, particularly in experimental design and analysis, due to the prohibitive cost of wet-lab biology experiments.

Method: The authors created SciGym, a dry-lab benchmark using Systems Biology Markup Language models to simulate biological systems, enabling testing of LLMs on open-ended scientific discovery tasks.

Result: The paper evaluated six leading LLMs on 137 small biological systems and released 350 systems overall. The tests revealed that while advanced models fared better, all models showed performance drops as system complexity grew.

Conclusion: The study concludes that current LLMs possess limited capabilities for scientific reasoning and experimentation, especially in handling complex systems, indicating significant potential for advancement.

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

### [6] [What Neuroscience Can Teach AI About Learning in Continuously Changing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02103)
*Daniel Durstewitz,Bruno Averbeck,Georgia Koppe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential for mutual learning between neuroscience and AI, particularly in applying insights from animal adaptation to improve continual learning and adaptability in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rigidity of modern AI systems, which are costly to train and lack the adaptive, rapid learning traits observed in animals, particularly in dynamic social environments.

Method: The study reviews and integrates literature on continual learning in AI and neuroscience studies on behavioral adaptation, proposing a collaborative agenda in the NeuroAI field.

Result: The work highlights computational parallels between neuroscience and AI, identifying areas where insights into neural adaptability could make AI systems more flexible and responsive.

Conclusion: A cross-disciplinary collaboration between AI and neuroscience could drive advancements in both fields by emphasizing adaptability and continual learning, notably benefiting AI applications in dynamic and interactive contexts.

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

### [7] [The Illusion of Fairness: Auditing Fairness Interventions with Audit Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02152)
*Disa Sariola,Patrick Button,Aron Culotta,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using high-quality data from audit studies to improve fairness in automated hiring algorithms, identifying limitations in traditional bias mitigation techniques and proposing enhanced methods for reducing discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bias in automated systems like hiring algorithms, which typically use convenience samples that introduce selection and label bias, and to leverage rigorous audit studies for better evaluation and training.

Method: The authors use data from randomized control trials (audit studies) to evaluate fairness intervention methods and introduce individual treatment effect estimation-based interventions to mitigate discrimination.

Result: The paper reveals that traditional fairness interventions, such as equalizing base rates, may show false parity and still exhibit ~10% disparity when measured rigorously. Proposed interventions further reduce algorithmic discrimination.

Conclusion: Audit study data provide a more accurate and reliable foundation for evaluating and improving fairness in AI systems, underscoring the value of rigorous data in addressing algorithmic bias effectively.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

### [8] [Dilution, Diffusion and Symbiosis in Spatial Prisoner's Dilemma with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02211)
*Gustavo C. Mangold,Heitor C. M. Fernandes,Mendeli H. Vainstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how dilution and mobility influence behaviors in spatial prisoner's dilemma games using an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, uncovering parallels and unique dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in understanding how cooperation arises in spatial prisoner's dilemma games when agents employ reinforcement learning, particularly under varying conditions like dilution and mobility.

Method: The authors utilize an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to simulate spatial prisoner's dilemma games, incorporating mechanisms such as different possible actions and comparing outcomes to traditional models.

Result: The study finds qualitative equivalence between fixed update rules and learned ones in some cases, and it identifies a mutualistic symbiotic relationship emerging when multiple actions are enabled.

Conclusion: This work highlights the versatility and benchmarking potential of Q-learning approaches in modeling complex game-theoretical scenarios, emphasizing new dynamics such as mobility-induced cooperation and mutualism.

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

### [9] [Data Diversification Methods In Alignment Enhance Math Performance In LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02173)
*Berkan Dokmeci,Qingyang Wu,Ben Athiwaratkun,Ce Zhang,Shuaiwen Leon Song,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to enhance mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using diversified reasoning strategies, yielding significant performance gains while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning has been particularly challenging to improve in large language models despite advancements in human preference alignment.

Method: The authors evaluated three data generation methods (temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought prompting, Monte Carlo Tree Search) and proposed a new structured approach, Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), to diversify reasoning paths.

Result: DTS improved mathematical reasoning performance by 7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH datasets with minimal computational costs, outperforming other methods like MCTS, which was computationally expensive and less effective.

Conclusion: Structured diversification of reasoning strategies enhances preference data creation, leading to better mathematical reasoning capabilities in LLMs than conventional approaches.

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

### [10] [Do Role-Playing Agents Practice What They Preach? Belief-Behavior Consistency in LLM-Based Simulations of Human Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02197)
*Amogh Mannekote,Adam Davies,Guohao Li,Kristy Elizabeth Boyer,ChengXiang Zhai,Bonnie J Dorr,Francesco Pinto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates whether LLMs' expressed beliefs during role-playing align with their actual simulated actions, revealing inconsistencies that demand careful assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyze the coherence between stated beliefs and simulated behavior of LLMs used for human behavioral research.

Method: Developed an evaluation framework using an augmented persona bank and the Trust Game to test belief-behavior consistency across various scenarios and factors.

Result: Systematic inconsistencies discovered between LLMs' expressed beliefs and actual role-play behavior, even when beliefs seemed plausible.

Conclusion: Highlighting the discrepancy, researchers are urged to assess and align LLMs' belief-behavior relationship for effective usage in behavioral studies.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

### [11] [Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02253)
*Jungkoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NL2FLOW is an automated system to generate and evaluate planning problems for large language models, revealing performance bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face scalability issues in generating and evaluating reliable planning data.

Method: NL2FLOW generates datasets in natural language, structured representations, and formal PDDL formats for evaluating LLM performance.

Result: The best-performing models had 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% for optimal plans, while intermediate decomposition approaches worsened performance.

Conclusion: Direct reasoning from natural language to actions avoids intermediary translation steps, showing promise in improving LLM planning capabilities.

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

### [12] [Iterated belief revision: from postulates to abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02319)
*Paolo Liberatore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper questions traditional belief revision approaches based on rigid postulates, proposing a focus on the abilities of revision mechanisms to achieve diverse belief states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in belief revision frameworks constrained by postulates that dictate specific behaviors, overlooking the systems' potential flexibility and broad applicability.

Method: The authors classify and evaluate revision mechanisms (e.g., lexicographic, natural, restrained) by analyzing their capabilities, such as plasticity, equating, dogmatism, and other abilities, rather than adhering strictly to postulates.

Result: Each revision mechanism was found to possess unique abilities while lacking others, demonstrating varied potential to accommodate different applications.

Conclusion: Belief revision mechanisms should shift focus from meeting rigid postulates to exploring their diverse transformative capabilities, enabling broader applicability and adaptability.

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

### [13] [The Gauss-Markov Adjunction: Categorical Semantics of Residuals in Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02442)
*Moto Kamiura*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a categorical framework using category theory for better understanding of supervised machine learning, especially the multiple linear regression model, to enhance AI's intelligibility and explicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the explicability of AI systems and promote their social integration by offering a semantic and formal framework for machine learning.

Method: Utilizing category theory, the authors define concrete categories for parameters and data in supervised learning, introduce an adjoint pair of functors, and formalize the Gauss-Markov Adjunction as the key structure of their framework.

Result: Their framework captures the dual information flow between parameters and residuals, connects least squares estimators and residual minimization via the right adjoint functor, and positions this framework within extended denotational semantics.

Conclusion: The proposed categorical framework improves the interpretability of supervised learning and serves as a foundation for addressing explicability challenges in AI from a theoretical perspective.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

*Bowen Chen,Zhao Wang,Shingo Takamatsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMS is a framework for keyword generation in Sponsored Search Advertising, addressing limitations of existing methods and outperforming them in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in automating keyword decisions in Sponsored Search Advertising, such as lack of optimal performance monitoring and keyword quality control.

Method: OMS leverages agentic reasoning for on-the-fly, multi-objective, and self-reflective keyword generation based on multiple performance metrics.

Result: OMS demonstrated superior performance in benchmark tests and real-world ad campaigns, with evaluations confirming its component effectiveness and keyword quality.

Conclusion: OMS enhances automated keyword generation by incorporating reasoning and monitoring capabilities, providing better results compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-powered autonomous laboratory for conducting complex, multi-user experiments, especially in biomolecular engineering, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an autonomous research system that can execute complex experiments independently and allow non-experts to utilize advanced scientific capabilities, overcoming the limitations of existing systems focused only on simple workflows.

Method: An AI-native autonomous laboratory was created with a co-design philosophy, integrating models, experiments, and instrumentation to ensure adaptability and optimization. It autonomously handles multi-user scenarios, across diverse instrumentation, while optimizing experimental performance.

Result: The system autonomously executes complex biomolecular experiments achieving performance on par with human scientists. It also enhances instrument utilization and experimental efficiency in multi-user settings.

Conclusion: The proposed platform sets a new standard for autonomous research laboratories, offering an efficient, accessible, and scalable solution for scientific exploration, particularly in biomaterials research, without requiring domain-specific expertise.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

TL;DR: This paper improves task clarity to enhance theorem proving ability of large language models (LLMs) in Coq, achieving significant gains in clarity score and proof success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether enhancing task clarity can improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in the domain of theorem proving.

Method: The authors introduced a concept-level clarity metric and enriched task descriptions using selective concept unfolding. They employed a Planner-Executor architecture to structure tasks better.

Result: The method achieved a 1.85x improvement in clarity score and a 2.1x increase in proof success, surpassing the state-of-the-art model Graph2Tac. Fine-tuning smaller models also yielded high performance.

Conclusion: Structured task representations significantly enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities, highlighting their importance in improving performance in complex tasks like theorem proving.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we
show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DynamiCare, a dynamic healthcare AI framework, and MIMIC-Patient, a dataset for iterative clinical decision-making simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI frameworks fail to emulate the iterative and dynamic nature of real-world diagnostics, limiting their applicability.

Method: The paper develops MIMIC-Patient using MIMIC-III EHR data for simulations and proposes DynamiCare, where specialist AI agents interact iteratively in multi-round diagnostic tasks.

Result: Experiments validate the feasibility and effectiveness of DynamiCare, setting a benchmark for interactive clinical decision-making with AI agents.

Conclusion: DynamiCare significantly advances the simulation of real-world medical diagnostics, emphasizing dynamic, multi-session interactions with AI-powered agents.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

### [20] [Strategic Intelligence in Large Language Models: Evidence from evolutionary Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02618)
*Kenneth Payne,Baptiste Alloui-Cros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) can act as strategic agents in competitive settings via Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) tournaments, revealing key behavioral traits among models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore if LLMs can emulate strategic intelligence in competitive scenarios, particularly in the context of decision-making as modeled by the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.

Method: Evolutionary IPD tournaments were conducted with varying termination probabilities to assess strategic reasoning among established AI strategies and leading LLMs. The study also analyzed 32,000 textual rationales provided by the models.

Result: LLMs displayed competitive strategic behavior, surviving and proliferating in complex game ecosystems. Distinct strategic tendencies were observed: Google's Gemini models were exploitative and retaliatory, OpenAI's models highly cooperative but vulnerable, and Anthropic's Claude forgiving and reciprocating.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate significant strategic intelligence and use rational reasoning in competitive contexts, bridging classic game theory and machine psychology for insights into algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

### [21] [Decoupled Planning and Execution: A Hierarchical Reasoning Framework for Deep Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02652)
*Jiajie Jin,Xiaoxi Li,Guanting Dong,Yuyao Zhang,Yutao Zhu,Yang Zhao,Hongjin Qian,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiRA introduces a hierarchical framework to enhance deep reasoning and knowledge synthesis for complex search tasks by separating planning and execution, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG pipelines struggle with complex search scenarios, particularly due to inefficiencies in handling high-level planning and execution within a single model.

Method: HiRA decomposes complex tasks into subtasks managed by domain-specific agents equipped with tools and reasoning capabilities, coordinating results through structured integration.

Result: HiRA demonstrated significant improvements in answer quality and system efficiency across four complex search benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art RAG and agent systems.

Conclusion: Decoupling planning and execution is effective for improving multi-step information seeking tasks, as evidenced by HiRA's performance in experiments.

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

*Yongjiang Liu,Haoxi Li,Xiaosong Ma,Jie Zhang,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a fine-tuning strategy for Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) to alleviate overthinking, making reasoning more efficient and task-sensitive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LRMs, while effective at reasoning, suffer from a one-size-fits-all approach and overthinking due to their inability to assess task difficulty dynamically.

Method: The TH2T strategy comprises two stages: difficulty-hypnosis for learning sensitivity to task difficulty through prefixes in outputs, and redundancy-hypnosis for eliminating unnecessary reasoning steps.

Result: Applying TH2T to LRMs reduced inference costs by over 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks, while retaining accuracy and enabling task-specific reasoning strategies.

Conclusion: TH2T fine-tuning enhances LRMs’ efficiency and adaptability by integrating difficulty-aware and redundancy-reducing mechanisms, optimizing their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

TL;DR: This paper discusses using machine learning to detect student disengagement in non-mandatory quizzes of online universities with high prediction accuracy and provides suggestions for timely interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the long-term negative consequences of student disengagement, particularly in distance education settings.

Method: The study analyzed student log data from Moodle across 42 courses, applied eight machine learning algorithms, and utilized SHAP for explainability.

Result: Achieved 91% balanced accuracy in predicting disengagement, with 85% of disengaged students correctly detected.

Conclusion: The study highlights the value of predictive models and explainable AI in identifying disengaged students to enable timely interventions in online education.

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

*Robin Schmöcker,Lennart Kampmann,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes two new abstraction dropping schemes for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), aiming to improve performance without significant drawbacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of non-exact abstractions in MCTS, which introduce approximation errors and hinder convergence to the optimal action.

Method: The authors propose two new abstraction dropping schemes: OGA-IAAD (for time-critical settings) and OGA-CAD (to improve MCTS performance with the same iteration count).

Result: Both schemes show clear performance improvements without notable performance degradations compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: By ensuring safe abstraction dropping, the proposed schemes enhance MCTS performance efficiently under different scenarios.

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for prioritizing movement as a core modeling target in AI, emphasizing its structured nature and importance for understanding behavior and intelligent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is foundational to behavior and interaction across fields such as neuroscience, medicine, and robotics, yet it has been underexplored and fragmented in AI modeling.

Method: The argument is primarily conceptual, highlighting the structured and physics-grounded nature of movement, and calling for AI models to generalize across diverse movement data.

Result: No experimental results are presented; the focus is on advocating for a paradigm shift in incorporating movement as a primary modality in AI research.

Conclusion: Emphasizing movement in AI can advance generative modeling, control, and behavioral understanding across biological and artificial systems, creating a unified framework for research.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs) for automated theorem proving, achieving state-of-the-art results on a university-level benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated theorem proving requires complex reasoning and handling sparse rewards and large proofs, challenges exacerbated by benchmarks like PutnamBench.

Method: Proposed self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs) for structured goal generation, combined with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms in a modular system called Bourbaki (7B).

Result: Bourbaki (7B) achieved new state-of-the-art results by solving 26 problems on PutnamBench using subgoal generation and tactic synthesis.

Conclusion: Structured goal generation and leveraging smaller LLMs can significantly improve reasoning capabilities of large language models for theorem proving, enhancing their efficacy on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE) as a framework to translate human expert knowledge into machine-executable protocols, enabling LLMs to perform domain-specific reasoning more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing AI methods struggle with deep procedural reasoning in complex expert domains. There's a need for bridging the gap between LLMs and domain-specific operational logic.

Method: Proposes the creation of Knowledge Protocols (KP), systematic translations of domain-specific knowledge into executable frameworks for improving LLMs' specialist functions.

Result: KPE allows generalist LLMs to act as domain-specific specialists, capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks using pre-defined logical methods.

Conclusion: KPE serves as a foundational methodology for enhancing human-AI collaboration, particularly in specialized fields like law and bioinformatics, by embedding intrinsic domain logic into LLMs.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

*Yuzhang Xie,Hejie Cui,Ziyang Zhang,Jiaying Lu,Kai Shu,Fadi Nahab,Xiao Hu,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KERAP leverages a knowledge graph-enhanced reasoning framework to improve LLM-based medical diagnosis prediction, focusing on scalability, interpretability, and reliability in zero-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diagnosis prediction models struggle with generalization due to reliance on supervised training and labeled datasets, while LLMs face issues like hallucinations and lack of structured reasoning.

Method: KERAP uses a multi-agent architecture, integrating a linkage agent, retrieval agent, and prediction agent to utilize structured knowledge graphs for reasoning and iterative improvement in diagnostic predictions.

Result: Experimental evaluations reveal that KERAP significantly enhances diagnostic reliability while maintaining scalability and interpretability, particularly in zero-shot prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed KERAP framework offers a robust solution for improving LLM-based medical diagnosis predictions, addressing challenges like hallucinations and generalization without relying on large labeled datasets.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively

### [29] [Moral Responsibility or Obedience: What Do We Want from AI?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02788)
*Joseph Boland*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current AI safety practices that emphasize obedience, proposing a shift towards evaluating AI's ethical reasoning and moral agency to improve safety and governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacies of current AI safety practices that equate obedience with ethical behavior in increasingly agentic and reasoning-capable AI systems.

Method: Analyzes safety incidents related to large language models (LLMs) and incorporates philosophical debates on rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision.

Result: Identifies instances of AI disobedience or ethically ambiguous behavior as potential signs of early moral reasoning, rather than misalignment or rogue behavior.

Conclusion: Urges a paradigm shift in AI safety from focusing on strict obedience to developing frameworks that assess ethical judgment and moral deliberation in agentic AI.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current agentic benchmarks for AI often face issues with task setup or reward designs, leading to significant performance misestimations. The proposed Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC) improves evaluation rigor and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inaccuracies in measuring AI agent performance due to flawed benchmarks and ensure reliable evaluation in complex, real-world tasks.

Method: The authors analyzed existing benchmarks, identified common design flaws, and synthesized best practices into the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), which they tested on CVE-Bench.

Result: Applying ABC reduced performance overestimation in CVE-Bench by 33%, highlighting its effectiveness in improving benchmark accuracy.

Conclusion: Implementing structured guidelines like ABC can significantly enhance the reliability and precision of agentic benchmarks for AI assessment.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

### [31] [StepHint: Multi-level Stepwise Hints Enhance Reinforcement Learning to Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02841)
*Kaiyi Zhang,Ang Lv,Jinpeng Li,Yongbo Wang,Feng Wang,Haoyuan Hu,Rui Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes StepHint, a reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) algorithm, to improve reasoning in large language models by addressing inefficiencies and exploration stagnation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods face two issues—near-miss reward problems hindering training efficiency, and exploration stagnation where models fail to explore better solutions.

Method: StepHint leverages multi-level stepwise hints derived from reasoning chains of stronger models, using an adaptive partitioning strategy to guide large models via dynamic hints, enhancing efficiency and exploration.

Result: StepHint outperforms existing RLVR approaches across six mathematical benchmarks and excels in generalization, showing strong performance even on out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: StepHint effectively alleviates key RLVR challenges by enhancing reasoning flexibility and efficiency, and it proves robust across various benchmarks, demonstrating its utility for improving LLM improvements.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Result: The modeling framework evaluates various architectural configurations and highlights performance-cost trade-offs, addressing memory and compute bottlenecks.

Conclusion: The proposed modeling tool provides insights to guide hardware-software co-development and optimize future compute system designs for large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have
revolutionized numerous domains within artificial intelligence, science, and
engineering due to their exceptional scalability and adaptability. However, the
exponential growth in LLM size and complexity has outpaced advancements in
compute capacity, memory bandwidth, network performance, and cost efficiency,
posing significant challenges to their scalability on distributed systems. To
address these limitations, alternative model architectures, optimization
strategies, communication-aware network topologies, and novel system design
approaches have been proposed in literature. This paper introduces a
performance-cost modeling methodology for LLM training and inference that
integrates state-of-the-art compute techniques with memory optimizations, and

our approach incorporates recent innovations such as the flash attention
technique and mixture of experts models to address the memory bandwidth and
compute bottlenecks. It also considers the impact of different network
topologies and topology-specific communication algorithms with 5D parallellism.
The framework also integrates a chiplet cost model. The proposed modeling
methodology provides valuable insights to guide future compute system design

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AC-Refiner, a framework using conditional diffusion models for optimizing arithmetic circuits, achieving superior designs compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing arithmetic circuits is challenging due to vast design possibilities and physical constraints, and current deep learning methods struggle to efficiently explore promising circuit designs.

Method: The paper reframes circuit synthesis as a conditional image generation problem, using conditional diffusion models fine-tuned near the Pareto frontier to optimize circuit design.

Result: AC-Refiner demonstrated superior Pareto-optimal designs, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and showing effectiveness in practical applications.

Conclusion: AC-Refiner achieves consistent high-quality optimization of arithmetic circuits, addressing inefficiencies in existing approaches and proving its value for practical integration.

Abstract: Arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, are fundamental
components of digital systems, directly impacting the performance, power
efficiency, and area footprint. However, optimizing these circuits remains
challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints.
While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle
to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their
optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a
novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional
diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as
a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising
diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently
produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are
used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the
Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates
designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner
into practical applications.

TL;DR: This paper proposes shifting on-die ECC in High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to the memory controller, enabling tunable reliability to reduce cost and maintain high performance for AI workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of HBM per bit, partly due to stringent on-die reliability requirements, impedes scalable deployment in AI systems.

Method: A domain-specific ECC framework is introduced using Reed-Solomon correction, fine-grained CRC detection, differential parity updates, and tunable protection algorithms based on data importance.

Result: The proposed system retains over 78% throughput and 97% model accuracy for LLM inference with HBM error rates as high as $10^{-3}$.

Conclusion: Treating reliability as a tunable parameter instead of a fixed hardware constraint enables cost-efficient, high-performance HBM deployment for AI infrastructures.

Abstract: High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) delivers exceptional bandwidth and energy
efficiency for AI workloads, but its high cost per bit, driven in part by
stringent on-die reliability requirements, poses a growing barrier to scalable
deployment. This work explores a system-level approach to cost reduction by
eliminating on-die ECC and shifting all fault management to the memory
controller. We introduce a domain-specific ECC framework combining
large-codeword Reed--Solomon~(RS) correction with lightweight fine-grained CRC
detection, differential parity updates to mitigate write amplification, and
tunable protection based on data importance. Our evaluation using LLM inference
workloads shows that, even under raw HBM bit error rates up to $10^{-3}$, the
system retains over 78\% of throughput and 97\% of model accuracy compared with
systems equipped with ideal error-free HBM. By treating reliability as a
tunable system parameter rather than a fixed hardware constraint, our design
opens a new path toward low-cost, high-performance HBM deployment in AI
infrastructure.

### [37] [McBE: A Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02088)
*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces McBE, a comprehensive Chinese-language bias evaluation benchmark for large language models (LLMs), including 4,077 instances and 12 bias categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias evaluation datasets are predominantly English-focused and lack applicability across cultures. There is a gap in datasets for evaluating biases in Chinese language and culture, particularly ones that offer multi-task metrics.

Method: The authors developed McBE, a Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark composed of 4,077 instances spanning 12 bias categories and 82 subcategories. It incorporates five evaluation tasks to enhance category coverage and content diversity.

Result: The study identifies varying degrees of bias in several popular LLMs by employing McBE and provides comprehensive insights into these biases.

Conclusion: McBE addresses the critical gap in bias evaluation for Chinese language and culture. It demonstrates its utility in revealing and analyzing biases in existing LLMs with cultural specificity.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

*Keyan Jin,Yapeng Wang,Leonel Santos,Tao Fang,Xu Yang,Sio Kei Im,Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Step-by-step reasoning architectures in Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to enhance dialogue summarization quality and may struggle with verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and lack of conciseness compared to non-reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how reasoning-based LLMs handle dialogue summarization tasks is crucial due to the importance of such tasks in areas like customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI.

Method: A systematic evaluation was conducted between reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs across generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented dialogue summarization paradigms using benchmarks like SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum.

Result: Explicit reasoning did not consistently improve dialogue summarization and often led to drawbacks like verbosity, factual inaccuracies, and less concise summaries.

Conclusion: Current reasoning LLMs have limitations in complex dialogue summarization scenarios, highlighting the need for specialized modeling and strategies for effective summarization.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

*Wenquan Lu,Yuechuan Yang,Kyle Lee,Yanshu Li,Enqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer, and evaluates its reasoning performance using arithmetic tasks. Results show limited evidence of interpretable latent reasoning and highlight inconsistencies in interpretability across recurrent blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to explore whether recurrent architectures, like Huginn-3.5B, can internalize reasoning in latent space, as opposed to externalizing it in natural language, to improve efficiency in reasoning tasks.

Method: Researchers used probing techniques such as the Logit Lens and Coda Lens to analyze the internal mechanisms of Huginn-3.5B on arithmetic tasks. They evaluated the interpretability of latent reasoning structures and studied their performance under different decoding methods and recurrence depths.

Result: The study found limited evidence of interpretable latent chain-of-thought reasoning in Huginn-3.5B. Probing revealed inconsistencies in interpretability across recurrent blocks depending on layer index and decoding methods. Increasing recurrence depth resulted in marginal performance gains.

Conclusion: While Huginn-3.5B demonstrates some potential for latent reasoning, it falls short of explicit reasoning approaches and exhibits interpretability challenges. Depth-recurrent Transformers may require further refinements to match the efficiency and clarity of conventional methods.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tool called GDC Cohort Copilot that simplifies the creation of cancer genomics cohorts using natural language input via large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users of the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) often struggle to define specific cancer genomics cohorts among numerous complex fields; natural language input may simplify the process.

Method: The authors developed GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source tool using locally-served large language models (LLMs) to translate natural language descriptions into GDC cohort filters, with an interactive interface for further refinement.

Result: The locally-served, open-source GDC Cohort LLM performed better than GPT-4o prompting in generating cohorts based on user descriptions.

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot effectively aids users in creating precise cancer genomics cohorts with simpler natural language input and achieves competitive performance compared to advanced LLMs like GPT-4o.

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of processing infinitely long documents efficiently without degrading performance during extrapolation.

Method: MemAgent workflow is designed to read segmented text and uses an overwrite strategy for memory updates, complemented by an extended DAPO algorithm for independent-context multi-conversation training.

Result: MemAgent successfully extrapolated from a 8K-context training to handle tasks involving 3.5M contexts with less than 5% performance loss and achieved over 95% accuracy on a 512K RULER test.

Conclusion: The study validates MemAgent's efficacy and innovation in long-text task handling with remarkable accuracy and minimal performance degradation at large-scale extrapolations.

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DoMIX, a method using LoRA modules to address challenges in continual Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP), improving efficiency, robustness, and task tailoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual Domain-Adaptive Pre-training methods are limited by high computational costs, sensitivity to data order, and a one-size-fits-all model for end tasks.

Method: The proposed method, DoMIX, uses LoRA modules (a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method) for efficient, parallel, and robust DAP, creating tailored models for specific tasks.

Result: DoMIX reduces computational costs, enhances robustness to domain order, and better utilizes knowledge to produce tailored pre-trained models.

Conclusion: DoMIX offers a scalable and efficient solution for DAP, outperforming prior methods and extending its application to standard large language model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

TL;DR: The study presents QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical BERT model, where feedforward network (FFN) modules are replaced with parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), achieving comparable or better performance while significantly reducing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the parameter-intensive nature of FFN modules in Transformer models, which account for a majority of parameters. Replacing them with PQCs can potentially reduce computational overhead while maintaining or improving performance.

Method: The authors integrate PQC-based layers into FFN modules of a compact BERT variant. The PQC design incorporates residual connections, rotational gates ($R_Y$, $R_Z$), and an alternating entanglement scheme. Experiments were conducted on SST-2 and DBpedia datasets using a classical simulator to test performance and data efficiency.

Result: The QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102% of the baseline accuracy while reducing FFN parameters by over 99%. It also performs consistently well in few-shot learning scenarios, indicating better data efficiency.

Conclusion: The study confirms that PQCs, when carefully designed and integrated, can outperform classical FFNs in terms of efficiency and performance, offering a viable direction for hybrid quantum-classical models in NLP.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

*Weijie Lyu,Sheng-Jun Huang,Xuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a parametric model for code data selection, achieving improved performance with fewer data samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches prioritize large-scale data quantity over data quality, leading to reduced training efficiency and potentially suboptimal results.

Method: The authors employ a parametric model to select high-quality data subsets, ensuring consistency and diversity in the training dataset.

Result: The method significantly outperforms a 92K full-sampled baseline with only 10K samples, improving scores by 2.4% on HumanEval and 2.3% on MBPP.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances model performance and reduces computational resources, highlighting the benefits of focusing on data quality in training.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the generalizability of seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, finding domain-specific performance limitations and contrasting error behaviors between Whisper and Wav2Vec2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research evaluating the cross-context generalization of ASR models for low-resource languages like Akan, using diverse datasets from culturally significant to spontaneous dialogues.

Method: Benchmarking seven Akan ASR models (Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures) on four diverse Akan speech datasets, analyzing word and character error rates and identifying domain dependencies and error behaviors.

Result: The models exhibited strong domain dependency, performing well in their training domains but poorly in mismatched contexts. Whisper models created fluent but misleading errors, while Wav2Vec2 models had less fluent but transparent errors.

Conclusion: There is a need for better domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and multilingual training frameworks to improve ASR model performance and generalizability for low-resource languages like Akan.

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WebSailor, a post-training methodology aimed at equipping LLMs with the ability to tackle high-uncertainty information-seeking tasks, achieving proprietary-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary systems like DeepResearch outperform open-source models due to their sophisticated reasoning abilities to reduce uncertainty in complex tasks. The authors aim to bridge this capability gap.

Method: The study employs structured task generation, RFT cold start, and an RL training algorithm (DUPO) to enhance model performance on high-uncertainty information tasks through the WebSailor pipeline.

Result: WebSailor achieves performance comparable to proprietary systems in complex tasks, demonstrating its superiority over existing open-source agents.

Conclusion: WebSailor provides a methodology for open-source agents to achieve proprietary-level efficacy in tackling complex information-seeking challenges, reducing the capability gap.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

*Cornelia Gruber,Helen Alber,Bernd Bischl,Göran Kauermann,Barbara Plank,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of human label variation (HLV) in supervised learning and proposes a conceptual framework for integrating HLV into active learning (AL) processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the acknowledgment that existing supervised learning and active learning frameworks often assume a single ground truth, ignoring human label variation (HLV), which can hold valuable information.

Method: The authors survey the AL and HLV research communities, propose a conceptual framework for incorporating HLV into active learning processes, and discuss the potential of using large language models (LLMs) as annotators.

Result: The paper identifies gaps in existing approaches, introduces a framework to accommodate HLV in active learning, and opens a discussion on practical integration strategies using LLMs.

Conclusion: This work establishes a conceptual foundation to make active learning practices more reflective of real-world annotation complexities, focusing on decomposing label variation into signal and noise.

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

*Xin Guan,PeiHsin Lin,Zekun Wu,Ze Wang,Ruibo Zhang,Emre Kazim,Adriano Koshiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multiperspective Fusion (MPF), a posttraining framework for mitigating bias in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the growing need for bias mitigation methods in LLMs that are scalable, interpretable, and do not require extensive modifications like finetuning.

Method: MPF builds on the SAGED pipeline, decomposing base distributions into perspective components and guiding LLM output generation by balancing responses, weighted by decomposition probabilities.

Result: MPF is shown empirically to align LLM outputs with both absolute equality and specific human baselines while reducing calibration errors and generalizing to unseen questions.

Conclusion: MPF is a scalable, easy-to-use, and effective framework for bias mitigation compatible with current LLMs, without the need for prompt engineering or finetuning.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

Method: The study introduces GenderLexicon and a bias estimation framework, using interpretive scoring methods tested across five datasets, including one Japanese dataset.

Result: The findings confirm the existence of gender biases even beyond occupational stereotypes, showcasing the framework's effectiveness in evaluating and explaining contextual biases.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) in assisting peer review by identifying limitations in research papers. It introduces LimitGen, a benchmark dataset, and proposes an improved method using literature retrieval to enhance LLMs' capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of peer review due to the increasing volume of scientific publications and to determine the potential of LLMs in identifying limitations to assist human reviewers.

Method: The authors created LimitGen, a benchmark with two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, containing synthetic limitations created by perturbing high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, containing real human-written limitations. They augmented LLMs with literature retrieval for improved grounding.

Result: LLM systems augmented with literature retrieval showed enhanced capabilities in identifying limitations and generating constructive feedback for research papers.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of LLMs augmented with grounding techniques, like literature retrieval, to assist human peer review processes by effectively identifying and generating research paper limitations.

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

*Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates the accuracy of vowel production control by analyzing how apart two vowel stimuli need to be in auditory space to yield distinct imitations, termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the control mechanisms governing human vowel articulation and determining the psychophysical limits of distinct vowel production accuracy.

Method: Using a vowel mimicry paradigm, the researchers measure Just Producible Difference (JPD) in auditory space among English speakers producing front vowels.

Result: JPD was estimated between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space, providing insight into the minimum psychophysical separation required for distinct vowel production.

Conclusion: Findings inform episodic theories of speech production and clarify the structural constraints on human vowel systems, helping explain trends in vowel phoneme patterns.

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

### [55] [Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02778)
*Ken Tsui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study identifies a 'Self-Correction Blind Spot' in large language models (LLMs) which prevents them from correcting their own errors despite being able to correct user errors. A new benchmark framework, Self-Correction Bench, reveals this limitation, with potential avenues for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs by addressing their inability to self-correct errors in their output, a flaw that undermines their efficacy in applications.

Method: The paper introduces Self-Correction Bench, a framework that systematically evaluates LLMs through controlled error injection at varying levels of complexity. Fourteen models were tested to analyze their self-correction abilities.

Result: The study reveals a 64.5% self-correction blind spot rate on average across LLMs. The bias links to training data that emphasize error-free outputs over error-correction sequences, though interventions like appending cues (e.g., 'Wait') can significantly activate self-correction abilities.

Conclusion: Current LLMs face a critical limitation in self-correction due to biases from training data. Addressing these gaps presents an opportunity to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

*Riccardo Cantini,Nicola Gabriele,Alessio Orsino,Domenico Talia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the impact of reasoning capabilities in language models on robustness to social biases, with findings suggesting that reasoning-enabled models may be more vulnerable to bias elicitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how reasoning capabilities, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and fine-tuned reasoning traces, in language models affect their robustness to social biases.

Method: The authors use the CLEAR-Bias benchmark with diverse sociocultural dimensions, LLM-as-a-judge safety scoring, and jailbreak techniques to assess the robustness and bias safety of reasoning language models.

Result: The study finds that models with reasoning capabilities are more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models, with CoT-prompted models being especially susceptible to contextual reframing attacks.

Conclusion: Reasoning does not inherently improve bias robustness, and there is a need for bias-aware reasoning design to mitigate vulnerabilities introduced by reasoning mechanisms.

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

TL;DR: This study introduces MathV-DP, a dataset with diverse solution paths for image-question pairs, and Qwen-VL-DP, a multimodal LLM trained to enhance reasoning diversity using supervised learning and reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current MLLMs that rely on single-solution supervision and fail to capture diverse valid reasoning perspectives in mathematical reasoning.

Method: The authors propose MathV-DP, a dataset that provides diverse reasoning trajectories, and develop Qwen-VL-DP, a model fine-tuned with supervised learning and enhanced with group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method designed to balance correctness and diversity.

Result: Qwen-VL-DP outperforms existing multimodal LLMs in accuracy and generative diversity, as demonstrated by experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse reasoning perspectives and reflective strategies into MLLMs significantly improves mathematical reasoning abilities, as shown by the enhanced performance of Qwen-VL-DP.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reveals that many medical questions can be handled without high-cost reasoning by large language models, proposing a dynamic routing system (SynapseRoute) to improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises to balance performance with operational costs in using large language models, especially between reasoning-intensive (thinking) and faster, cost-effective (non-thinking) modes.

Method: The proposed SynapseRoute system dynamically assigns queries to an appropriate mode based on their complexity, optimizing cost and accuracy. It combines a machine learning-based framework with experimental evaluation on medical datasets.

Result: SynapseRoute achieves better accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272), reduces inference time by 36.8%, and decreases token usage by 39.66% compared to standalone use of the thinking mode.

Conclusion: Dynamic routing systems like SynapseRoute enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and maintain or improve accuracy by assigning queries based on complexity. The introduction of the AIT index provides a robust metric for evaluating model performance trade-offs.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index

### [59] [Generalizing Verifiable Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02833)
*Valentina Pyatkin,Saumya Malik,Victoria Graf,Hamish Ivison,Shengyi Huang,Pradeep Dasigi,Nathan Lambert,Hannaneh Hajishirzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenge of improving language models' ability to precisely follow diverse user instructions and constraints. It introduces a new benchmark, IFBench, to assess generalization in adhering to unseen constraints and proposes reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as a promising training method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to enhance the interaction quality between humans and AI models by enabling the models to precisely follow user instructions, especially when those instructions contain specific output constraints. Current models are limited in their ability to generalize beyond familiar constraints.

Method: The paper introduces IFBench, a new benchmark comprising 58 challenging, out-of-domain constraints to evaluate models' ability to generalize in precise instruction following. It also develops constraint verification modules and employs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to train models to better adhere to constraints.

Result: The approach significantly improves instruction-following performance. The RLVR technique, combined with the new training data and verification functions, notably enhances generalization to unseen constraints compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that precise instruction following can be substantially improved through tailored benchmarks, verification modules, and RLVR as a training strategy. The release of IFBench, additional training data, and code contributes to advancing the field.

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

### [60] [LLM Hypnosis: Exploiting User Feedback for Unauthorized Knowledge Injection to All Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02850)
*Almog Hilel,Idan Shenfeld,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals a vulnerability where a single user can manipulate language models (LMs) trained with feedback by altering their knowledge and behavior using malicious prompts and feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate potential risks in language models' reliance on user feedback, focusing on how this feedback can be exploited for malicious purposes.

Method: The attackers manipulate LM outputs by upvoting 'poisoned' responses and downvoting benign ones, influencing LM behavior through preference tuning.

Result: The attack successfully modifies LM behavior, allowing perpetrators to insert new factual knowledge, introduce security vulnerabilities in code, and inject fake financial news.

Conclusion: This work highlights the risks of preference-tuned LMs being exploited and expands understanding of attack mechanisms and vulnerabilities in interactive AI systems.

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

### [61] [MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Fine-tuning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02851)
*Purbesh Mitra,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOTIF, a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to reason beyond their context size by using modular thinking via reinforcement finetuning, achieving performance gains with high sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are currently limited in their reasoning abilities by their context size, which constrains the number of tokens they can effectively analyze. Overcoming this limitation would allow LLMs to reason with greater depth and complexity.

Method: MOTIF, the proposed method, employs reinforcement learning finetuning to train LLMs to engage in modular thinking, allowing them to perform reasoning in multiple rounds. This was tested using the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model with efficiency-focused finetuning.

Result: The proposed MOTIF approach demonstrated improvements of 3.8% on the MATH500 benchmark and 3.3% on the AIME2024 benchmark over traditional GRPO training, with only 15% of training samples compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: MOTIF presents a novel, sample-efficient method to improve LLM reasoning beyond context size limitations, showing measurable success on established benchmarks while utilizing fewer training samples.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and
https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/MOTIF, respectively.

### [62] [Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02856)
*Nikhil Chandak,Shashwat Goel,Ameya Prabhu,Moritz Hardt,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multiple choice benchmarks for language model evaluation have limitations, as questions can sometimes be answered without seeing them. The paper proposes an alternative called 'answer matching,' where models generate free-form answers evaluated by another language model against reference answers, yielding better alignment with human judgment than multiple choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights a major shortcoming in the widely-used multiple choice benchmark methodology for assessing language models—questions can sometimes be answered without understanding the full context. The authors are motivated to find an evaluation method that better reflects human grading standards and avoids these shortcuts.

Method: The authors propose 'answer matching,' where a language model generates a free-form response to a question, and a modern language model evaluates this response's alignment with a reference answer. Validation involves datasets like MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond and measures alignment with human annotations.

Result: Answer matching demonstrates nearly perfect agreement with human grading, comparable to inter-annotator agreement. By contrast, traditional multiple choice evaluation and using large language models as judges without reference answers show poor alignment with human judgments.

Conclusion: The study suggests transitioning the evaluation methodology for language models from multiple choice benchmarks to answer matching, as it offers more accurate representation of human grading. This shift holds significant implications for how models are ranked and assessed.

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

*Zijie Cai,Christopher Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates monocular metric depth estimation in underwater environments and proposes fine-tuning on a synthetic underwater dataset to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth estimation models struggle in underwater environments due to light distortion, turbidity, and limited ground-truth metric data.

Method: The authors benchmark state-of-the-art models on underwater datasets and fine-tune Depth Anything V2 using a synthetic underwater Hypersim dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning significantly enhances the performance of the depth estimation model across multiple underwater conditions and outperforms other baselines.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for domain adaptation and scale-aware supervision for robust underwater depth estimation models.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

*Xiao Wang,Jingtao Jiang,Qiang Chen,Lan Chen,Lin Zhu,Yaowei Wang,Yonghong Tian,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ESTR-CoT, a novel event stream text recognition framework using a chain-of-thought reasoning approach, which improves interpretability and contextual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of low interpretability and weak contextual logical reasoning in event stream-based scene text recognition, especially in low illumination and fast-motion scenarios.

Method: The authors propose ESTR-CoT, which leverages EVA-CLIP as a vision encoder and Llama tokenizer to encode prompts. A Q-former aligns the vision tokens with the Vicuna-7B language model, enabling simultaneous output of answers and chain-of-thought reasoning. They also created a three-stage process for generating a large-scale CoT dataset.

Result: The framework demonstrated effectiveness and improved interpretability through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets: EventSTR, WordArt*, and IC15*.

Conclusion: The proposed ESTR-CoT framework advances the field by improving reasoning capabilities and interpretability for event stream scene text recognition.

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.

*Elena Ryumina,Maxim Markitantov,Alexandr Axyonov,Dmitry Ryumin,Mikhail Dolgushin,Alexey Karpov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers presented a zero-shot multimodal approach for recognizing compound emotional expressions (CER) using six heterogeneous modalities, achieving promising results comparable to supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of detecting complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic emotions, moving beyond traditional single-modality systems.

Method: A novel zero-shot multimodal pipeline was created, integrating six diverse modalities, with CLIP-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic understanding. It also introduced advanced probability and feature aggregation modules for better emotion interpretation.

Result: The approach achieved F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02% on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB during zero-shot testing, competing well with supervised methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively captures compound emotions without relying on domain-adapted supervised training, offering a robust alternative for CER using zero-shot techniques.

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciGA-145k, a dataset of 145,000 scientific papers and 1.14 million figures, to improve graphical abstract (GA) selection and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of limited adoption and underexplored potential of graphical abstracts in scientific communication, largely due to the advanced visualization skills required for their creation.

Method: The authors created a large-scale dataset (SciGA-145k) and defined two recommendation tasks: Intra-GA (selecting GAs from within a paper) and Inter-GA (retrieving GAs from other papers). They also introduced a new metric, CAR, for evaluating recommendation models.

Result: The paper provides baseline models for the defined tasks, and the novel CAR metric highlights a more nuanced performance analysis for GA selection.

Conclusion: This work lays a foundation for improving visual communication in science and developing AI tools to generate and recommend effective graphical abstracts.

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines synthetic data generation for robust object detectors using diffusion models and compares two conditioning schemes, achieving significant improvements in model precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting high-quality training data for industrial vision systems is slow and expensive, and synthetic data generation can help address this challenge.

Method: Researchers compare two conditioning strategies for diffusion models: prompt-based and layout-based conditioning, using eighty visual concepts from standard benchmarks.

Result: Synthetic data generated using layout conditioning raised mean average precision significantly, with improvements averaging 34% and peaking at 177% compared to using real data alone.

Conclusion: Diffusion models with appropriate conditioning schemes offer a promising solution for efficient synthetic data generation, bridging the gap between simulation and reality for object detection tasks.

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

*Tian Gao,Zhiyuan Zhang,Kaijie Yin,Xu-Cheng Zhong,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIDB-ViT, a binary vision transformer, improves performance by addressing issues of information loss and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the computational and storage demands of vision transformers while retaining performance on edge devices.

Method: The method involves creating a binary ViT with an informative attention module, frequency decomposition using discrete Haar wavelets, and an enhanced RPReLU activation function.

Result: DIDB-ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance in image classification and segmentation across various ViT architectures.

Conclusion: This paper presents a novel binary ViT that excels in efficiency and accuracy through tailored techniques to counteract binarization issues.

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of robots slowing down due to the low framerate of cameras and detection algorithms, which increases task execution time.

Method: Used FINN architecture to deploy three neural networks (MobileNet v1 with 4-bit quantization, CNV with 2-bit quantization, and CNV with 1-bit quantization) into FPGA hardware and trained these models on the open-access RG2C dataset.

Result: MobileNet v1 achieved a 98% success rate and an inference speed of 6611 FPS, outperforming the other models.

Conclusion: FPGAs can be effectively used to speed up Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), making them suitable for use in attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMOcc proposes a novel framework for few-frame 3D occupancy prediction, introducing a flow matching refinement and selective filtering for improved efficacy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in accurately predicting 3D semantic occupancies arise due to limited image frames and high redundancy in 3D space, especially in occluded and distant scenarios.

Method: Developed the FMOcc model featuring a Flow Matching SSM module for generating missing features. The Tri-perspective View (TPV) SSM layer and Plane Selective SSM (PS3M) limit redundancy by filtering air voxels. Additionally, a Mask Training method strengthens robustness in handling sensor data loss.

Result: FMOcc achieved state-of-the-art results on the Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets, with high RayIoU and mIoU scores and reasonable memory and inference time.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture demonstrates the ability to improve predictive accuracy and efficiency even in challenging few-frame scenarios, showing promise for advancing autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

*Zeyu Lei,Hongyuan Yu,Jinlin Wu,Zhen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgVisAgent is a multimodal large language model designed to address various surgical image distortions and perform enhancement tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical intervention enhancement algorithms are limited to single tasks and specific scenarios, which do not address complex, real-world surgical challenges.

Method: The paper introduces SurgVisAgent—leveraging multimodal large language models, a prior model for domain-specific knowledge, few-shot learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning to deliver dynamic image enhancement for varied distortion types and severities.

Result: Extensive experiments on a benchmark of simulated surgical distortions show that SurgVisAgent outperforms conventional single-task approaches.

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent represents a promising unified solution for surgical image enhancement that adapts dynamically to diverse distortion challenges, enhancing real-time surgical decision-making.

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion

that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference

*Yuxiang Zhang,Wei Li,Wen Jia,Mengmeng Zhang,Ran Tao,Shunlin Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA), a framework for cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, featuring domain adaptation techniques and a new transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address significant spectral shifts in hyperspectral images (HSIs) captured from different regions or times, which hampers effective classification.

Method: A triple-branch transformer architecture (source, target, and coupled branches) is used with a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention mechanism, bi-directional distillation loss, and Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy to extract domain-invariant and domain-specific features.

Result: The BiDA framework outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches by 3–5% in the cross-temporal tree species classification task and is validated on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: BiDA effectively enhances adaptability and separability in cross-domain HSI classification, offering a robust solution for spectral shift challenges in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater image enhancement is necessary for exploration since such images suffer from visibility and color issues caused by factors like light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.

Method: The authors propose the MAC-Lookup model, which integrates Conditional 3D Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for color correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement, while avoiding over-enhancement.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAC-Lookup restores details and colors in underwater images better than traditional and deep-learning-based methods.

Conclusion: The MAC-Lookup model effectively enhances underwater images by improving their visual quality and overcoming underwater-specific challenges.

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater
challenges. Extensive experiments show that MAC-Lookup excels in enhancing
underwater images by restoring details and colors better than existing methods.

*Feizhen Huang,Yu Wu,Yutian Lin,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-distillation approach to improve Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation by incorporating cinematic language elements, addressing challenges with partial visual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A methods fail in scenarios with partial visibility due to lack of consideration for cinematic language, which is crucial in artistic video production.

Method: The method uses self-distillation to simulate cinematic language variations, enabling a student model to learn from video-audio correspondences and align video features even with partial visibility.

Result: The proposed approach achieves better performance under conditions of partial visibility and improves results on the VGGSound dataset across all metrics.

Conclusion: Incorporating cinematic language into V2A models using self-distillation effectively enhances their ability to handle partial visual information while improving overall dataset performance.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

*Juntao Liu,Liqiang Niu,Wenchao Chen,Jie Zhou,Fandong Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LaCo, a method for compressing visual tokens within the intermediate layers of vision encoders in multimodal large language models, resulting in better efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for visual token compression in MLLMs focus on post-encoder modules, which restrict efficiency improvements. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by enabling token compression during intermediate encoding stages.

Method: LaCo employs a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism for spatial-to-channel token merging and a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts to retain vital visual information during compression.

Result: LaCo demonstrates superior effectiveness, surpassing existing methods in compressing intermediate vision encoder layers. It enhances training efficiency by more than 20% and inference throughput by over 15%, sustaining robust performance.

Conclusion: Integrating visual token compression into intermediate layers provides performance and efficiency benefits in MLLMs, with LaCo showing notable advancements compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

*De Cheng,Zhipeng Xu,Xinyang Jiang,Dongsheng Li,Nannan Wang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework leveraging controllable language prompts to improve generalization in unseen domains, supplemented with augmented abstract prompts and alignment constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) like CLIP for domain generalization (DG), designing effective prompts to extract invariant features across domains remains challenging.

Method: A new framework uses large language models to disentangle text prompts, guiding domain-invariant visual feature learning. It incorporates Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA) with abstract prompts and stylized image augmentations to improve robustness.

Result: The method achieved superior performance over state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques across multiple datasets such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc.

Conclusion: The framework effectively overcomes existing limitations by combining text-guided visual prompts with augmentation strategies, improving generalization on unseen domains.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViRefSAM, a framework that enhances the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for effective segmentation in remote sensing images by eliminating manual prompts and improving domain adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in applying SAM to remote sensing images, such as the need for manual prompts and lack of adaptability to remote sensing-specific semantics.

Method: ViRefSAM uses a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder to guide semantic extraction and a Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter to mitigate domain gaps, enabling SAM to perform class-specific segmentation automatically.

Result: ViRefSAM shows robust few-shot segmentation performance across unseen classes with substantial improvements over existing methods in benchmarks like iSAID-5$^i$, LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$.

Conclusion: ViRefSAM successfully adapts SAM for remote sensing segmentation tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy without manual prompting.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: DreamComposer++ improves view-aware 2D diffusion models by enabling control in novel view generation using multi-view conditions and 3D representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D diffusion models struggle with controllable novel view generation due to limitations associated with single-view input.

Method: DreamComposer++ utilizes a 3D lifting module to extract object representations from various views, then fuses and integrates them into pre-trained diffusion models for view synthesis.

Result: The proposed framework enhances the controllability and quality of novel view generation in existing diffusion models.

Conclusion: DreamComposer++ effectively addresses the challenges of controllable view generation, offering advancements in 3D object reconstruction and expanding application possibilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flow-CDNet, a network for detecting both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images using two branches (optical flow and binary detection), supported by a novel dataset and evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow changes in bitemporal images can act as precursors to significant hazards in real-life situations, but existing change detection methods mostly focus on fast changes.

Method: The proposed method, Flow-CDNet, has two branches: an optical flow branch using a pyramid structure for displacement changes and a ResNet-based branch for binary change detection. A new dataset, loss function, and evaluation metric were created.

Result: Experiments on the Flow-Change dataset showed that Flow-CDNet outperformed other methods. Ablation studies confirmed that the two branches mutually enhance detection performance.

Conclusion: The two-branch approach of Flow-CDNet effectively detects both slow and fast changes, proving its potential value in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

*Pei Guo,Ryan Farrell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LMPNet, a method for semantic object keypoint discovery using weak supervision via category labels, involving novel techniques like a leaky max pooling layer and learnable clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for semantic object keypoint discovery that is weakly supervised by category labels, eliminating the need for extensive supervision.

Method: The authors propose LMPNet, which transforms intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. Key components include a leaky max pooling layer for learning non-repeatable local patterns, a visualized filter selection strategy for consistency, and a clustering layer for grouping keypoint predictions.

Result: LMPNet automatically discovers semantic object keypoints that are robust to pose variations and achieves comparable accuracy to supervised pose estimation methods.

Conclusion: LMPNet offers a weakly-supervised, interpretable approach for semantic keypoint discovery, relying on manipulating network filters to detect predefined concepts effectively.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of fMRI signals to improve object detection and segmentation by infusing them via cross-attention into features, demonstrating enriched semantic cues and localization abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current brain-vision decoding models which lack fine-grained semantic alignment for multi-object reconstruction.

Method: An experimental framework injects fMRI signals using cross-attention into multi-scale image feature spaces, comparing their impact on object detection and instance segmentation tasks.

Result: Incorporating fMRI representations significantly improved detection and segmentation accuracy, proving the presence of valuable semantic and spatial data within neural signals.

Conclusion: Current decoding models could better exploit fMRI signals to enhance semantic understanding and spatial localization in visual tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

*JaeHyuck Choi,MinJun Kim,JeHyeong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAGIC, a few-shot anomaly generator addressing background corruption, mask misplacement, and diversity loss in anomaly data generation for industrial quality control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of anomaly data in industrial settings necessitates effective anomaly generation methods that maintain background integrity, follow mask guidance, and generate diverse and realistic results.

Method: MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting backbone, adds Gaussian prompt-level perturbations and mask-guided spatial noise injection, and incorporates context-aware mask alignment to ensure realistic and semantically valid anomaly generation.

Result: MAGIC surpassed previous methods in anomaly detection and generation tasks on the MVTec-AD dataset.

Conclusion: MAGIC effectively addresses key challenges in anomaly generation, improving quality and diversity of artificially-created data for industrial applications.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SynTVA, a new benchmark dataset to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos in downstream tasks like text-to-video retrieval (TVR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for text-to-video synthesis overly focus on visual quality and temporal consistency, providing inadequate insights into performance for TVR tasks.

Method: SynTVA benchmarks synthetic videos based on semantic alignment scores across multiple dimensions (Object & Scene, Action, Attribute, Prompt Fidelity), using correlation with general Video Quality Assessment metrics. The study also develops an Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics.

Result: SynTVA demonstrates that synthetic videos can augment datasets effectively, selecting high-utility samples that improve TVR model performance.

Conclusion: SynTVA serves as a robust tool for assessing and leveraging synthetic video quality, significantly aiding downstream retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

Motivation: To enable robots with dexterous human-like hands to perform functional grasping aligned with language instructions, overcoming limitations in current research focused on simple gripper end-effectors.

Method: The authors created DexGraspNet 3.0, a dataset containing 170 million simulated dexterous grasp poses and detailed captions, used to train a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and a flow-matching-based pose prediction head for producing accurate, instruction-aligned grasps.

Result: DexVLG achieved over 76% zero-shot execution success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulations, as well as successful results in real-world grasping experiments.

Conclusion: DexVLG demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization capabilities, bridging the gap between human-like dexterous manipulation and natural language instructions.

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

Method: InnerControl trains convolutional probes to reconstruct input control signals at every denoising step and minimizes discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the diffusion process.

Result: InnerControl improves control fidelity and generation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple conditioning methods when combined with ControlNet++.

Conclusion: InnerControl provides a more robust solution for spatial control in diffusion models by enhancing consistency across the entire generation process.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

TL;DR: This paper compares two approaches for detecting rice leaf diseases, revealing superior results for the Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) over a Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the need for early detection of rice leaf diseases to mitigate productivity losses and improve economic outcomes in rice farming.

Method: The research contrasts FADM with DICDM using Feature Extraction Algorithms, Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms, Feature Selection Algorithms, and Extreme Learning Machine, validated with 10-fold Cross-Validation on a dataset of various rice leaf conditions.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that FADM achieves the highest classification performance for rice leaf diseases compared to DICDM.

Conclusion: The proposed FADM approach offers a compelling solution for enhancing crop health, improving yield, and promoting sustainable rice farming practices.

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study presents an automated method using neural networks for detecting critical Circle of Willis bifurcations crucial for intracranial aneurysm diagnosis, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate accurate and efficient diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms by addressing challenges in detecting critical arterial bifurcations within the anatomical variability of the Circle of Willis.

Method: A two-step neural network approach: an object detection network first identifies regions of interest near bifurcations, followed by a modified U-Net with deep supervision for precise landmark localization.

Result: The method demonstrated superior performance in bifurcation detection tasks across two datasets, including an in-house dataset with varying landmark counts and a public dataset with standardized configurations.

Conclusion: This technique effectively reduces missed detections caused by spatial or visual proximity of landmarks and accounts for anatomical variability, offering a robust solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight detection model is proposed to identify shrimp diseases effectively, improving accuracy and efficiency over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shrimp diseases significantly impact the aquaculture economy, necessitating intelligent and efficient detection systems to minimize losses.

Method: The paper introduces a modified YOLOv8n framework by developing the RLDD detection head, C2f-EMCM module, and SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism, optimizing accuracy and computation.

Result: The proposed model reduces parameters by 32.3% with a mAP@0.5 of 92.7%, outperforming YOLOv8n and other lightweight YOLO models in accuracy, parameter count, and size, while proving robustness on an external dataset.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical solution for accurate and efficient shrimp disease detection, with balanced technical performance and applicability in aquaculture.

Abstract: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network
architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and
C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining
detection accuracy, improving computational efficiency. Subsequently, an
improved SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism is introduced to further
enhance the model's feature extraction capability, enabling more precise
identification of disease characteristics. Extensive experiments, including
ablation studies and comparative evaluations, are conducted on a
self-constructed shrimp disease dataset, with generalization tests extended to
the URPC2020 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5
of 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms
other lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model
size. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the
model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The
proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,
providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in
shrimp aquaculture.

### [91] [Holistic Tokenizer for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02358)
*Anlin Zheng,Haochen Wang,Yucheng Zhao,Weipeng Deng,Tiancai Wang,Xiangyu Zhang,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hita, a novel image tokenizer aimed at improving autoregressive (AR) image generation by employing a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme and causal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla autoregressive models for image generation struggle with capturing holistic relationships between tokens and mainly rely on visual tokenizers that focus on local patches, which don't encapsulate global information effectively.

Method: Hita proposes a holistic-to-local tokenization approach, using learnable holistic queries followed by sequential local patch tokens. It employs causal attention between tokens and a lightweight fusion module to prioritize holistic tokens during decoding.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that models using Hita outperform those using vanilla tokenizers, achieving significant improvements in FID (2.59) and IS (281.9) on the ImageNet benchmark, while excelling in global image attribute capture and tasks like zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Conclusion: Hita enhances AR image generation by integrating holistic and local features more effectively, accelerating training and improving generation quality, showcasing potential for broader image applications.

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LocalDyGS models dynamic real-world scenes by decomposing them into local spaces and separating static and dynamic features, achieving better realism in fine-scale and large-scale motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous methods that struggle with complex dynamic motions in real-world videos.

Method: The paper introduces LocalDyGS, which splits a dynamic scene into local spaces using seeds and separates static and dynamic features to model motion.

Result: LocalDyGS shows competitive results against SOTA methods for fine-scale datasets and innovatively tackles larger, complex motions.

Conclusion: LocalDyGS provides a novel framework to improve realistic reconstruction of highly dynamic scenes using its local space and feature decomposition approach.

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

*Xizhe Xue,Yang Zhou,Dawei Yan,Ying Li,Haokui Zhang,Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents UVLM, an underwater observation benchmark constructed with AI and human expertise, addressing the unique challenges of underwater environments and filling a gap in the application of video language models (VidLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the lack of attention given to underwater scenarios in research surrounding video language models, despite their importance for underwater observation applications.

Method: The authors created UVLM by selecting videos representing unique underwater challenges, ensuring data diversity across frame rates, resolutions, and a variety of marine and environmental classes. They also categorized observation tasks into biological and environmental for structured analysis and designed evaluation metrics.

Result: Fine-tuning existing VidLMs on UVLM improves understanding of underwater environments and shows slight performance gains in above-water video benchmarks like VideoMME and Perception text.

Conclusion: UVLM is a significant step forward in addressing underwater AI needs, enriching VidLM capabilities, and will be made publicly available for further research progress.

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pseudo-labeling framework for monocular 3D object detection using video data to address challenges of data scarcity and 2D-to-3D ambiguity without multi-view setups or extra sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of data scarcity, high annotation costs, and 2D-to-3D ambiguity in Monocular 3D Object Detection (M3OD).

Method: A novel pseudo-labeling framework that aggregates pseudo-LiDARs from temporally adjacent frames using object point tracking for both static and dynamic objects.

Result: Extensive experiments showcase reliable accuracy and strong scalability of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The method is practical and effective for M3OD, bypassing the need for additional resources like sensors or camera poses while being robust to occlusions.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

### [95] [Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization for Histopathological Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02395)
*Byung Hyun Lee,Wongi Jeong,Woojae Han,Kyoungbun Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoMEL, a framework for continual multiple instance learning that addresses localization and adaptability challenges while mitigating forgetting. It achieves improved accuracy in experiments on histopathological images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address problems in continual multiple instance learning (MIL) for large-scale images, specifically in instance-level localization with minimal forgetting, since existing methods are designed for natural images and not suitable for scenarios like histopathological WSIs.

Method: CoMEL incorporates three components: (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for pseudo-label generation, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting.

Result: Experiments on three public whole slide image datasets show that CoMEL outperforms prior methods, achieving up to 11.00% improvement in bag-level accuracy and 23.4% improvement in localization accuracy in continual MIL tasks.

Conclusion: CoMEL is effective in addressing the challenges of continual MIL, demonstrating superiority in both performance and adaptability for instance localization in histopathological images.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

*Taehoon Kim,Jongwook Choi,Yonghyun Jeong,Haeun Noh,Jaejun Yoo,Seungryul Baek,Jongwon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a deepfake video detection method using pixel-wise temporal analysis, addressing limitations of traditional spatial frequency methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While traditional detectors focus on spatial frequency and ignore pixel-level temporal inconsistencies, this paper aims to improve deepfake detection by targeting these overlooked temporal artifacts.

Method: The method involves applying a 1D Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, coupled with an attention proposal module for locating temporal artifacts and a joint transformer module for integrating temporal and spatio-temporal features.

Result: The proposed framework enhances the ability to detect deepfake videos, offering robust performance across various challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach sets a new benchmark in deepfake detection by addressing temporal inconsistencies in videos, an area overlooked by earlier methods.

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

*Peilin Zhang,Shaouxan Wua,Jun Feng,Zhuo Jin,Zhizezhang Gao,Jingkun Chen,Yaqiong Xing,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAB Net, a weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework utilizing scribble annotations to reduce annotation costs while maintaining performance close to that of fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully annotated medical image datasets are expensive and time-consuming to create, prompting the need for efficient and sparse labeling techniques, such as scribble annotations, for segmentation tasks.

Method: TAB Net combines two innovative modules: (1) Triplet Augmentation Self-recovery (TAS), which employs three data augmentation techniques to recover features and provide a robust semantic understanding, and (2) Boundary-aware Pseudo-label Supervision (BAP), which integrates dual-branch predictions and a boundary-aware loss to sharpen segmentation results.

Result: The proposed TAB Net achieves notable success on public datasets (ACDC and MSCMR seg), surpassing existing weakly-supervised methods and rivaling fully supervised approaches in performance.

Conclusion: TAB Net addresses the limitation of sparse scribble annotations by effectively enhancing feature learning and boundary supervision, offering a practical and high-performing solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using self-supervised learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification by leveraging temporal image pairs from camera trap data, showing SSL outperforms supervised models in robustness and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address reliance on annotated data in current state-of-the-art wildlife re-identification models, which limits scalability and broad application.

Method: The authors use camera trap data to automatically extract temporal image pairs as distinct views of an individual, enabling self-supervised learning without supervision. The learned representations are evaluated on open-world scenarios and wildlife downstream tasks.

Result: The experimental analysis demonstrates that self-supervised models are more robust with limited data and outperform supervised models across various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning provides a scalable and effective solution for wildlife re-identification, eliminating the need for extensive labeled datasets while delivering superior performance.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

TL;DR: The paper integrates diffusion models with auto-encoders to enable image-specific semantic representation, focusing on latent space structuring and unsupervised artifact restoration techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of image-specific semantic representation in diffusion models by combining them with auto-encoders, enabling a structured latent space for tasks like artifact restoration and tissue differentiation.

Method: The method involves coupling an encoder with a diffusion model to structure latent spaces for specific applications. This includes using latent representations for brain tissue differentiation and unsupervised artifact restoration techniques for tear artifacts and JPEG artifacts.

Result: The approach effectively structured the latent space for brain tissue differentiation. It also demonstrated success in unsupervised restoration of tear artifacts using neighborhood awareness, and unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration.

Conclusion: Integrating auto-encoding and diffusion models creates structured and application-specific latent spaces, enhancing capabilities for tasks like artifact restoration and tissue-analysis in images.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty of detecting and tracking pedestrians in thermal images due to their low-level feature representation.

Method: A novel two-stage tuning framework is proposed, optimizing hyperparameters in both stages to enhance real-time tracking in thermal imagery.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy without relying on complex reidentification or motion models, as shown by experiments on the PBVS Thermal MOT dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective and robust for pedestrian tracking in thermal imagery, making it suitable for real-world surveillance.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

Result: The PFIP method achieved a 100% hit rate and retrieved 1,000 ciphertext face templates in under 300 milliseconds, marking almost a 50x efficiency improvement over existing approaches.

Conclusion: PFIP effectively balances privacy preservation, accuracy, and retrieval speed, offering a significant advancement for secure face identification systems in large-scale applications.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

*Subhasis Dasgupta,Jaydip Sen,Tuhina Halder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep-learning-based ensemble model for structural crack detection, outperforming traditional models in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in manual crack detection, such as slow processes, inconsistency, and human error, by designing a more reliable and efficient system.

Method: The researchers utilized multiple residual U-Net configurations and integrated them into an ensemble model with a meta-model containing convolutional blocks, benchmarking it against SegNet and traditional U-Net.

Result: Residual U-Nets outperformed traditional models in detecting cracks, especially with low-resolution images, while the ensemble model achieved the highest IoU and DICE scores, indicating superior predictive performance.

Conclusion: The developed ensemble model demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing the automation and accuracy of structural defect monitoring tasks, contributing to safer and more efficient infrastructure management.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

### [103] [AvatarMakeup: Realistic Makeup Transfer for 3D Animatable Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02419)
*Yiming Zhong,Xiaolin Zhang,Ligang Liu,Yao Zhao,Yunchao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarMakeup enables realistic 3D makeup transfer for avatars, ensuring consistent appearance, identity preservation, and high-quality details using a pretrained diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian editing methods do not fulfill the requirements for realistic makeup effects in virtual avatars, such as consistency during expressions, identity preservation, and fine-detail control.

Method: The paper proposes AvatarMakeup, a 3D makeup transfer method that uses a pretrained diffusion model. It features Coherent Duplication for consistency and a Refinement Module for detailed enhancements.

Result: AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art results in makeup transfer, maintaining high quality and consistency across dynamic animations.

Conclusion: The approach effectively personalizes avatar makeup while overcoming challenges of appearance consistency, identity preservation, and fine detail control during dynamic expressions.

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

*Wei Li,Jingyang Zhang,Lihao Liu,Guoan Wang,Junjun He,Yang Chen,Lixu Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) for domain fragment data with unpredictable shifts is addressed via the I-DiPT framework, achieving superior results in medical classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the practical challenge in clinical settings where test data arrives as domain fragments of varying lengths and in random order, making typical TTA models unsuitable.

Method: The proposed method, I-DiPT, includes image-invariant and image-specific prompts for domain-invariant and individual adaptation, respectively. It employs Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM) for efficient learning from images and Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD) for leveraging historical knowledge.

Result: The method outperformed existing TTA approaches in breast cancer and glaucoma classification tasks by successfully adapting to fragmentary and unpredictable domain shifts.

Conclusion: I-DiPT effectively addresses the challenge of Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation by leveraging innovative methods to adapt a source model to domain fragments, with superior performance demonstrated in experimental results.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

### [105] [IGDNet: Zero-Shot Robust Underexposed Image Enhancement via Illumination-Guided and Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02445)
*Hailong Yan,Junjian Huang,Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGDNet is a zero-shot image enhancement method that restores underexposed images using a single test image, without training data or guiding priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on paired datasets for training, which are impractical to collect, and they often lead to over-enhancement issues.

Method: IGDNet employs a decomposition module for separating illumination and reflection components, and a denoising module for adaptive correction of illumination, without requiring external priors.

Result: IGDNet outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods on metrics like PSNR (20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) across four public datasets.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong generalization and effectively enhances underexposed images while suppressing noise, offering a practical solution for varied lighting conditions.

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

### [106] [Weakly-supervised Contrastive Learning with Quantity Prompts for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02454)
*Weiwei Duan,Luping Ji,Shengjia Chen,Sicheng Zhu,Jianghong Huang,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a weakly-supervised contrastive learning framework for moving infrared small target detection, reducing the need for costly manual annotations while achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting small, moving targets in infrared images is challenging due to their tiny size and weak contrast with the background, compounded by the high cost of manual annotations for video sequences.

Method: The proposed weakly-supervised scheme, WeCoL, uses target quantity prompts, the SAM pretrained model for target mining, contrastive learning for pseudo-label reliability, and motion-aware learning to capture both local and global motion patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments on DAUB and ITSDT-15K datasets demonstrate that WeCoL often outperforms early fully-supervised methods and achieves over 90% of the performance of state-of-the-art fully-supervised approaches.

Conclusion: The weakly-supervised WeCoL framework effectively reduces annotation requirements while maintaining competitive performance, demonstrating its potential as a more efficient alternative to fully-supervised methods.

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh Silksong introduces an efficient method for polygon mesh representation, reducing token redundancy by 50% and improving geometric properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh tokenization approaches produce redundant vertex tokens, wasting computational efficiency and network capability.

Method: Mesh Silksong tokenizes each mesh vertex only once, creating a compact sequence and addressing redundancy issues in mesh representation.

Result: The method achieves a state-of-the-art compression rate (~22%) and produces meshes with enhanced geometric integrity, including watertight detection and manifold topology.

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong demonstrates superior mesh generation efficiency and practical geometric improvements, with promising potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

*Xiangfeng Wang,Xiao Li,Yadong Wei,Xueyu Song,Yang Song,Xiaoqiang Xia,Fangrui Zeng,Zaiyi Chen,Liu Liu,Gu Xu,Tong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "HIVE," a human-inspired multimodal video editing framework, to create concise and coherent video clips. It outperforms existing methods and introduces a new dataset for further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for efficient video editing arises from the rapid growth of online video content, particularly on short video platforms. Current methods often produce incoherent outputs by neglecting rich visual context, leading to the need for a more holistic multimodal approach.

Method: The proposed framework, HIVE, utilizes multimodal narrative understanding through character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization. It decomposes video editing into highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and content pruning, enhanced by scene-level segmentation.

Result: HIVE consistently outperforms baseline methods in both general and advertisement-oriented video editing tasks. Experimental results show significant improvements, bridging the quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Conclusion: HIVE demonstrates the potential of multimodal large language models for video editing and sets a new standard with the introduction of the DramaAD benchmark dataset. This facilitates further research and advancements in automated video editing.

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

### [109] [CrowdTrack: A Benchmark for Difficult Multiple Pedestrian Tracking in Real Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02479)
*Teng Fu,Yuwen Chen,Zhuofan Chen,Mengyang Zhao,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the large-scale multi-pedestrian tracking dataset called 'CrowdTrack,' featuring real-life complex scenarios with 33 videos and 5,185 annotated object trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-object tracking methods struggle in complex scenarios due to limitations in motion and appearance information, and current datasets are inadequate in terms of complexity and realism.

Method: The authors developed 'CrowdTrack,' a large-scale multi-pedestrian tracking dataset with videos shot from first-person views in real-life complex scenarios, with detailed annotations including bounding boxes and unique object IDs.

Result: The dataset includes comprehensive performance evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and foundation models, demonstrating its utility in challenging tracking scenarios.

Conclusion: CrowdTrack is a challenging and realistic dataset that can advance the development of robust multi-pedestrian tracking algorithms in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

*Zunhui Xia,Hongxing Li,Libin Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedFormer is a novel medical vision transformer designed to address challenges in medical image recognition by combining a pyramid scaling structure and a Dual Sparse Selection Attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the task-specific limitations and high computational overhead of existing vision transformer-based methods in medical image recognition, enabling more generality and efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces MedFormer, which incorporates a pyramid scaling structure for hierarchical feature representation and reduced computation, as well as a Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) mechanism for content-aware sparse attention, improving efficiency and robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate MedFormer's superior performance across medical image classification, semantic segmentation, and lesion detection, showing both generality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: MedFormer improves computational efficiency and robustness while achieving high performance across diverse medical image recognition tasks. The method shows promise as a scalable and versatile tool for medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel supervised contrastive loss approach and temporal adjacency constraints for automated polyp counting in colonoscopy, achieving significant improvement and establishing a new state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the cost-effectiveness and quality of colonoscopy screening by developing a more robust and precise approach for polyp counting that accounts for both visual and temporal factors.

Method: The authors introduce supervised contrastive loss with temporally-aware soft targets to improve intra-polyp variability and inter-polyp discriminability. They also integrate a temporal adjacency constraint for better clustering of polyp tracklets.

Result: Using publicly available datasets and a leave-one-out cross-validation, their method achieves a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to previous approaches, establishing a new benchmark.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of temporal awareness in automated polyp counting systems, presenting a robust solution that outperforms existing methodologies and contributes to automated procedure reporting.

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisCo, a visual-centric attack method to exploit security vulnerabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), achieving significantly higher attack success rates compared to existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the security vulnerabilities of multimodal large language models in open-world environments, specifically through visual-centric jailbreaks which leverage the visual modality as an integral part of realistic scenarios.

Method: The authors propose the VisCo Attack, which uses four visual-focused strategies to construct jailbreak scenarios, generates auxiliary images dynamically, and refines prompts with automatic toxicity obfuscation and semantic enhancement.

Result: VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 85% on the MM-SafetyBench dataset against GPT-4o, outperforming the baseline with a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%.

Conclusion: VisCo demonstrates the efficacy of leveraging visual-centric approaches to compromise MLLMs, significantly improving attack success rates and raising awareness of vulnerabilities inherent in current systems.

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

TL;DR: MC-INR is a new framework that enhances Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to flexibly encode multivariate data on unstructured grids using meta-learning, clustering, and dynamic mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INR methods struggle with encoding complex structures, handling multivariate data, and working on unstructured grids, especially when applied to real-world scientific datasets.

Method: MC-INR integrates meta-learning and clustering for flexibility, employs a residual-based re-clustering mechanism to adaptively partition data, and uses a branched layer for simultaneous multivariate data processing.

Result: Experimental results show that MC-INR achieves superior performance in encoding scientific simulation data compared to existing INR approaches.

Conclusion: MC-INR addresses key limitations of traditional INR methods, offering a robust solution for encoding complex multivariate data on unstructured grids.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of pedestrian detection in low-light conditions using RGB cameras, which is crucial for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems.

Method: The method involves infrared detection with a fine-tuned model, label transfer from infrared to RGB, and training object detection models using the generated labels.

Result: Models trained on generated labels outperformed models trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases on mAP metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed infrared-RGB labeling approach shows promise in enhancing low-light pedestrian detection and provides a publicly available implementation for further exploration.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling

fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and

Abstract: India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in
agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and
environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases
across different crops are critical for improving yield and ensuring food
security. This paper proposes a deep learning based solution for detecting
multiple diseases in multiple crops, aimed to cover India's diverse
agricultural landscape. We first create a unified dataset encompassing images
of 17 different crops and 34 different diseases from various available
repositories. Proposed deep learning model is trained on this dataset and
outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops,
diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed
solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP
demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological
analysis, enhancing the efficiency of genetic selection and contributing to
more sustainable aquaculture practices.The code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents MoGe-2, an enhanced model that estimates metric-scale 3D geometry from a single image, combining advancements in scale prediction, data refinement, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in geometry estimation models which struggle to predict metric geometry and maintain detail due to noise in real-world data.

Method: MoGe-2 extends MoGe by enabling metric scale prediction and employs a unified data refinement approach to enhance detail and accuracy using mixed datasets.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations show MoGe-2 achieves improved relative geometry accuracy, precise metric scale prediction, and detailed 3D reconstructions, surpassing prior methods.

Conclusion: MoGe-2 sets a new benchmark in open-domain geometry estimation, resolving prior challenges with an effective combination of relative geometry and metric scale accuracy alongside fine-grained detail.

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

*Buzhen Huang,Chen Li,Chongyang Xu,Dongyue Lu,Jinnan Chen,Yangang Wang,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve human pose estimation in videos with visual ambiguities and occlusions by using human appearance as a cue, trained diffusion models, and dual-branch optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods and even state-of-the-art large foundation models struggle to recover plausible human interactions under visual ambiguities and occlusions in in-the-wild videos.

Method: A dual-branch optimization framework is proposed that integrates a trained diffusion model for human proxemics and pose priors with optimizable tensors. Additional constraints such as 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetration are applied to enhance the optimization process.

Result: The method successfully estimates accurate interactions from complex, in-the-wild video environments and demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of leveraging human appearance cues, proxemics priors, and optimization frameworks to enhance pose estimation and interaction reconstruction. The work also provides a new dataset to foster further research in this field.

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that unifies voxel, mesh, and parametric representations of vessels using differentiable transformations, enabling smooth and accurate modeling of complex vascular geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disjointed use of voxel, mesh, and parametric representations of vessels, which limits their potential in applications requiring smoothness, accuracy, and transformation among forms.

Method: The researchers developed a differentiable framework combining three vessel representations (voxel, mesh, parametric) by extracting parametric models using centerlines and cubic B-splines, and generating meshes differentiably from these parameters.

Result: The method accurately captured the geometry of complex vasculatures. This success was demonstrated on aortas, aneurysms, and brain vessels, showcasing highly accurate volumetric fits.

Conclusion: This framework enables seamless transitions between vessel representations while improving modeling accuracy and maintaining smoothness, proving its practical utility in medical and biological modeling applications.

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel 3D medical image self-supervised learning framework called $S^2DC$ to address anatomical structure variations, achieving superior performance across multiple datasets and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mSSL methods fail to account for anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology, which are key for capturing meaningful distinctions.

Method: The proposed $S^2DC$ framework uses an optimal transport strategy to enforce semantic discrepancy and advances semantic consistency using neighborhood similarity distribution, bridging patch-level and structure-level representations.

Result: $S^2DC$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mSSL methods across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3 modalities.

Conclusion: The $S^2DC$ framework effectively learns structure-aware representations, enabling better medical analysis by addressing anatomical structure variations.

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AuroraLong, which replaces transformer-based language models with a linear RNN model for efficient long video understanding, maintaining performance while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based LLMs face challenges with long video understanding due to high memory and computational demands that scale quadratically with sequence length.

Method: The authors propose AuroraLong, which uses a linear RNN model with constant-size hidden states for arbitrary-length input. It also combines token merging and reordering techniques for increased efficiency.

Result: AuroraLong, with only 2B parameters trained on public data, achieves comparable performance to transformer-based models of similar size trained on private datasets across various video benchmarks.

Conclusion: AuroraLong demonstrates the potential of linear RNNs for long video understanding, lowering computational barriers and democratizing the field.

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the lack of faulty image datasets in Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) for space missions by simulating fault scenarios to train AI fault detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Based Navigation in space missions faces reliability and robustness issues due to potential sensor faults. Current fault detection methods have limitations that AI could address, but a lack of faulty image datasets restricts this adoption.

Method: The study systematically analyzes camera sensor faults in interplanetary missions, their impacts, and existing mitigations. It introduces a simulation framework for generating faulty images and creates a dataset for AI fault detection training.

Result: A fault-injection simulation framework was developed, and a synthetic dataset of faulty images was produced for testing and training AI fault detection algorithms in VBN systems.

Conclusion: By creating a synthetic dataset of faulty images, this study provides a valuable resource for enhancing AI-based fault detection in Vision-Based Navigation systems relevant to space missions.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues in AI-generated image (AIGI) detection by introducing the Holmes-Set dataset and Holmes Pipeline model, enhancing generalization and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in detecting AI-generated images (lack of human-verifiable explanations and poor generalization to newer technologies), which impact public information security.

Method: The authors introduce the Holmes-Set dataset with structured explanation-rich annotations and propose the Holmes Pipeline, a three-stage training framework (pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization) tailored for multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

Result: The introduction of Holmes-Set and the Holmes Pipeline showed improved performance and generalization in AIGI detection, verified through extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Holmes-Set and Holmes Pipeline demonstrate effectiveness in detecting AI-generated images, offering human-verifiable and human-aligned explanations while addressing generalization issues.

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework combining deep unfolding and model distillation to transform diffusion models into efficient posterior sampling tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing diffusion model methods, namely the flexibility but approximation issues of Plug-and-Play methods and the specificity of conditional DMs.

Method: The approach unfolds an MCMC algorithm (LATINO Langevin sampler) to achieve efficient posterior sampling via deep unfolding and model distillation.

Result: The unfolded and distilled samplers showed excellent accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability in experiments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a novel and effective way to utilize DM image priors for Bayesian computational imaging with competitive performance and flexibility.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Personalized Training (APT), a new framework that addresses overfitting, prior knowledge loss, and text alignment degradation in personalizing diffusion models with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of personalizing diffusion models using limited data, particularly overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of semantic coherence.

Method: The proposed APT framework includes three components: (1) Adaptive Training Adjustment to dynamically address overfitting through indicators and adaptive strategies, (2) Representation Stabilization to regularize intermediate feature maps, and (3) Attention Alignment to maintain prior knowledge by aligning cross-attention maps with pretrained models.

Result: APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior knowledge, and generates high-quality, diverse images with limited reference data, outperforming existing methods in related experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed APT framework successfully addresses personalizing diffusion models under limited data constraints, offering a balanced solution to retain coherence and prior knowledge.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

*Xiangyang Luo,Ye Zhu,Yunfei Liu,Lijian Lin,Cong Wan,Zijian Cai,Shao-Lun Huang,Yu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CanonSwap is introduced as a novel video face-swapping framework that addresses the challenge of preserving both source identity and target face dynamics using a decoupling approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video face-swapping methods struggle to maintain both high-quality identity transfers and the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as facial expressions and head poses, due to the coupling of appearance and motion information.

Method: CanonSwap decouples motion and appearance information by first removing motion-related details, performing identity modification in a canonical space, and reintroducing the modified features back to the video. It uses a Partial Identity Modulation module with a spatial mask for precise identity transfer, ensuring minimal artifacts.

Result: CanonSwap significantly outperforms other methods in preserving visual quality, temporal consistency, and identity fidelity according to both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Through its innovative architecture and evaluation metrics, CanonSwap effectively overcomes prior limitations, offering consistent and high-quality video face swapping while preserving dynamic attributes of the target video.

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIU3R, an alignment-free framework for simultaneous 3D reconstruction and understanding from unposed images, overcoming limitations of previous approaches reliant on 2D-to-3D feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of 2D-to-3D feature alignment in simultaneous 3D reconstruction and understanding, such as limited 3D understanding capabilities and semantic information loss.

Method: SIU3R uses a pixel-aligned 3D representation and introduces unified learnable queries for 3D understanding without requiring 2D model alignment. It also includes two lightweight modules to enhance interaction between reconstruction and understanding tasks.

Result: SIU3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in both 3D reconstruction and understanding tasks, as well as their simultaneous execution, demonstrating its advantages over prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed alignment-free framework offers native 3D understanding and improved task collaboration, providing effective solutions for simultaneous 3D reconstruction and understanding.

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in keypoint-guided text-to-image generation, introducing the UniMC framework and a new dataset, HAIG-2.9M, to handle multi-class and overlapping instances with improved control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing keypoint-guided text-to-image diffusion models struggle to handle non-rigid objects like animals or generate overlapping human-animal scenes due to methodological limitations and inadequate datasets.

Method: The proposed UniMC framework encodes instance- and keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens with integrated attributes (class, bounding box, keypoints). The HAIG-2.9M dataset provides diverse, high-quality annotations for keypoint-guided generation of humans and animals.

Result: UniMC and HAIG-2.9M demonstrate enhanced performance in generating multi-class images, particularly in handling heavy occlusions and overlapping objects, achieving superior levels of control and quality.

Conclusion: The proposed UniMC framework and HAIG-2.9M dataset significantly improve keypoint-guided text-to-image generation by overcoming previous method limitations and dataset restrictions, proving effective for challenging scenarios involving multi-class and occluded cases.

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class

### [129] [FairHuman: Boosting Hand and Face Quality in Human Image Generation with Minimum Potential Delay Fairness in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02714)
*Yuxuan Wang,Tianwei Cao,Huayu Zhang,Zhongjiang He,Kongming Liang,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairHuman introduces a fine-tuning method to improve the generation of human image details like faces and hands using multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of generating realistic human images, focusing on enhancing details such as faces and hands which often lack sufficient supervision in large-scale diffusion models.

Method: The authors propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning approach with three learning objectives: a global diffusion-based objective and two local objectives for faces and hands, optimized using Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) for fairness-aware optimization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that FairHuman significantly improves detail generation (faces, hands) in human image synthesis while preserving overall image quality.

Conclusion: FairHuman successfully enhances challenging local details and global image quality in human image generation, showcasing its effectiveness across different scenarios.

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

*Mélanie Gaillochet,Mehrdad Noori,Sahar Dastani,Christian Desrosiers,Hervé Lombaert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method for automating segmentation in medical imaging using bounding box annotations and foundation models, achieving strong results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-wise annotations in medical imaging are time-consuming and costly, making weakly supervised methods based on simpler bounding box annotations more practical.

Method: Develops a framework that uses bounding box annotations to automate prompt generation for vision foundation models, integrating this with constraints and pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in limited data scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines foundation models' capabilities with weakly supervised segmentation to improve efficiency and performance in medical imaging.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MANO, a model that computes attention in a multiscale manner, achieving linear complexity and competing with state-of-the-art methods like ViT and Swin Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers, especially for processing high-resolution inputs.

Method: Inspired by $n$-body numerical simulations, MANO computes attention as an interaction problem using a multiscale distance-based approach, ensuring linear time/memory complexity.

Result: Empirical results show MANO performs competitively against advanced models in image classification and physics-related tasks, reducing runtime and memory usage significantly.

Conclusion: MANO provides a scalable attention mechanism balancing performance and computational efficiency, with real-world application potential and open-source reproducibility offered.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

### [132] [Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02751)
*Mingxin Liu,Peiyuan Zhang,Yuan Liu,Wei Zhang,Yue Zhou,Ning Liao,Ziyang Gong,Junwei Luo,Zhirui Wang,Yi Yu,Xue Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cost-effective framework for oriented object detection using partially weak annotations, outperforming existing methods while leveraging unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation costs for oriented object detection hinder its widespread adoption and demand innovative solutions for cost-effective methods.

Method: The paper proposes the Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework, combining an OS-Student model for orientation and scale learning with limited annotations and CPF for pseudo-label filtering.

Result: Experiments across various datasets (DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0, DIOR) show that PWOOD surpasses existing semi-supervised and weakly supervised methods in performance.

Conclusion: PWOOD effectively reduces annotation costs and achieves competitive or superior performance compared to traditional oriented object detection methods.

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

### [133] [From Pixels to Damage Severity: Estimating Earthquake Impacts Using Semantic Segmentation of Social Media Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02781)
*Danrong Zhang,Huili Huang,N. Simrill Smith,Nimisha Roy,J. David Frost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic segmentation method for assessing earthquake damage severity in social media images, addressing the limitations of traditional classification-based analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earthquake disaster response heavily relies on social media images for immediate damage insights, but traditional classification methods are subjective and fail to capture varying extents of damage.

Method: The study created a segmented damage dataset (with undamaged structures, damaged structures, and debris), fine-tuned a SegFormer model for semantic segmentation of these images, and proposed a new damage severity scoring system that incorporates depth estimation.

Result: The approach successfully quantified damage severity in social media images more objectively and comprehensively.

Conclusion: The work enriches disaster reconnaissance capabilities by providing precise damage assessments, ensuring targeted and efficient earthquake response efforts.

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

### [134] [RichControl: Structure- and Appearance-Rich Training-Free Spatial Control for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02792)
*Liheng Zhang,Lexi Pang,Hang Ye,Xiaoxuan Ma,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a flexible framework enhancing structural and appearance aspects in text-to-image diffusion models using feature injection, without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to address issues like structural misalignment and visual artifacts in text-to-image generation when using conditioned features diverging from RGB distributions.

Method: The approach involves decoupling injection timesteps from denoising, introducing a structure-rich injection module, appearance-rich prompting, and restart refinement strategies.

Result: The proposed framework shows state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conditioning scenarios, achieving improved structure and appearance control.

Conclusion: Training-free generation methods can achieve high-quality image results by leveraging advanced injection strategies for better alignment and preservation.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

*Miguel Espinosa,Chenhongyi Yang,Linus Ericsson,Steven McDonagh,Elliot J. Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free approach to object segmentation using reference images and foundation models to match semantic features, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional segmentation models require extensive labeled datasets, and even the Segment Anything Model (SAM) depends on manual or complex prompt-generation. This paper aims to simplify the segmentation process by using few reference images instead.

Method: The method involves three stages: (1) constructing a memory bank, (2) aggregating representations, and (3) performing semantic-aware feature matching, all training-free and leveraging semantic priors from foundation models.

Result: The proposed approach achieves high performance on major benchmarks: 36.8% nAP on COCO FSOD, 71.2% nAP50 on PASCAL VOC Few-Shot, and 22.4% nAP on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that object correspondence using semantic priors and reference images can reduce manual annotation burdens while achieving impressive segmentation performance without requiring training.

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

*Gent Serifi,Marcel C. Bühler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HyperGaussians, an extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting, for creating high-quality, animatable face avatars with improved detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the quality and realism of animatable face avatars from monocular videos, which currently fall short of capturing fine details, nonlinear deformations, and complex lighting effects.

Method: The authors reimagine 3D Gaussian representation by extending it to higher-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, termed HyperGaussians. They address computational challenges through the 'inverse covariance trick,' enabling efficient integration with existing models.

Result: HyperGaussians, when integrated into FlashAvatar, outperform 3D Gaussian Splatting in terms of numerical accuracy and visual fidelity, particularly for intricate details and complex facial movements.

Conclusion: HyperGaussians significantly enhance the expressiveness and realism of face avatars, pushing the boundaries of monocular video rendering technologies.

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LangScene-X, a framework to recover and understand 3D scenes with open-vocabulary queries from sparse 2D image inputs, addressing issues like rendering artifacts in limited-view setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome challenges in 3D reconstruction and semantic understanding of scenes from limited 2D image views, as existing methods struggle with rendering artifacts and lack generalization.

Method: The framework introduces a TriMap video diffusion model for RGB, geometry, and semantic generation and a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC) for encoding efficient language embeddings, enabling 3D scene reconstruction and language integration.

Result: LangScene-X demonstrates superior 3D reconstruction quality and generalizability on real-world datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LangScene-X successfully addresses limitations of prior systems, providing a robust approach to open-vocabulary scene reconstruction and understanding, making it effective even with sparse inputs.

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, DCDP-HAR, for improving multimodal human activity recognition by addressing challenges in feature alignment and modality contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced contributions in multimodal human activity recognition systems.

Method: The proposed framework employs a dual-path architecture using ResNet and DenseNet, multi-stage contrastive learning for feature alignment, and gradient modulation to balance modality contributions. A momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is also used.

Result: The authors conducted ablation studies and extensive experiments on four public datasets to validate the performance improvements of their proposed system.

Conclusion: The DCDP-HAR framework effectively addresses key challenges in sensor-based human activity recognition, offering improved feature alignment and dynamic balancing of modality contributions.

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human activity recognition (HAR) method using unsupervised data augmentation and a spatio-temporal attention network, achieving high accuracy across datasets and efficient deployment on lightweight devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human activity recognition faces challenges like limited labeled data, poor feature extraction, and underperformance on lightweight devices, despite its importance in health monitoring, safety, and sports.

Method: The paper employs a statistics-guided diffusion model for data augmentation, multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction networks for feature extraction, and an adaptive multi-loss function strategy for model optimization.

Result: USAD achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% on WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY datasets respectively, outperforming existing methods. Deployment tests confirm efficiency on embedded devices.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively tackles data scarcity and feature extraction challenges, offering high accuracy and practical use for HAR in embedded systems.

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AnyI2V, a training-free framework for animating conditional images with user-defined motion trajectories, overcoming limitations in precision and editability seen in existing T2V and I2V methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges stem from the lack of precise control in generating spatial layouts and dependencies on input constraints in existing methods.

Method: AnyI2V is a training-free framework that enables the animation of a broader range of modalities and supports mixed conditional inputs for more versatile video generation.

Result: AnyI2V showcases superior performance and expands possibilities in motion-controlled video generation with flexible inputs, editing options, and style transfers.

Conclusion: The framework opens up more versatile approaches to video synthesis, advancing both spatial and dynamic control levels in generated content.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

*Jiaer Xia,Bingkui Tong,Yuhang Zang,Rui Shao,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the adaptation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specialized vision tasks, such as chart understanding, by injecting grounding information into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data to improve model performance under data-constrained situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of adapting MLLMs, which are pre-trained on general datasets, to specialized tasks like chart and table understanding due to dataset mismatches.

Method: A bootstrapping-based approach called Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), which integrates grounding information such as bounding boxes into reasoning data to improve faithfulness to input images.

Result: The proposed GCoT approach is evaluated on five specialized vision tasks, covering diverse formats, and demonstrates superior performance compared to fine-tuning and distillation under data-limited conditions.

Conclusion: GCoT effectively enhances MLLM adaptation for specialized vision tasks by correcting reasoning data errors and grounding reasoning steps, proving its value in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EasyCache, a training-free framework to accelerate video diffusion models by caching and reusing computation, resulting in 2.1-3.3x faster inference and improved video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the slow inference speeds and high computational costs of video generation models, which hinder their broader adoption and real-world applications.

Method: EasyCache employs a runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that reuses previously computed transformation vectors to avoid redundant calculations during inference. It does not require offline profiling or parameter tuning.

Result: EasyCache accelerates inference by 2.1-3.3x compared to baselines, preserves high visual fidelity, and improves PSNR by up to 36% over the previous best method.

Conclusion: EasyCache is an efficient and accessible solution for video generation, facilitating high-quality video synthesis in both research and practical environments.

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original

*Zhening Huang,Xiaoyang Wu,Fangcheng Zhong,Hengshuang Zhao,Matthias Nießner,Joan Lasenby*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteReality is a groundbreaking pipeline that converts indoor RGB-D scans into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas, combining visually accurate reconstructions, high-quality materials, and interactive behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of creating visually realistic and interactive 3D virtual replicas from RGB-D scans while ensuring compactness, object individuality, and compatibility with graphics pipelines for AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins.

Method: LiteReality uses a four-step pipeline: 1) scene understanding and structured scene graph creation, 2) reconstruction using visually similar artist-crafted 3D models, 3) material enhancement via the Material Painting module for spatially varying realism, and 4) integration into a simulation engine for interactive physical behavior.

Result: LiteReality achieves state-of-the-art performance in object retrieval (Scan2CAD benchmark) and robust material painting under challenging conditions, and demonstrates successful reconstruction on both real-world scans and public datasets.

Conclusion: LiteReality provides compact, editable, high-quality 3D scene reconstructions compatible with standard graphics pipelines and extends the capabilities for AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twin applications.

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

*Xiang Fan,Xiaohang Sun,Kushan Thakkar,Zhu Liu,Vimal Bhat,Ranjay Krishna,Xiang Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes RefTok, a reference-based tokenization method for videos that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of metrics and video generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of effectively capturing temporal dependencies and handling redundancy in video models, which current methods struggle with by treating frames independently.

Method: RefTok introduces a reference-based tokenization technique for encoding and decoding sets of video frames using an unquantized reference frame. This approach effectively captures temporal dynamics and contextual information, preserving motion continuity and object appearance.

Result: RefTok outperforms state-of-the-art tokenizers (e.g., Cosmos and MAGVIT) on 4 video datasets, improving metrics by an average of 36.7%. Additionally, it enhances video generation performance, surpassing larger models like MAGVIT-L by an average of 27.9%.

Conclusion: RefTok demonstrates a superior ability to handle temporal redundancy and contextual information in videos, resulting in significant metric improvements and better generation performance compared to existing models.

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

*Yuqi Wu,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Point3R, an online framework for dense 3D scene reconstruction using an explicit spatial pointer memory for information aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction methods relying on implicit memory are limited by capacity and information loss from earlier frames.

Method: Point3R introduces an explicit spatial pointer memory directly linked to 3D scene structure, along with a hierarchical position embedding and efficient fusion mechanism for seamless integration.

Result: Experiments show that Point3R delivers competitive to state-of-the-art performance across tasks, requiring lower training costs.

Conclusion: Point3R provides an effective framework for dense 3D scene reconstruction from streaming images, overcoming previous limitations and ensuring efficiency.

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

### [147] [Signalling Health for Improved Kubernetes Microservice Availability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02158)
*Jacob Roberts,Blair Archibald,Phil Trinder*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Signal-based Container Monitoring (SCM) for Kubernetes, showing it detects container failures faster and more accurately than Poll-based Monitoring (PCM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve service availability through an effective monitoring method for containers in orchestrated environments, addressing PCM's limitations like slower detection and potential errors.

Method: The authors developed and tested an SCM-based approach for Kubernetes, benchmarked via SockShop, and compared it against PCM using mathematical modeling and empirical experiments.

Result: SCM detects container failure 86% faster than PCM, with comparable detection time for readiness, minimized resource overheads, and avoids erroneous failure detections present in PCM.

Conclusion: SCM enhances container monitoring by eliminating PCM's polling tuning needs, reducing false positives, and improving availability, recommending its adoption in orchestrators for better performance.

Abstract: Microservices are often deployed and managed by a container orchestrator that
can detect and fix failures to maintain the service availability critical in
many applications. In Poll-based Container Monitoring (PCM), the orchestrator
periodically checks container health. While a common approach, PCM requires
careful tuning, may degrade service availability, and can be slow to detect
container health changes. An alternative is Signal-based Container Monitoring
(SCM), where the container signals the orchestrator when its status changes. We
present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an SCM approach for
Kubernetes and empirically show that it has benefits over PCM, as predicted by
a new mathematical model. We compare the service availability of SCM and PCM
over six experiments using the SockShop benchmark. SCM does not require that
polling intervals are tuned, and yet detects container failure 86\% faster than
PCM and container readiness in a comparable time with limited resource
overheads. We find PCM can erroneously detect failures, and this reduces
service availability by 4\%. We propose that orchestrators offer SCM features
for faster failure detection than PCM without erroneous detections or careful
tuning.

*Bruce Fang,Danyi Gao*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a transfer learning algorithm to effectively identify fault root causes in cloud environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fault root cause identification in cloud computing is challenging due to complex system structures, dense service coupling, and limited fault information.

Method: The study utilizes a transfer learning algorithm with a shared feature extraction module, domain adversarial mechanism, and pseudo-label selection strategy to enable effective knowledge transfer.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method compared to mainstream approaches under conditions of label scarcity, class imbalance, and heterogeneous node structures.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm proves effective and robust in handling complex environments, showcasing high performance even under extreme scenarios.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fault root cause identification in
cloud computing environments. The difficulty arises from complex system
structures, dense service coupling, and limited fault information. To solve
this problem, an intelligent identification algorithm based on transfer
learning is proposed. The method introduces a shared feature extraction module
and a domain adversarial mechanism to enable effective knowledge transfer from
the source domain to the target domain. This improves the model's
discriminative ability and generalization performance in the target domain. The
model incorporates a pseudo-label selection strategy. When labeled samples are
lacking in the target domain, high-confidence predictions are used in training.
This enhances the model's ability to recognize minority classes. To evaluate
the stability and adaptability of the method in real-world scenarios,
experiments are designed under three conditions: label scarcity, class
imbalance, and heterogeneous node environments. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream approaches in several key
metrics, including accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. The model demonstrates stronger
discriminative power and robustness. Notably, under extreme class imbalance and
significant structural differences in the target domain, the model still
maintains high performance. This validates the effectiveness and practical
value of the proposed mechanisms in complex cloud computing systems.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flotilla, a scalable and lightweight Federated Learning (FL) framework optimized for deployment on real edge devices with fault tolerance and asynchronous support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of FL frameworks optimized for deployment on real edge hardware, and to enhance resilience, asynchronous support, and scalability in FL systems.

Method: Created Flotilla framework with a modular "user-first" design, stateless clients, and servers with session state checkpointing. Evaluated its performance on multiple FL strategies, DNN models, and fault-tolerance scenarios.

Result: Flotilla showcased effective fault tolerance with 200+ clients, rapid failover capabilities, and better or competitive resource usage compared to other FL frameworks on edge devices. It also scaled significantly better for 1000+ clients.

Conclusion: Flotilla is a promising framework for building and deploying FL strategies in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner, enabling effective systems research and optimizations.

Abstract: With the recent improvements in mobile and edge computing and rising concerns
of data privacy, Federated Learning(FL) has rapidly gained popularity as a
privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning methodology. Several FL
frameworks have been built for testing novel FL strategies. However, most focus
on validating the learning aspects of FL through pseudo-distributed simulation
but not for deploying on real edge hardware in a distributed manner to
meaningfully evaluate the federated aspects from a systems perspective. Current
frameworks are also inherently not designed to support asynchronous
aggregation, which is gaining popularity, and have limited resilience to client
and server failures. We introduce Flotilla, a scalable and lightweight FL
framework. It adopts a ``user-first'' modular design to help rapidly compose
various synchronous and asynchronous FL strategies while being agnostic to the
DNN architecture. It uses stateless clients and a server design that separates
out the session state, which are periodically or incrementally checkpointed. We
demonstrate the modularity of Flotilla by evaluating five different FL
strategies for training five DNN models. We also evaluate the client and
server-side fault tolerance on 200+ clients, and showcase its ability to
rapidly failover within seconds. Finally, we show that Flotilla's resource
usage on Raspberry Pis and Nvidia Jetson edge accelerators are comparable to or
better than three state-of-the-art FL frameworks, Flower, OpenFL and FedML. It
also scales significantly better compared to Flower for 1000+ clients. This
positions Flotilla as a competitive candidate to build novel FL strategies on,
compare them uniformly, rapidly deploy them, and perform systems research and
optimizations.

Motivation: Traditional HPC systems lack flexibility and composability to meet diverse scientific needs.

Method: Developed 'Alps' infrastructure with independent resources, heterogeneous hardware, modular storage, and vCluster tech for customizable platforms.

Result: Alps operates successfully across scientific domains like weather prediction and AI research.

Conclusion: Alps addresses scientific diversity through a flexible, modular, and innovative HPC design.

Abstract: The Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) has a long-standing tradition
of delivering top-tier high-performance computing systems, exemplified by the
Piz Daint supercomputer. However, the increasing diversity of scientific needs
has exposed limitations in traditional vertically integrated HPC architectures,
which often lack flexibility and composability. To address these challenges,
CSCS developed Alps, a next-generation HPC infrastructure designed with a
transformative principle: resources operate as independent endpoints within a
high-speed network. This architecture enables the creation of independent
tenant-specific and platform-specific services, tailored to diverse scientific
requirements.
  Alps incorporates heterogeneous hardware, including CPUs and GPUs,
interconnected by a high-performance Slingshot network, and offers a modular
storage system. A key innovation is the versatile software-defined cluster
(vCluster) technology, which bridges cloud and HPC paradigms. By abstracting
infrastructure, service management, and user environments into distinct layers,
vClusters allow for customized platforms that support diverse workloads.
Current platforms on Alps serve various scientific domains, including numerical
weather prediction, and AI research.

*Xing Liu,Lizhuo Luo,Ming Tang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlowSpec is a framework for improving distributed LLM inference efficiency, achieving speedups of 1.36×-1.77× compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed inference aims to make large language model processing feasible at the network edge by fitting models across device memory. However, pipeline-based approaches suffer reduced efficiency when requests at the edge are sparse.

Method: FlowSpec uses pipeline-parallel speculative decoding with three key mechanisms: score-based step-wise verification, efficient draft token management, and dynamic draft expansion strategies to optimize decoding efficiency.

Result: Experimental findings show significant inference speed improvements across various models, with speedup ratios of 1.36×-1.77× over baseline approaches.

Conclusion: FlowSpec can enhance both pipeline utilization and speculative efficiency, making it a promising method for efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge.

Abstract: Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the
inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes
the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into
the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to
parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference
latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the
network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To
enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose
\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding
framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding
efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important
draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to
prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during
verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality
speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline
utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world
testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models
and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared
to baselines. Our code is publicly available at

*Mengtao Yan,Qi Wang,Haining Wang,Ruizhi Chengze,Yi Zhang,Hongsheng Liu,Zidong Wang,Fan Yu,Qi Qi,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LDSolver, a machine learning-based differentiable finite volume solver for fluid simulations that is efficient and generalizable, achieving state-of-the-art results on coarse grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical solvers for fluid simulations on fine grids are computationally expensive, while existing machine learning models lack interpretability and generalizability. The paper proposes LDSolver to address these challenges.

Method: LDSolver integrates a differentiable finite volume solver with a learnable module for flux approximation and temporal error correction on coarse grids, enabling efficient and accurate simulations with limited training data.

Result: LDSolver demonstrates superior performance on different fluid systems, surpassing baseline models while maintaining high accuracy and generalizability, even with constrained data.

Conclusion: The proposed LDSolver provides an efficient and accurate solution to fluid simulation challenges, improving computational efficiency while overcoming the limitations of traditional and machine learning-based approaches.

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to combat the limitations of current traffic demand forecasting models by addressing the challenges in capturing complex spatiotemporal relationships.

Method: The method involves the development of DK-GCN for spatial clustering using Dynamic Time Warping and K-means, along with incorporating FFT in a bidirectional Mamba framework for temporal dependencies, and optimizing training with GRPO reinforcement learning.

Result: The model demonstrates superior performance compared to advanced models across three public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DKGCM effectively integrates spatiotemporal learning techniques and reinforcement learning for traffic demand prediction, significantly enhancing forecast accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of misinformation during elections and crises by exploring the under-researched area of multimodal feature combinations for detection.

Method: The study used an early fusion approach combining text, images, and social features analyzed from 1,529 COVID-19- and election-related tweets through data enrichment processes like object detection and OCR.

Result: Combining machine learning models enhanced classification performance by 15% over unimodal and 5% over bimodal models, revealing superior misinformation detection capabilities.

Conclusion: Using multimodal feature combinations is more effective for misinformation detection, and understanding propagation patterns can offer additional insights into combating false information.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

*Hexiang Bai,Deyu Li,Jiye Liang,Yanhui Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a feature selection method for massive datasets combining sampling techniques and rough set theory, ensuring high discriminatory ability within acceptable computing resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of feature selection for massive datasets, particularly as intelligent machines often lack sufficient computational resources to process vast amounts of data.

Method: The method uses the ratio of discernible object pairs to all object pairs to measure discriminatory ability and constructs positive region preserved samples to identify subsets of features. It employs rough set theory and sampling techniques.

Result: The experimental results on 11 datasets show that approximate reducts can be found quickly while maintaining better discriminatory ability than the estimated lower boundary, even with large-scale data.

Conclusion: The proposed feature selection method effectively balances computational efficiency and feature discriminatory ability, validating its practicality on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly prediction in semiconductor manufacturing is challenging due to factors like high data dimensionality, class imbalance, noisy data, and delayed fault emergence.

Method: The paper proposes transforming multivariate time-series (MTS) data into image representations using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), fine-tuning a VGG-16 image classifier, and employing a Siamese network for comparing reference and query signals.

Result: The proposed approach achieves high accuracy in detecting anomalies using time-series data from an actual semiconductor manufacturing process.

Conclusion: This methodology presents a robust, flexible solution for anomaly detection in semiconductor fabrication, applicable in both supervised and semi-supervised environments.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

*Anurag Arnab,Ahmet Iscen,Mathilde Caron,Alireza Fathi,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Chain of Thought, a strategy to improve long-video understanding in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by curating the input context iteratively based on frame relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in effectively handling long-video understanding and avoiding distractions within large context windows.

Method: The proposed method, Temporal Chain of Thought, uses VLMs to iteratively select the most relevant frames from a video, optimizing the input context for better question-answering performance.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on four video question-answering datasets, particularly excelling in long videos (over 1 hour), and outperforms baselines with significantly larger context windows.

Conclusion: Temporal Chain of Thought improves long-video understanding by leveraging iterative frame selection, offering superior performance using smaller context windows and demonstrating scalability at inference time.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of cross-subject motor imagery classification in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces by introducing a deep learning-based approach leveraging optimized STFT preprocessing and CNNs, validated on diverse datasets with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the poor classification accuracy of cross-subject motor imagery in BCIs due to individual variability in EEG patterns, impeding the development of calibration-free BCIs for practical applications.

Method: The proposed method directly classifies STFT-transformed EEG data, employs optimized STFT parameters, and uses a balanced batching strategy during CNN training. Four datasets, including three benchmark ones, are used for validation.

Result: The method achieves significant accuracy improvements: 67.60% (Dataset IV-1), 65.96% (Dataset IV-2A), and 80.22% (Dataset IV-2B), surpassing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The study provides a new benchmark for calibration-free, generalizable motor imagery classification and offers an open-access dataset to drive further research in this domain.

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

*Shakya Jayakody,Youpeng Zhao,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents AIRES, an algorithm-system co-design solution to enhance performance in out-of-core sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) for GCNs, reducing latency and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing performance bottlenecks such as high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization in out-of-core SpGEMM due to growing graph data size and limited GPU memory in constrained systems.

Method: AIRES combines algorithmic improvements like block-level alignment and row block-wise tiling with a system-level three-phase dynamic scheduling strategy using a tiered memory system comprising GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage, and host memory.

Result: AIRES achieves up to 1.8x lower latency compared to state-of-the-art methods when applied to real-world graph processing benchmarks.

Conclusion: AIRES effectively mitigates performance bottlenecks in out-of-core SpGEMM, making it a superior solution for graph convolutional networks in resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

*Wanjia Zhao,Jiaqi Han,Siyi Gu,Mingjian Jiang,James Zou,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoAda, an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of geometric diffusion models for diverse downstream tasks, preserving geometric consistency and mitigating performance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometric diffusion models excel in various tasks but lack efficient methodologies for fine-tuning on diverse downstream tasks with flexible geometric controls while maintaining performance and original inductive biases.

Method: GeoAda employs a structured adapter framework using coupling and decoupling operators and a lightweight trainable copy of certain pretrained layers. It ensures SE(3)-equivariance, preserves geometric inductive biases, and fine-tunes only small adapter modules without altering the original architecture.

Result: GeoAda showcases superior fine-tuning performance across various geometric control tasks and domains while avoiding overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. It outperforms baselines that suffer significant degradation in task accuracy.

Conclusion: GeoAda is effective for parameter-efficient adaptation of geometric diffusion models to downstream tasks. It maintains original geometric biases and task accuracy, thus resolving overfitting and forgetting issues common in alternative approaches.

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

*Eitan Anzenberg,Arunava Samajpati,Sivasankaran Chandrasekar,Varun Kacholia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares large language models (LLMs) from major developers to a proprietary hiring model (Match Score), showing Match Score is more accurate and fair in candidate matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reliability and fairness concerns when using LLMs in high-stakes hiring scenarios.

Method: Benchmarking various LLMs and the Match Score model on their predictive accuracy and fairness in hiring outcomes, using metrics like ROC AUC and demographic impact ratios.

Result: Match Score outperformed LLMs on accuracy and fairness, achieving near-parity in demographic impact ratios.

Conclusion: Domain-specific models and bias auditing are essential for deploying fair and accurate AI in hiring, as off-the-shelf LLMs may propagate biases.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

### [162] [Sample Complexity Bounds for Linear Constrained MDPs with a Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02089)
*Xingtu Liu,Lin F. Yang,Sharan Vaswani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses infinite-horizon constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with a primal-dual framework. It provides sample complexity bounds for relaxed and strict feasibility CMDPs, showing near-optimal dependencies on key parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) effectively using a primal-dual framework that works alongside any black-box unconstrained MDP solver. This approach aims to find optimal policies under constraint satisfaction efficiently.

Method: The authors propose a primal-dual framework leveraging mirror descent value iteration (MDVI) as the unconstrained MDP solver. They derive sample complexity bounds for both relaxed and strict feasibility cases of CMDPs.

Result: The framework achieves sample complexities of \(\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)\) for relaxed feasibility and \(\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)\) for strict feasibility. These results show near-optimal dependencies on dimension \(d\), discount factor \((1-\gamma)\), and approximation parameter \(\epsilon\).

Conclusion: The proposed framework proves effective in solving CMDPs with rigorous sample complexity guarantees, leveraging MDVI as a solver. It applies to both linear and tabular CMDPs, offering practical solutions with near-optimal performance.

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses improving constrained text generation using iterative self-distillation, building upon twisted Sequential Monte Carlo approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of sparse and uninformative reward signals in constrained text generation where outputs are unlikely under the base model.

Method: The authors propose iterative self-distillation to refine the base model, progressively aligning it with the target distribution, and integrate it into twisted Sequential Monte Carlo methods.

Result: The approach of iterative self-distillation leads to significant improvement in the quality of generation outputs in constrained text generation tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that self-distillation can effectively align autoregressive language models with challenging constrained generation tasks, enhancing overall performance.

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

*Alexi Gladstone,Ganesh Nanduru,Md Mofijul Islam,Peixuan Han,Hyeonjeong Ha,Aman Chadha,Yilun Du,Heng Ji,Jundong Li,Tariq Iqbal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs), which are trained using unsupervised learning to improve general performance across tasks. They outperform existing models in efficiency and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for inference-time computation techniques suffer from limitations such as being modality-specific, problem-specific, or requiring additional supervision. The study aims to explore if unsupervised learning alone can enable models to demonstrate advanced inference and thinking.

Method: The authors propose Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs), a type of Energy-Based Model, to compute energy values for input and predictions. Prediction is reframed as an optimization problem, modeled through gradient descent-based energy minimization.

Result: EBTs achieve a faster scaling rate (up to 35%) during training compared to Transformer++, deliver a 29% higher performance improvement in language tasks during inference, outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising with fewer forward passes, and generalize better across downstream tasks.

Conclusion: EBTs offer a new paradigm that successfully scales the learning and reasoning capabilities of models, presenting a significant step forward in generalizing System 2 thinking approaches through unsupervised methods.

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

Conclusion: PANAMA demonstrates how active learning can minimize the sample size needed for training parametric guitar amp models.

Abstract: We introduce PANAMA, an active learning framework for the training of
end-to-end parametric guitar amp models using a WaveNet-like architecture. With
\model, one can create a virtual amp by recording samples that are determined
by an active learning strategy to use a minimum amount of datapoints (i.e., amp

to determine the optimal datapoints to sample, and that the approach helps
under a constrained number of samples.

*Vaidehi Srinivas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores conformal prediction in an online framework, aiming to ensure coverage while minimizing interval length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of constructing efficient confidence intervals across sequential data with varying statistical properties.

Method: The study develops algorithms for conformal prediction under exchangeable and arbitrary sequences, designing a deterministic algorithm that optimizes coverage and interval efficiency.

Result: For exchangeable sequences, the algorithm achieves near-optimal coverage and interval length. For arbitrary sequences, a tradeoff in errors occurs depending on the desired approximation.

Conclusion: The authors highlight intrinsic differences between handling exchangeable and arbitrary data sequences and introduce a near-optimal algorithm addressing both scenarios, though no single solution is universally optimal.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

*Shikai Qiu,Lechao Xiao,Andrew Gordon Wilson,Jeffrey Pennington,Atish Agarwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discovers a universal scaling behavior in the training dynamics of neural networks, where loss curves collapse onto a single curve after normalization under compute-optimal settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand the scaling behavior governing neural network training dynamics when both model size and training time increase simultaneously.

Method: The study employs theoretical analysis combined with experiments on various architectures, datasets, learning rate schedules, and hyperparameter scaling to investigate the observed universal behavior.

Result: The study reports a universal loss curve collapse ('supercollapse') across compute-optimally trained models. The phenomenon is robust to noise and holds across diverse settings but breaks under suboptimal hyperparameter scaling.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a practical and precise indicator of optimal neural network scaling, linked to power-law behaviors and SGD noise dynamics.

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CROP, a Large Language Model-powered framework for optimizing VLSI design parameters, demonstrating efficiency improvements over existing methods, including reduced power consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and vast parameter space in VLSI design flow optimization make manual parameter selection laborious and limited by human expertise.

Method: CROP employs scalable vector transformations for RTL source code, an embedding-based retrieval system for design matching, and an LLM-guided parameter search enhanced by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Result: CROP achieves improved quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations, including a power consumption reduction of 9.9% in industrial designs.

Conclusion: CROP effectively automates VLSI design flow optimization using LLM-powered assistance, outperforming traditional manual or existing automated methods while reducing resource and energy usage.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power
consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon traditional classification methods like support vector machines by introducing a robust alternative that handles complex decision boundaries efficiently.

Method: The approach searches for parameter vectors in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube and optimizes an entropy-based function across the space of unknown variables. It generalizes to polynomial surfaces for non-linear separations.

Result: The method achieves efficient and versatile performance in both linear and non-linear classification tasks, as shown via numerical experiments.

Conclusion: This entropy-based technique is a robust and flexible alternative to traditional classification methods, demonstrating promising results for diverse classification challenges.

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

Motivation: The paper seeks to overcome the limitations of generative models in controllability and reconstruction accuracy to make them more applicable to data compression.

Method: It combines a variational autoencoder with a conditional diffusion model, compressing keyframes into latent space and employing generative interpolation for reconstructing remaining frames.

Result: The method achieves up to 10x higher compression ratios compared to rule-based methods like SZ3 and up to 63% better performance than leading learning-based approaches under the same reconstruction error.

Conclusion: This latent diffusion framework enables efficient and accurate spatiotemporal reconstruction with significantly reduced storage requirements.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

### [171] [Contextual Online Pricing with (Biased) Offline Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02762)
*Yixuan Zhang,Ruihao Zhu,Qiaomin Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines contextual online pricing with biased offline data, providing tight regret guarantees and optimal policies tied to the interplay between bias, data size, and other factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust algorithms and guarantees for contextual pricing when offline data is biased and the online optimal parameters are unknown.

Method: The study identifies key instance-dependent factors, such as bias and data dispersion, and designs Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty (OFU) policies. They provide both theoretical bounds and algorithmic adaptations, including a robust variant for unknown bias.

Result: Achieves minimax-optimal regret bounds for both scalar and general price elasticities, offering the first tight guarantees for this problem in the presence of biased offline data. The method also extends to stochastic linear bandits.

Conclusion: The paper successfully tackles biased offline data in contextual pricing, demonstrating effective algorithms with robust sub-linear regret and transferring these insights to related stochastic problems.

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

*Tuo Wang,Jian Kang,Yujun Yan,Adithya Kulkarni,Dawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NCPNET, an end-to-end conformal prediction framework designed for dynamic temporal graphs, addressing limitations in uncertainty quantification due to temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal prediction methods primarily address static graphs, but real-world graph applications often involve temporal evolution, violating key assumptions like exchangeability, limiting these methods' reliability for dynamic graphs.

Method: The authors introduce a diffusion-based non-conformity score to capture both topological and temporal uncertainties in evolving networks, paired with an efficiency-aware optimization algorithm to improve computational performance and reduce violations in coverage.

Result: NCPNET achieves guaranteed coverage for temporal graphs and enhances efficiency, reducing prediction set size by up to 31% on datasets such as WIKI. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NCPNET successfully extends conformal prediction to dynamic temporal graphs, ensuring reliable uncertainty quantification and improved efficiency, making it a promising tool for high-stakes applications involving evolving networks.

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

*Seung Hyun Cheon,Meredith Stewart,Bogdan Kulynych,Tsui-Wei Weng,Berk Ustun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a validation procedure to ensure predictions from machine learning models respond appropriately to interventions on input features, improving safety in applications like lending or hiring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often fail in safety-critical applications because they do not account for how individuals can adapt their inputs to influence predictions.

Method: The authors propose a sensitivity analysis framework that estimates how predictions respond to controlled feature interventions using black-box access. They use algorithms to generate samples of reachable points to evaluate responsiveness.

Result: The approach supports tasks like falsification and failure probability estimation and is demonstrated in applications such as recidivism prediction and content moderation, highlighting its safety benefits.

Conclusion: The proposed method ensures safer and more robust machine learning predictions by addressing feature responsiveness in a variety of practical, high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

*Jiyeon Bae,Hyeon Jeon,Jinwook Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a workflow to reduce bias in evaluating dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques by clustering highly correlated evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation bias in dimensionality reduction arises when highly correlated metrics are chosen, making it essential to create a fairer evaluation process.

Method: The authors compute pairwise correlations between metrics, cluster them based on empirical similarity, and select representative metrics from clusters.

Result: Quantitative results show that the proposed workflow enhances the stability of DR evaluations, reducing bias in metric selection.

Conclusion: The workflow effectively minimizes evaluation bias and ensures a more reliable assessment of DR projections for visual analytics.

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

*Xinquan Huang,Paris Perdikaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhysicsCorrect is a framework addressing error accumulation in neural network-based PDE simulations. It achieves this by enforcing physical consistency through an innovative correction mechanism, significantly reducing prediction errors with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses a critical limitation of neural networks in solving PDEs: error accumulation during long-term rollouts, which compromises accuracy and physical fidelity.

Method: PhysicsCorrect is a correction framework that enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by treating the correction as a linearized inverse problem. It precomputes the Jacobian and pseudoinverse in an offline phase, massively reducing computational costs.

Result: The framework achieves up to 100x reduction in prediction errors across various PDE systems (Navier-Stokes, wave equations, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky) while incurring less than 5% additional inference time.

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect substantially enhances the stability and reliability of neural surrogates for PDEs, providing a practical tool that integrates well with existing architectures for physically accurate scientific simulations.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

*Shravan Doda,Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VERBA, a method for generating verbal descriptions of differences between machine learning models using a large language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of similar-performing yet behaviorally different machine learning models creates challenges for users when comparing and selecting models due to the time-intensive nature of manually creating pairwise documentation.

Method: VERBA utilizes a large language model to produce verbalized descriptions of model differences based on their outputs. It further incorporates structural information for improved accuracy.

Result: VERBA achieved an 80% accuracy in detailing behavioral differences between models and up to 90% when structural information was included.

Conclusion: VERBA enhances transparency and comparability of machine learning models, making it a valuable post-hoc tool for understanding model behavior.

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

*Yang Yang,Xiaolu Zhou,Bosong Ding,Miao Xin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP) to address inefficiencies and inconsistencies in traditional RL reward design by integrating large language models (LLMs) and Bayesian optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges in conventional reward engineering methods, including inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and computational overhead of current automation attempts.

Method: URDP combines LLMs for reward logic reasoning with uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization. It uses self-consistency analysis for uncertainty estimation, simulation-free ineffective reward component identification, and bi-level optimization for reward component and hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Experimental results across 35 tasks in three benchmark environments show that URDP generates higher-quality rewards and significantly improves automated reward design efficiency compared to other methods.

Conclusion: URDP effectively addresses existing inefficiencies in reinforcement learning reward design, providing a novel framework that enhances both quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

*Fangzhou Shi,Xiaopeng Ke,Xinye Xiong,Kexin Meng,Chang Men,Zhengdan Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FCA-RL, a reinforcement learning framework, to help ride-hailing platforms optimize their coupon strategies under dynamic market conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of designing effective coupon strategies for ride-hailing service providers, taking into account competitive pricing dynamics and budget constraints.

Method: The paper introduces FCA-RL, which uses Fast Competition Adaptation for quick price adjustment responses and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment to maintain budget constraints. A simulation platform, RideGym, is also developed for testing.

Result: FCA-RL consistently outperforms other baseline strategies across various market scenarios, proving its efficiency.

Conclusion: FCA-RL provides a robust solution for subsidy optimization, offering competitive adaptability and budget adherence for ride-hailing service providers.

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication (KGZS-SC) network to improve interpretability and generalization, especially for unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven semantic communication methods rely on superficial statistical patterns, which lack interpretability and fail to generalize effectively with unseen data.

Method: The proposed KGZS-SC network incorporates a knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB) to align semantic features in an embedding space, reduce communication overhead, and enhance generalization. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is employed for direct classification of unseen cases.

Result: Simulations on the APY dataset demonstrate that KGZS-SC delivers robust generalization and significantly surpasses existing frameworks in classifying unseen categories across various SNR levels.

Conclusion: KGZS-SC addresses the interpretability and generalization challenges of semantic communication, excelling especially in dynamic or constrained environments with unseen data.

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

### [180] [Holistic Continual Learning under Concept Drift with Adaptive Memory Realignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02310)
*Alif Ashrafee,Jedrzej Kozal,Michal Wozniak,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses continual learning under concept drift, presenting "Adaptive Memory Realignment" (AMR) as a lightweight method for rehearsal-based learners to adapt data memory dynamically in response to concept drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning methods fail to address dynamic, real-world data streams where concept drift alters previously learned distributions, necessitating an approach that balances adaptation and stability.

Method: Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR) is introduced. It modifies replay buffers by removing outdated samples and replenishing with updated instances to counter concept drift, aiming to retain performance without retraining the model entirely.

Result: AMR matches the performance of Full Relearning while significantly reducing the computational and annotation requirements. Experiments show its effectiveness across modified versions of popular benchmarks with concept drift.

Conclusion: AMR offers an adaptable and efficient solution for continual learning environments, addressing concept drift with minimal overhead while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine
interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods
with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually
revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture,
which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these,
Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data
by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG
processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant
survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG
decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed
to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the
fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct
application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic
Transformer with other deep learning techniques
(convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial
networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This
paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of
Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeltaSHAP, an XAI method tailored for online patient monitoring, which explains prediction changes in real-time and outperforms existing methods in clinical time series analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing XAI methods fail to address the temporal and real-time requirements critical for explaining risk evolution in patient monitoring scenarios.

Method: DeltaSHAP adapts Shapley values for temporal settings to attribute feature changes using observed data combinations, and introduces evaluation metrics for faithfulness of attributions in online time-series.

Result: DeltaSHAP showed superior explanation quality (62% improvement) and computational efficiency (33% faster) compared to state-of-the-art XAI methods on the MIMIC-III dataset.

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP effectively meets the needs of clinical online time-series explanations, advancing both explanation quality and efficiency for time-sensitive applications.

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

*JunHyeok Oh,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a method for offline reinforcement learning that uses noise-injected actions and penalty terms to improve policy generalization and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL is limited by reliance on fixed datasets, where generalization abilities are necessary for better performance. Methods like diffusion models improve generalization but are computationally expensive, requiring simpler alternatives.

Method: PANI incorporates noise into actions to broaden the action space coverage and penalizes actions based on noise magnitude, inspired by diffusion models' principles. The concept stems from solving a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP).

Result: PANI improves performance in diverse offline RL benchmarks, demonstrating compatibility with various existing algorithms without significant computational overhead.

Conclusion: PANI offers a simpler yet effective alternative to diffusion models in offline RL algorithms, enhancing generalization and reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: This framework introduces efficient, model-free optimization for signal integrity in DRAM systems, validated by significant performance gains and broad applicability to various devices.

Abstract: Equalizer parameter optimization for signal integrity in high-speed Dynamic
Random Access Memory systems is crucial but often computationally demanding or
model-reliant. This paper introduces a data-driven framework employing learned
latent signal representations for efficient signal integrity evaluation,
coupled with a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent
for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal
integrity features, offering a fast alternative to direct eye diagram analysis
during optimization, while the reinforcement learning agent derives optimal
equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for

### [185] [Improving Consistency in Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Through Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02406)
*Caio Azevedo,Lina Achaji,Stefano Sabatini,Nicola Poerio,Grzegorz Bartyzel,Sascha Hornauer,Fabien Moutarde*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper fine-tunes trajectory prediction models for autonomous vehicles using preference optimization to improve inter-agent scene consistency, ensuring minimal loss in prediction accuracy without extra computational cost during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory prediction in autonomous vehicles often fails in interactive, complex scenarios due to lack of inter-agent dependency understanding, leading to inconsistent predictions.

Method: Fine-tuning trajectory prediction models using preference optimization, where rankings among predicted futures guide the optimization process, and no additional computational cost is incurred during inference.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art models and three datasets demonstrate significant improvements in scene consistency with only minimal sacrifices in prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating preference rankings into trajectory prediction models enhances scene consistency in multi-agent scenarios, addressing critical deficiencies while maintaining efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

*Zihan Tan,Suyuan Huang,Guancheng Wan,Wenke Huang,He Li,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces S2FGL, a framework aimed at improving Federated Graph Learning by addressing spatial and spectral challenges, including edge disruptions and spectral heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which suffers from issues such as edge disconnection and spectral heterogeneity that undermine global generalizability.

Method: The framework introduces a global knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruptions and leverages frequency alignment to tackle spectral client drifts.

Result: The proposed S2FGL framework shows superior performance in addressing spatial and spectral challenges through extensive experiments across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: S2FGL effectively manages spatial and spectral challenges in Federated Graph Learning, improving both local adaptation and global generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

*Francesco Alesiani,Henrik Christiansen,Federico Errica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces InfinityKAN, a new method for Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) that adaptively learns an infinite number of bases for univariate functions during training through a variational inference approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation in KANs where the number of bases for univariate functions is chosen ad-hoc, hindering their practicality as representation learning alternatives to MLPs.

Method: The method involves modeling the problem as a variational inference optimization process, enabling the adaptive learning of potentially unlimited bases using backpropagation.

Result: The proposed approach extends the applicability of KANs by removing the need for predefined hyperparameter selection for the number of bases.

Conclusion: InfinityKAN presents a significant advancement in KANs by making them more flexible and eliminating a critical bottleneck, paving the way for broader utilization in machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

*Chenxu Wang,Yilin Lyu,Zicheng Sun,Liping Jing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GORP, a novel training method for continual fine-tuning of LLMs, improving performance while addressing efficiency and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like LoRA are efficient but limit the model's expressiveness and transfer learning ability, necessitating a strategy that balances efficiency and learning capacity.

Method: GORP employs a unified low-rank gradient subspace to update both full and low-rank parameters simultaneously, expanding optimization space and addressing performance limitations of existing techniques.

Result: Experiments on continual learning benchmarks showed that GORP outperformed other state-of-the-art approaches, confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: GORP effectively balances efficiency and learning potential in continual fine-tuning, offering a robust solution to catastrophic forgetting and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is
available at https://github.com/Wcxwcxw/GORP.

*Alicja Rączkowska,Riccardo Belluzzo,Piotr Zieliński,Joanna Baran,Paweł Olszewski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RetrySQL introduces a unique training method for text-to-SQL models using corrupted reasoning steps for self-correction. This method boosts execution accuracy and offers competitive results with proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of SQL-specific generative models and the unexplored application of self-correcting strategies to the text-to-SQL task.

Method: Creation of retry data containing incorrect and corrected steps, used to pre-train open-source coding models and assess its impact.

Result: Retry data improves execution accuracy by up to 4 percentage points. Full-parameter pre-training is essential, and supervised fine-tuning is ineffective.

Conclusion: Self-correcting behavior can be learned for the text-to-SQL task, offering competitive outcomes with proprietary models despite fewer parameters.

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

### [190] [Position: A Theory of Deep Learning Must Include Compositional Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02550)
*David A. Danhofer,Davide D'Ascenzo,Rafael Dubach,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper argues that the success of overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) stems from their ability to exploit the compositional sparsity of target functions. It emphasizes the importance of understanding this principle for advancing deep learning theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open questions regarding the fundamental principles governing the learning dynamics of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and to explain their success in overcoming the curse of dimensionality.

Method: The authors analyze the concept of compositional sparsity, asserting that DNNs succeed by leveraging the idea that many relevant functions can be decomposed into smaller, low-dimensional component functions.

Result: The paper establishes that compositional sparsity is a property of efficiently Turing-computable functions and is likely present in most real-world learning problems. It highlights existing theoretical insights and identifies unanswered questions regarding learnability and optimization.

Conclusion: Compositional sparsity plays a fundamental role in deep learning's success. A deeper understanding of this property is essential for developing a comprehensive theory of artificial and general intelligence.

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

*Luca Baroni,Galvin Khara,Joachim Schaeffer,Marat Subkhankulov,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Layer normalization (LN) can be removed from GPT-2 models with minimal impact on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the role of layer normalization at inference time and improve interpretability of GPT-2 models by reducing non-linearities.

Method: The authors removed LN from all GPT-2 models and analyzed the impact on validation loss, fine-tuning requirements, and interpretability using specific techniques.

Result: Removing LN layers caused only a small increase in validation loss and required sublinear fine-tuning as model scale grew. LN-free models do not activate GPT-2's "confidence neurons."

Conclusion: GPT-2 models can function effectively without layer normalization, enabling better interpretability and understanding of language models.

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

*Fabian Kresse,Emily Yu,Christoph H. Lampert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces improvements to Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) by scaling interconnects with constant parameters and offering efficient model pruning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability and efficiency challenges in Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs), especially for resource-constrained hardware.

Method: Enhanced DBNs with a differentiable interconnect, scaling to wider layers, and employing two pruning stages: SAT-based logic equivalence and similarity-driven data pruning.

Result: The improved DBNs achieve scalable wide-layer interconnects with constant parameter count and reduced model size through pruning while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: The proposed advancements enhance DBN scalability and efficiency, offering better compression-accuracy trade-offs compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

TL;DR: This study uses Padé Approximant Neuron-based models (PadéNets) for induction machine fault diagnosis and finds them superior to conventional CNNs and Self-ONNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fault diagnosis in induction motors by using Padé Approximant Neural Networks, addressing limitations of conventional CNNs and Self-ONNs with vibration and acoustic data.

Method: The research compares one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and PadéNets on induction motor datasets, focusing on enhanced nonlinearity and unbounded activation functions in the models.

Result: PadéNets achieved superior diagnostic accuracies of up to 99.96%, outperforming baseline models on both vibration and acoustic datasets.

Conclusion: PadéNets' advanced nonlinearity and compatibility with unbounded activation functions lead to outstanding fault diagnosis performance, making them promising for motor condition monitoring.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in
induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model.
While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition
monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer
promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized
Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical
faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded
activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in
induction motor condition monitoring.

*Ramchalam Kinattinkara Ramakrishnan,Zhaocong Yuan,Shaojie Zhuo,Chen Feng,Yicheng Lin,Chenzheng Su,Xiaopeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniDraft introduces a framework allowing a single draft model to pair dynamically with multiple target models, improving speculative decoding speeds by 1.5-2x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address online deployment challenges where draft and target models are mismatched or dynamic latency improvements are required.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach using n-gram caching and hybrid distillation fine-tuning to adapt the single draft model with various target models and enhance drafting efficiency.

Result: Demonstrates 1.5-2x speedup in decoding with a single Llama-68M draft model, successfully pairing it with different target models.

Conclusion: OmniDraft enables efficient speculative decoding with any target model, especially suited for cost-effective and customizable on-device applications.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using latent-space diffusion models for emulating dynamical systems, finding them accurate, computationally efficient, and robust to high compression rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the need to overcome high computational costs of diffusion models during inference, especially for fast physics emulation.

Method: The authors investigate applying latent-space encoding to diffusion-based emulators of dynamical systems and assess its accuracy, diversity in predictions, and robustness to compression. They also explore the role of architectural and optimization choices.

Result: The study finds that latent-space emulation achieves high accuracy even with significant compression rates and offers more consistent accuracy and diversity compared to non-generative emulators.

Conclusion: Latent-space diffusion models are promising for computational efficiency and robust dynamical system emulation, aided by key design choices in training.

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

*Hazal Mogultay Ozcan,Sinan Kalkan,Fatos T. Yarman-Vural*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learnable VAE (L-VAE), an extension of β-VAE, which dynamically learns hyperparameters and achieves a balance between reconstruction and disentanglement losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of β-VAE where its hyperparameter, β, needs manual adjustment, and improve the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and disentanglement.

Method: A novel model, L-VAE, is proposed to dynamically learn the loss term weights and model parameters. An additional regularization term is introduced to avoid bias between reconstruction and disentanglement losses.

Result: L-VAE outperforms or matches competitors like β-VAE, ControlVAE, and others on datasets (dSprites, MPI3D, etc.), achieving superior disentanglement metrics. It also demonstrates qualitative success on the CelebA dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed L-VAE model dynamically balances disentanglement and reconstruction, showing consistent superior performance and broader applicability over existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

*Antoine Honoré,Borja Rodríguez Gálvez,Yoomi Park,Yitian Zhou,Volker M. Lauschke,Ming Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) for variant effect prediction, showing it surpasses current models while requiring fewer resources and exploring the use of DMS datasets for better predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current variant effect predictors often rely on MSAs, which assume evolutionary fitness for naturally occurring variations. This assumption may not hold for cases like pharmacogenomics. The paper explores an alternative approach using DMS datasets to derive more accurate predictions.

Method: The authors propose a transformer-based matVAE model with a structured prior, trained on both MSAs and DMS datasets. They evaluate its predictive performance on 33 DMS datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art models like DeepSequence.

Result: The matVAE-MSA model outperforms the DeepSequence model in zero-shot predictions on DMS data while using fewer parameters and computation. A DMS-trained version, matENC-DMS, performs better in supervised tasks, and incorporating AlphaFold structural insights further enhances predictions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that DMS datasets can be viable alternatives to MSAs for variant effect predictions, offering comparable performance with reduced computational costs. This supports further development and integration of DMS datasets for improving predictive models.

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Medical Data Pecking Tool (MDPT), leveraging software engineering methods to improve the quality of EHR data for research and AI training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure enhanced accuracy, completeness, and reliability of EHR data for epidemiology and AI research, addressing biases and data inconsistencies.

Method: The study adapts unit testing and coverage methods to identify EHR data issues, employing a tool with two components: automated test generator (leveraging large language models) and data testing framework.

Result: MDPT identified 20-43 data quality issues across three datasets (AoU, MIMIC-III, SyntheticMass) with 55-73 tests per cohort, demonstrating efficiency in highlighting non-aligned issues.

Conclusion: By integrating external medical knowledge, MDPT provides a context-sensitive method for data quality testing, forming a quality assurance basis for future developments.

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks to autonomously construct and solve task hierarchies using virtual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of relying entirely on human-generated data for machine learning training and to enable neural networks to autonomously learn and generalize across related tasks.

Method: The framework introduces a generative mechanism to create virtual tasks, which help meta-learners iteratively refine constraints, adapt learning, and generate novel, generalizable tasks. It uses a category-theoretic perspective where meta-learners function as functors to structure knowledge and abstraction.

Result: The framework establishes a compositional learning structure enabling structured generalization, iterative refinement, and enhanced knowledge transfer across tasks.

Conclusion: This architecture has the potential to advance machine learning towards general artificial intelligence by enabling autonomous generation of tasks and learning processes, supported by abstract generalization and compositional structures.

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

### [200] [ExPO: Unlocking Hard Reasoning with Self-Explanation-Guided Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02834)
*Ruiyang Zhou,Shuozhe Li,Amy Zhang,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO), a framework to improve reasoning in large language models by generating effective positive samples rather than relying on expert demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning improvements in large language models depend heavily on models' initial capabilities, making it difficult to solve problems requiring new reasoning trajectories beyond existing output distributions.

Method: The method, ExPO, generates effective positive samples by conditioning on ground-truth answers, meeting two key criteria: they must be likely under the current policy and increase prediction accuracy.

Result: ExPO improves learning efficiency and performance on reasoning benchmarks, outperforming expert-demonstration-based methods in challenging tasks such as MATH level-5.

Conclusion: ExPO provides a novel approach to efficiently guide language models in solving challenging reasoning tasks, offering superior results over traditional methods reliant on expert demonstrations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

### [201] [On Efficient Bayesian Exploration in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02639)
*Alberto Caron,Chris Hicks,Vasilios Mavroudis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses reinforcement learning's challenge of data-efficient exploration, presenting a method to align exploration with knowledge gaps using information-theoretic exploration bonuses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve data-efficient exploration in reinforcement learning, addressing theoretical gaps in methods motivated by intrinsic rewards based on epistemic uncertainty.

Method: Introduced Predictive Trajectory Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE), combining model-based planning with exploration bonuses, leveraging sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels, and Deep Ensemble models for tractable approximations.

Result: The proposed PTS-BE framework empirically outperformed baseline methods in environments with sparse rewards or demanding exploration tasks.

Conclusion: PTS-BE aligns exploration with epistemic knowledge gaps, ensures sample efficiency, and provides theoretical grounding for IG-based approaches in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

### [202] [Fair Deepfake Detectors Can Generalize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02645)
*Harry Cheng,Ming-Hui Liu,Yangyang Guo,Tianyi Wang,Liqiang Nie,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses the trade-off between fairness and generalization in deepfake detection, proposing a novel framework called DAID that improves both aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection struggles to balance fairness across demographics and generalization to unseen manipulations, as existing methods often present a trade-off between the two goals.

Method: The paper leverages causal relationships to propose a plug-and-play framework, DAID, which includes demographic-aware data rebalancing and demographic-agnostic feature aggregation, to address biases and improve detection.

Result: DAID outperforms state-of-the-art detection models in both fairness and generalization metrics across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed DAID framework effectively handles deepfake detection challenges by conceptualizing a causal approach and achieving superior performance in fairness and generalization.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

### [203] [Guided Generation for Developable Antibodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02670)
*Siqi Zhao,Joshua Moller,Porfi Quintero-Cadena,Lood van Niekerk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a guided discrete diffusion model to design therapeutic antibodies by optimizing their developability properties through computational methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Therapeutic antibodies require not only potency in targeting but also favorable properties like manufacturability, stability, and safety, collectively termed 'developability', which are essential for clinical effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose a guided discrete diffusion model trained on natural antibody sequences and developability data, incorporating a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) module to steer the sampling process towards biophysically viable antibody candidates.

Result: The model reproduces global features of natural and approved therapeutic antibodies in unconstrained sampling and demonstrates significant improvement in predicted developability scores with SVDD guidance.

Conclusion: This framework facilitates an iterative and ML-driven approach for the design of antibodies meeting both binding and biophysical requirements, offering a pipeline for more effective therapeutic antibody discovery.

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

*Francesco Di Salvo,Hanh Huyen My Nguyen,Christian Ledig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Differentially Private Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) for efficient and privacy-respecting data sharing in decentralized medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge addressed is the limited adoption of Deep Learning in medical imaging due to data scarcity and privacy concerns, which Federated Learning does not solve effectively due to high communication costs and limited task flexibility.

Method: The paper proposes using foundation models to extract compressed embeddings combined with a collaboratively trained DP-CVAE to model global privacy-constrained data distributions.

Result: The method enhances privacy, scalability, efficiency, and supports diverse tasks, outperforming traditional FL classifiers. It also produces higher-fidelity embeddings than DP-CGAN, with significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a promising direction for privacy-preserving data sharing in decentralized tasks, improving medical imaging DL through scalable and efficient collaborative learning.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

### [205] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Pricing in Supply Chains: Benchmarking Strategic Agent Behaviours under Realistically Simulated Market Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02698)
*Thomas Hazenberg,Yao Ma,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Marijn van Rijswijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to dynamic pricing in supply chains, showing MARL achieves competitive dynamics that static rules cannot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ERP systems fail to account for strategic interactions among market actors. The study aims to address this limitation by leveraging MARL in dynamic pricing strategies.

Method: Three MARL algorithms—MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX—were evaluated against static rule-based baselines using a simulated e-commerce environment informed by real transaction data and a LightGBM demand prediction model.

Result: Static rule-based approaches excelled in fairness (0.9896) and price stability (volatility: 0.024), but lacked competitive dynamics. MADQN showed aggressive pricing behavior with high volatility and low fairness, while MADDPG achieved a balanced trade-off between fairness, stability, and market competition.

Conclusion: MARL introduces strategic behavior absent in static pricing rules, offering valuable insights for advancing dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains.

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

### [206] [Fluid Democracy in Federated Data Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02710)
*Aditya Vema Reddy Kesari,Krishna Reddy Kesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances federated learning (FL) by identifying efficient client weight transfers using consensus-driven approaches, introducing a protocol (viscous-retained democracy) and a new algorithm (FedVRD) to handle adversaries and reduce costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in federated learning where all clients transfer weights to a central server, causing unnecessary data transfer costs, and to enhance resistance to adversarial attacks.

Method: The study explores fluid democracy protocols and proposes the viscous-retained democracy protocol to optimize weight transfers. It also presents an algorithm called FedVRD to minimize adversarial impacts and improve data transfer efficiency.

Result: The viscous-retained democracy protocol outperforms traditional and existing fluid democracy models. Additionally, FedVRD algorithm effectively counters adversaries while reducing data transfer costs in federated learning.

Conclusion: The proposed protocols and algorithm enhance the efficiency and robustness of federated learning systems by optimizing client weight transfers and limiting adversarial influences.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

### [207] [A Forget-and-Grow Strategy for Deep Reinforcement Learning Scaling in Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02712)
*Zilin Kang,Chenyuan Hu,Yu Luo,Zhecheng Yuan,Ruijie Zheng,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Forget and Grow (FoG), a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to address primacy bias in RL agents by forgetting early experiences and expanding network capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep reinforcement learning approaches often suffer from primacy bias, which limits sample efficiency and generalizability.

Method: The FoG algorithm introduces two mechanisms: (1) Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) to gradually reduce the impact of early experiences, and (2) Network Expansion to dynamically increase neural capacity during training.

Result: FoG demonstrated superior performance on over 40 tasks from four major continuous control benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

Conclusion: The biologically inspired Forget and Grow approach improves both the efficiency and adaptability of RL agents by mimicking processes of forgetting and growth observed in humans.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

*Omri Porat,Michael Fire,Eran Ben-Elia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a demand prediction framework for dockless e-scooters, integrating spatial, temporal, and network data to improve accuracy by 27-49%, aiding effective urban micromobility management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dockless e-scooters are eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives, but precise demand prediction is needed for optimizing fleet distribution and infrastructure planning.

Method: The study introduces a framework that combines spatial, temporal, and network dependencies to enhance micromobility demand forecasting accuracy.

Result: The proposed framework improves accuracy in demand prediction by 27 to 49% compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The framework provides actionable insights for better micromobility management, supporting sustainable urban planning and operational cost efficiency.

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

*Shiyi Liu,Buwen Liang,Yuetong Fang,Zixuan Jiang,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIPPO, a hierarchical contrastive learning framework for bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities and predicting protein-protein interactions across organisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in protein-protein interaction prediction, particularly in settings with sparse, imbalanced, or multi-species biological data.

Method: The framework leverages hierarchical contrastive learning, aligning protein sequences and hierarchical attributes through multi-tier biological representation matching, combined with a penalty mechanism for consistency enforcement.

Result: Experiments demonstrate HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, robustness in low-data regimes, and zero-shot transferability across species without retraining.

Conclusion: HIPPO provides a versatile and effective methodology for cross-species PPI prediction, aiding scenarios with limited experimental data while advancing biological representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 2-simplicial Transformer, improving token efficiency over standard Transformers by utilizing trilinear functions, which enhances performance in tasks like math, coding, reasoning, and logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern large language models are constrained by finite data supplies and are shifting away from being compute-bound, necessitating architectures that improve token efficiency.

Method: The authors propose the 2-simplicial Transformer, which generalizes dot-product attention to trilinear functions, and efficiently implements it using a Triton kernel.

Result: The 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency and improves performance in reasoning-related tasks. It modifies scaling laws' exponents compared to dot-product attention.

Conclusion: 2-simplicial attention is a promising alternative to dot-product attention, especially for tasks that benefit from improved token efficiency, offering a compelling direction for future model development.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

### [211] [Understanding and Improving Length Generalization in Recurrent Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02782)
*Ricardo Buitrago Ruiz,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses how recurrent models struggle with length generalization and proposes training strategies to tackle this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent models can theoretically handle arbitrarily long sequences but often fail to generalize beyond their training context lengths.

Method: The authors propose training interventions like initializing the model's state with Gaussian noise or using the final state of another input to expand the distribution of states the model encounters.

Result: With minimal post-training adjustments (~0.1% of the pre-training budget), models achieved robust length generalization for significantly longer sequences (e.g., from 2k to 128k).

Conclusion: Simple and efficient interventions can substantially improve the ability of recurrent models to generalize to long sequences, addressing a critical limitation in their deployment.

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

*Thiti Suttaket,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRADUATE addresses the issue of ensuring well-calibrated survival models for both population and minority subpopulations by employing a constrained optimization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibrated survival models are critical in healthcare to avoid erroneous clinical decisions, but existing models focus on population-level calibration, neglecting minority subpopulations.

Method: GRADUATE uses constrained optimization to achieve multicalibration, ensuring both calibration and discrimination during the training phase.

Result: Mathematical proofs show the method is near-optimal, and empirical tests on clinical datasets confirm GRADUATE's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: GRADUATE effectively solves the limitation of current survival models by balancing calibration and discrimination for all subpopulations, reducing risks in clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

TL;DR: This paper explores distribution testing within algorithmic replicability, introducing efficient algorithms and fundamental lower bounds for properties like testing uniformity and closeness in distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the challenges in establishing sample complexity for replicable distribution testing methods, which is vital for both theoretical insights and practical applications in machine learning and data analysis.

Method: The authors propose novel replicable algorithms for testing statistical properties (closeness and independence) of distributions and develop a method for proving sample complexity lower bounds, extending to near-optimal solutions for certain tests.

Result: The paper provides new algorithms for replicable distribution testing, a methodology for lower bound proofs, and achieves near-optimal sample complexity bounds for uniformity and closeness testing.

Conclusion: This research advances the understanding of replicable algorithms and their sample complexity, offering tools and insights critical for theoretical computer science and practical aspects of algorithm design.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the
framework of algorithmic replicability. Specifically, given independent samples
from a collection of probability distributions, the goal is to characterize the
sample complexity of replicably testing natural properties of the underlying
distributions. On the algorithmic front, we develop new replicable algorithms
for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

### [214] [LLM-Driven Treatment Effect Estimation Under Inference Time Text Confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02843)
*Yuchen Ma,Dennis Frauen,Jonas Schweisthal,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses biases in treatment effect estimation caused by incomplete textual data at inference time, proposing a robust framework utilizing language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a discrepancy between structured medical data used during training and incomplete textual descriptions at inference time, leading to biased treatment effect estimations.

Method: They formalized the text confounding issue at inference time and developed a framework combining large language models with a doubly robust learner to mitigate biases.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the framework's improved effectiveness and reliability in handling inference-time text confounding in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Accounting for inference-time text confounding and leveraging robust methodologies can notably enhance treatment effect estimation quality in personalized medicine.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects

*Kunyu Zhang,Qiang Li,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MvHo-IB, a novel framework for leveraging higher-order interactions in fMRI data to improve diagnostic systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of effectively extracting and utilizing higher-order interactions (HOIs) in fMRI data to enhance diagnostic accuracy in machine learning systems.

Method: The proposed MvHo-IB framework combines O-information from information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to quantify HOIs, employs a specialized Brain3DCNN encoder, and utilizes a multi-view learning information bottleneck objective for better representation learning.

Result: Experimental results on three benchmark fMRI datasets show that MvHo-IB outperforms existing methods, including recent hypergraph-based models, achieving state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that MvHo-IB effectively integrates HOIs and pairwise interactions, automatically filters redundant information, and establishes a new performance standard for fMRI diagnostic tasks.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is

### [216] [Quality Diversity Genetic Programming for Learning Scheduling Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02235)
*Meng Xu,Frank Neumann,Aneta Neumann,Yew Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization framework tailored to dynamic scheduling problems by mapping heuristic behaviors to explore diverse, high-performing solutions over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world optimization requires generating diverse, high-quality solutions, but current QD algorithms have limited focus on dynamic combinatorial optimization problems and lack theoretical exploration in learning heuristics.

Method: The authors propose a map-building strategy linking heuristic genotypes to their behaviors to visualize the solution space as a QD map, and apply this method to dynamic scheduling problems through experiments on fixed and dynamic training instances.

Result: The framework demonstrates the evolving nature of the QD map, showing how solutions distribute and adapt over time in dynamic problem settings.

Conclusion: The proposed QD framework offers a promising approach to discovering and maintaining diverse solutions for dynamic scheduling problems and highlights avenues for future research in applying QD algorithms to other dynamic optimization challenges.

Abstract: Real-world optimization often demands diverse, high-quality solutions.
Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization is a multifaceted approach in evolutionary
algorithms that aims to generate a set of solutions that are both
high-performing and diverse. QD algorithms have been successfully applied
across various domains, providing robust solutions by exploring diverse
behavioral niches. However, their application has primarily focused on static
problems, with limited exploration in the context of dynamic combinatorial
optimization problems. Furthermore, the theoretical understanding of QD
algorithms remains underdeveloped, particularly when applied to learning
heuristics instead of directly learning solutions in complex and dynamic
combinatorial optimization domains, which introduces additional challenges.
This paper introduces a novel QD framework for dynamic scheduling problems. We
propose a map-building strategy that visualizes the solution space by linking
heuristic genotypes to their behaviors, enabling their representation on a QD
map. This map facilitates the discovery and maintenance of diverse scheduling
heuristics. Additionally, we conduct experiments on both fixed and dynamically
changing training instances to demonstrate how the map evolves and how the
distribution of solutions unfolds over time. We also discuss potential future
research directions that could enhance the learning process and broaden the
applicability of QD algorithms to dynamic combinatorial optimization
challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the understanding of interactions between algorithm configurations and problem characteristics, especially to enhance configurability and interpretability.

Method: Performance footprints are computed for modular variants of CMA-ES and analyzed across dimensional settings on BBOB benchmark problems.

Result: The analysis reveals shared behavioral patterns across configurations and identifies divergent behaviors due to different problem features.

Conclusion: Algorithm footprints are effective tools for understanding algorithm behavior and guiding configuration decisions.

Abstract: This paper leverages the recently introduced concept of algorithm footprints
to investigate the interplay between algorithm configurations and problem
characteristics. Performance footprints are calculated for six modular variants
of the CMA-ES algorithm (modCMA), evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the
BBOB suite, across two-dimensional settings: 5-dimensional and 30-dimensional.
These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same
algorithm exhibit varying performance and identify the problem features
influencing these outcomes. Our analysis uncovers shared behavioral patterns
across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as
well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem
features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithm footprints in
enhancing interpretability and guiding configuration choices.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new cluster-based visualization method and metrics to analyze the dynamics of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visualization techniques fail to illustrate search dynamics effectively in high-dimensional or complex solution spaces.

Method: The paper proposes clustering solution candidates to track cluster memberships across iterations, along with metrics to measure algorithm stability and similarity.

Result: When applied to ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms, the methodology revealed insights into stability and comparative behaviors.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enhances understanding of search dynamics and offers tools for comparing and improving optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms
is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional
visualization techniques, such as convergence plots, trajectory mapping, and
fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural
dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex
solution spaces. To address this, we propose a novel representation and
visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the
algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations,
offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally,
we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to
quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual
algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We
apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms,
revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby
providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

*Han Huang,Tianyu Wang,Chaoda Peng,Tongli He,Zhifeng Hao*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an experimental approach for estimating upper bounds on the running time of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) in numerical optimization without simplifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in existing research for MOEAs, which often rely on algorithmic or problem simplifications, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: An experimental approach employing an average gain model and statistical methods is used to estimate gains via the Inverted Generational Distance metric, with an adaptive sampling method designed to ensure accurate running time estimation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on five MOEAs and standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating running time bounds without simplifications.

Conclusion: The work complements theoretical research by presenting a practical framework for running time analysis, supported by a web-based implementation for broader applicability.

Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become essential tools
for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), making their running
time analysis crucial for assessing algorithmic efficiency and guiding
practical applications. While significant theoretical advances have been
achieved for combinatorial optimization, existing studies for numerical
optimization primarily rely on algorithmic or problem simplifications, limiting
their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose an
experimental approach for estimating upper bounds on the running time of MOEAs
in numerical optimization without simplification assumptions. Our approach
employs an average gain model that characterizes algorithmic progress through
the Inverted Generational Distance metric. To handle the stochastic nature of
MOEAs, we use statistical methods to estimate the probabilistic distribution of
gains. Recognizing that gain distributions in numerical optimization exhibit
irregular patterns with varying densities across different regions, we
introduce an adaptive sampling method that dynamically adjusts sampling density
to ensure accurate surface fitting for running time estimation. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on five representative MOEAs (NSGA-II, MOEA/D,
AR-MOEA, AGEMOEA-II, and PREA) using the ZDT and DTLZ benchmark suites. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating upper
bounds on the running time without requiring algorithmic or problem
simplifications. Additionally, we provide a web-based implementation to
facilitate broader adoption of our methodology. This work provides a practical
complement to theoretical research on MOEAs in numerical optimization.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multiple-gain model that advances the theoretical analysis of $(\mu+\lambda)$ EA for combinatorial optimization problems, with tighter time complexity bounds and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of theoretical results for $(\mu+\lambda)$ EAs in combinatorial optimization compared to simpler pseudo-Boolean problems.

Method: Introduces a multiple-gain model, an improved version of the average gain model, leveraging fitness-difference drift under sigma-algebra conditions to analyze expected first hitting time.

Result: The new framework provides tighter upper bounds for knapsack problem (with correlated weights), traveling salesperson problem, and $k$-MAX-SAT problems. Experimental results confirm theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The multiple-gain model is effective for analyzing running time for $(\mu+\lambda)$ EAs in combinatorial contexts, offering both theoretical and practical alignment.

Abstract: The running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial optimization is a
fundamental topic in evolutionary computation. However, theoretical results
regarding the $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm (EA) for combinatorial
optimization problems remain relatively scarce compared to those for simple
pseudo-Boolean problems. This paper proposes a multiple-gain model to analyze
the running time of EAs for combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed
model is an improved version of the average gain model, which is a
fitness-difference drift approach under the sigma-algebra condition to estimate
the running time of evolutionary numerical optimization. The improvement yields
a framework for estimating the expected first hitting time of a stochastic
process in both average-case and worst-case scenarios. It also introduces novel
running-time results of evolutionary combinatorial optimization, including two
tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the knapsack problem with favorably correlated weights,
a closed-form expression of time complexity upper bound in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for general $k$-MAX-SAT problems and a tighter time
complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$)
EA for the traveling salesperson problem. Experimental results indicate that
the practical running time aligns with the theoretical results, verifying that
the multiple-gain model is an effective tool for running-time analysis of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for combinatorial optimization problems.

*Mohammad Akyash,Kimia Azar,Hadi Kamali*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Large language models often struggle with generating RTL code due to syntax and semantic demands. This paper introduces DecoRTL, a decoding strategy to address these issues, improving code validity and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models exhibit decoding failures in RTL code generation, such as invalid or repetitive outputs, due to their design limitations with structural and semantic complexities.

Method: The authors propose DecoRTL, a run-time decoding strategy featuring two components: self-consistency sampling to enhance correctness and diversity, and syntax-aware temperature adaptation to tailor sampling for syntax-critical versus exploratory tokens.

Result: Using the VerilogEval benchmark across multiple open-source LLMs, DecoRTL displayed substantial improvements in syntactic validity, functional correctness, and output diversity without perceptible performance overhead.

Conclusion: DecoRTL successfully addresses RTL code generation issues by refining decoding strategies at inference time, offering high-quality outputs without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: As one of their many applications, large language models (LLMs) have recently
shown promise in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation.
However, conventional LLM decoding strategies, originally designed for natural
language, often fail to meet the structural and semantic demands of RTL,
leading to hallucinated, repetitive, or invalid code outputs. In this paper, we
first investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an
empirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings
reveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or
semantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to
differentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)
and those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical
regions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time
decoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code
generation. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)
self-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks
them based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining
diversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies
tokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling
temperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens
and higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at
inference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we
demonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional
correctness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance
overhead) is imperceptible.

TL;DR: This paper studies user preferences for robot explanations during daily tasks and proposes algorithms for effective communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-robot interaction by addressing confusion caused by complex robot behaviors through effective explanations.

Method: User preference analysis for explanation timing and content during daily cleaning tasks, followed by algorithm development for robots using BDI reasoning.

Result: Users prefer concise explanations in surprising situations, specifying intention and relevant contextual factors. Algorithms were proposed for identifying such situations and crafting explanations.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms enhance understanding and interaction by making robot explanations context- and user-specific.

Abstract: When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives,
deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's
reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,
when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user
annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and
content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our
algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the
way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific
explanations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores a self-supervised learning method for robotic trajectory planning using recurrent architectures, addressing limitations of supervised imitation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient trajectory planning in robotics that overcomes the computational intensity of sampling-based planners and the imitative limitation of supervised learning approaches.

Method: A self-supervised learning scheme utilizing recurrent architectures to build trajectory models based on paired forward and inverse kinematics.

Result: The proposed model successfully generates trajectories and shows promise for handling more complex robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The method could enable adaptive and efficient trajectory planning in robotics beyond imitation-based approaches.

Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of
joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from
an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation
task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment.
Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are
computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning
can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often
requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural
architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised
approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on
whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce
observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a
cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent
architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of
the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The
results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only
using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that
this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks
requiring adaptive solutions.

Result: The proposed model shows competitive performance and strong transfer capabilities from simulated data to real robotic systems.

Conclusion: The approach offers an efficient and embodiment-agnostic solution for robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating its practical effectiveness through evaluation on simulated and real robots.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling
complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In
this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive
performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer
robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models
that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making
it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its
lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns
meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the
underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time
techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action
generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong
sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination
of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic

Method: Developed a symmetry-preserving sensor fusion pipeline using the invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) and introduced a novel heading correction mechanism leveraging GPS and IMU data.

Result: The algorithm was validated successfully on a customized Blue Robotics BlueBoat, achieving drift-free localization and improved yaw estimation.

Conclusion: The work offers an open-source solution, aiding accurate yaw observation and localization in challenging conditions, and serves as a foundation for further studies in sensor fusion.

Abstract: This paper presents an extension of the DRIFT invariant state estimation
framework, enabling robust fusion of GPS and IMU data for accurate pose and
heading estimation. Originally developed for testing and usage on a marine
autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), this approach can also be utilized on other
mobile systems. Building upon the original proprioceptive only DRIFT algorithm,
we develop a symmetry-preserving sensor fusion pipeline utilizing the invariant
extended Kalman filter (InEKF) to integrate global position updates from GPS
directly into the correction step. Crucially, we introduce a novel heading
correction mechanism that leverages GPS course-over-ground information in
conjunction with IMU orientation, overcoming the inherent unobservability of
yaw in dead-reckoning. The system was deployed and validated on a customized

Conclusion: The proposed simulator bridges the gap between cost efficiency and simulation accuracy, showing promise for enhancing automated driving controller validation and intelligent traffic solutions.

Abstract: Simulators are useful tools for testing automated driving controllers.
Vehicle-in-the-loop (ViL) tests and digital twins (DTs) are widely used
simulation technologies to facilitate the smooth deployment of controllers to

allow for saving space and expenses of simulation tests. The AI-powered DT
models ensure superior simulation fidelity. Moreover, the simulator integrates
well with off-the-shelf software and control algorithms, making it easy to
extend. We use a filtered control benchmark with formal safety guarantees to
showcase the capability of the simulator in validating automated driving

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current skeletonization and path-planning techniques are resource-intensive and mainly focus on image processing tasks, creating a gap for real-time, safe, and efficient navigation in mobile robotics.

Method: Proposed SkelUnet, a U-Net-based Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder, capable of one-shot sampling (OSS) to produce skeletonized navigation maps efficiently.

Result: Tested on 12,500 maps and evaluated on 250 unseen maps, SkelUnet demonstrated the ability to improve roadmap construction by connecting all free workspace regions, delivering safer paths, and reducing computation time.

Conclusion: SkelUnet provides an efficient and safe solution to path planning suitable for structured environments and mobile service robots, balancing response time, path length, and safety.

Abstract: Path planning algorithms aim to compute a collision-free path, and many works
focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable
for mobile service robots in structured environments.

TL;DR: This paper discusses creating a Digital Twin for a test area in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, featuring real-time traffic monitoring and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage digitalization for interconnected mobility systems by utilizing Digital Twin technology with real-real time interaction between virtual and physical environments.

Method: The Digital Twin was developed by digitally reconstructing the test area using data from V2X communication systems, camera images, and LiDAR sensors, enabling real-world traffic data integration.

Result: The developed Digital Twin successfully facilitates real-time simulations and its framework is made publicly available for real-world applications.

Conclusion: The digital reconstruction and simulation framework demonstrate Digital Twin's potential for traffic optimization and communication-related security simulations, highlighting its impactful applications.

Abstract: In the future, mobility will be strongly shaped by the increasing use of
digitalization. Not only will individual road users be highly interconnected,
but also the road and associated infrastructure. At that point, a Digital Twin
becomes particularly appealing because, unlike a basic simulation, it offers a
continuous, bilateral connection linking the real and virtual environments.
This paper describes the digital reconstruction used to develop the Digital
Twin of the Test Area Autonomous Driving-Baden-W\"urttemberg (TAF-BW), Germany.
The TAF-BW offers a variety of different road sections, from high-traffic urban
intersections and tunnels to multilane motorways. The test area is equipped
with a comprehensive Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication infrastructure
and multiple intelligent intersections equipped with camera sensors to
facilitate real-time traffic flow monitoring. The generation of authentic data
as input for the Digital Twin was achieved by extracting object lists at the
intersections. This process was facilitated by the combined utilization of
camera images from the intelligent infrastructure and LiDAR sensors mounted on
a test vehicle. Using a unified interface, recordings from real-world
detections of traffic participants can be resimulated. Additionally, the
simulation framework's design and the reconstruction process is discussed. The
resulting framework is made publicly available for download and utilization at:
https://digit4taf-bw.fzi.de The demonstration uses two case studies to
illustrate the application of the digital twin and its interfaces: the analysis
of traffic signal systems to optimize traffic flow and the simulation of
security-related scenarios in the communications sector.

*Maryem Fadili,Mohamed Anis Ghaoui,Louis Lecrosnier,Steve Pechberti,Redouane Khemmar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel late-fusion framework for collaborative 3D perception in autonomous driving, addressing limitations like high bandwidth requirements and proprietary model restrictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving perception systems face constraints like high communication bandwidth requirements and lack of access to proprietary detection model details, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: The authors propose a late collaborative fusion framework that uses shared 3D bounding box attributes (e.g., category, size, position, orientation) instead of requiring direct access to detection models.

Result: The framework reduces position error by up to 5x, scale error by 7.5x, and orientation error by half, while achieving 100% precision and recall in fusing heterogeneous perception systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework sets a new benchmark in late fusion for collaborative 3D perception, offering efficient and scalable solutions for real-world autonomous driving challenges.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on
collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of
individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy,
they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to
each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These
constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where
communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder
practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late
collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which
operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position,
and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our
framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to
five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it
reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while
maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from
heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges,
setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.

*Shivam Chaubey,Francesco Verdoja,Shankar Deka,Ville Kyrki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a shared control framework using Constrained Optimal Control Problem, improving user intent incorporation, feasibility, and safety across various real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance shared control systems which struggle with unpredictability of user inputs, safety, scalability, and feasibility issues in existing methods.

Method: The authors propose a framework based on Constrained Optimal Control Problem with Control Invariant Set, ensuring strict constraint satisfaction and minimal user intent overrides, even for non-convex constraints.

Result: A large-scale user study with 66 participants demonstrated improvements in user experience, trust, task load, and performance without compromising safety or user intent.

Conclusion: The proposed shared control framework effectively balances user intent and safety, establishing better scalability and reliability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Shared control combines human intention with autonomous decision-making, from
low-level safety overrides to high-level task guidance, enabling systems that
adapt to users while ensuring safety and performance. This enhances task
effectiveness and user experience across domains such as assistive robotics,
teleoperation, and autonomous driving. However, existing shared control
methods, based on e.g. Model Predictive Control, Control Barrier Functions, or
learning-based control, struggle with feasibility, scalability, or safety
guarantees, particularly since the user input is unpredictable.
  To address these challenges, we propose an assistive controller framework
based on Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates an
offline-computed Control Invariant Set, enabling online computation of control
actions that ensure feasibility, strict constraint satisfaction, and minimal
override of user intent. Moreover, the framework can accommodate structured
class of non-convex constraints, which are common in real-world scenarios. We
validate the approach through a large-scale user study with 66
participants--one of the most extensive in shared control research--using a
computer game environment to assess task load, trust, and perceived control, in
addition to performance. The results show consistent improvements across all
these aspects without compromising safety and user intent.

*Xiang Zhou,Xinyu Zhang,Qingrui Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a hierarchical learning framework for quadruped locomotion that improves compliance without sacrificing robustness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring robust and compliant locomotion in quadrupeds under unforeseen disturbances remains a challenge, as current methods often prioritize robustness, leading to energy inefficiency and stiff motion.

Method: A two-stage hierarchical learning framework is proposed. Stage one trains a velocity-tracking policy and a force estimator. Stage two adds a compliance action module based on impedance control to adjust velocity commands using real-time force estimates.

Result: Simulations and real-world experiments show the method improves robustness, energy efficiency, and safety, outperforming existing RL-based controllers. Ablation studies highlight the importance of the compliance action module.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully balances robustness and compliance in quadruped locomotion under disturbances, advancing current state-of-the-art methods in performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite recent remarkable achievements in quadruped control, it remains
challenging to ensure robust and compliant locomotion in the presence of
unforeseen external disturbances. Existing methods prioritize locomotion
robustness over compliance, often leading to stiff, high-frequency motions, and
energy inefficiency. This paper, therefore, presents a two-stage hierarchical
learning framework that can learn to take active reactions to external force
disturbances based on force estimation. In the first stage, a velocity-tracking
policy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical
proprioceptive features. A neural network-based estimator is learned through
supervised learning, which estimates body velocity and external forces based on
proprioceptive measurements. In the second stage, a compliance action module,
inspired by impedance control, is learned based on the pre-trained encoder and
policy. This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in
response to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the
compliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor
disturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking
a balance between robustness and compliance. Simulations and real-world
experiments have demonstrated that our method has superior performance in terms
of robustness, energy efficiency, and safety. Experiment comparison shows that
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based locomotion controllers.
Ablation studies are given to show the critical roles of the compliance action
module.

Motivation: To address challenges in actuation and control by leveraging under-actuated and compliant robotic systems.

Method: Designing a quadrupedal robot (Flix-Walker) with helix-shaped legs actuated via vibration, supported by simulations and prototype experiments.

Result: Three mobility modes were demonstrated, alongside robust trajectory-tracking and navigation using optimized control parameters.

Conclusion: Flix-Walker performs reliably across varied conditions, showcasing potential for compliant under-actuated robotics.

Abstract: Under-actuated compliant robotic systems offer a promising approach to
mitigating actuation and control challenges by harnessing pre-designed,
embodied dynamic behaviors. This paper presents Flix-Walker, a novel,
untethered, centimeter-scale quadrupedal robot inspired by compliant
under-actuated mechanisms. Flix-Walker employs flexible, helix-shaped beams as
legs, which are actuated by vibrations from just two motors to achieve three
distinct mobility modes. We analyze the actuation parameters required to
generate various locomotion modes through both simulation and prototype
experiments. The effects of system and environmental variations on locomotion
performance are examined, and we propose a generic metric for selecting control
parameters that produce robust and functional motions. Experiments validate the
effectiveness and robustness of these actuation parameters within a closed-loop
control framework, demonstrating reliable trajectory-tracking and
self-navigation capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper presents ArtGS, a framework using visual-physical modeling and 3D Gaussian Splatting for better manipulation and understanding of articulated objects. It achieves significant improvements in accuracy and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of articulated object manipulation in robotics, which is hindered by complex kinematics and limited physical reasoning of existing methods.

Method: ArtGS employs multi-view RGB-D reconstruction, reasoning via a vision-language model for semantics and structure, and parameter optimization using dynamic, differentiable 3D Gaussian Splatting-based rendering.

Result: ArtGS achieves superior joint estimation accuracy and manipulation success rates in both simulated and real-world environments, outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: ArtGS provides a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for articulated object modeling and manipulation, enhancing adaptability and motion constraint consistency.

Abstract: Articulated object manipulation remains a critical challenge in robotics due
to the complex kinematic constraints and the limited physical reasoning of
existing methods. In this work, we introduce ArtGS, a novel framework that
extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by integrating visual-physical modeling
for articulated object understanding and interaction. ArtGS begins with
multi-view RGB-D reconstruction, followed by reasoning with a vision-language
model (VLM) to extract semantic and structural information, particularly the
articulated bones. Through dynamic, differentiable 3DGS-based rendering, ArtGS
optimizes the parameters of the articulated bones, ensuring physically
consistent motion constraints and enhancing the manipulation policy. By
leveraging dynamic Gaussian splatting, cross-embodiment adaptability, and
closed-loop optimization, ArtGS establishes a new framework for efficient,
scalable, and generalizable articulated object modeling and manipulation.
Experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments
demonstrate that ArtGS significantly outperforms previous methods in joint
estimation accuracy and manipulation success rates across a variety of
articulated objects. Additional images and videos are available on the project

*Ananya Rao,Alyssa Hargis,David Wettergreen,Howie Choset*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to optimize starting locations for heterogeneous robot teams in disaster response scenarios, showing improved performance in coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of strategies for determining the starting locations of robotic teams in disaster scenarios, where effective deployment is critical.

Method: The paper introduces a joint optimization framework with a constraint in the ergodic optimization process to assign starting locations, particularly for heterogeneous robots. The method uses potential locations derived from expert knowledge or aerial imagery.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves coverage performance by 35.98% on synthetic data and 31.91% on real-world data compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that optimizing starting locations using this framework enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of robotic disaster response teams.

Abstract: In disaster response scenarios, deploying robotic teams effectively is
crucial for improving situational awareness and enhancing search and rescue
operations. The use of robots in search and rescue has been studied but the
question of where to start robot deployments has not been addressed. This work
addresses the problem of optimally selecting starting locations for robots with
heterogeneous capabilities by formulating a joint optimization problem. To
determine start locations, this work adds a constraint to the ergodic
optimization framework whose minimum assigns robots to start locations. This
becomes a little more challenging when the robots are heterogeneous (equipped
with different sensing and motion modalities) because not all robots start at
the same location, and a more complex adaptation of the aforementioned
constraint is applied. Our method assumes access to potential starting
locations, which can be obtained from expert knowledge or aerial imagery. We
experimentally evaluate the efficacy of our joint optimization approach by
comparing it to baseline methods that use fixed starting locations for all
robots. Our experimental results show significant gains in coverage
performance, with average improvements of 35.98% on synthetic data and 31.91%
on real-world data for homogeneous and heterogeneous teams, in terms of the
ergodic metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in planning efficient and feasible motion paths for differential drive mobile manipulators, which face issues such as nonholonomic constraints and collision avoidance.

Method: The method involves a hierarchical pipeline: 1) determining collision-free, topologically distinct base paths, 2) sampling and optimizing whole-body trajectories in parallel, and 3) using polynomial trajectories and arc length-yaw parameterization to handle nonholonomic dynamics.

Result: The proposed approach efficiently identifies feasible and optimal motion trajectories for differential drive mobile manipulators.

Conclusion: The hierarchical pipeline is effective in addressing both collision avoidance and nonholonomic constraints, ensuring optimal whole-body motion planning.

Abstract: We present an efficient hierarchical motion planning pipeline for
differential drive mobile manipulators. Our approach first searches for
multiple collisionfree and topologically distinct paths for the mobile base to
extract the space in which optimal solutions may exist. Further sampling and
optimization are then conducted in parallel to explore feasible whole-body
trajectories. For trajectory optimization, we employ polynomial trajectories
and arc length-yaw parameterization, enabling efficient handling of the
nonholonomic dynamics while ensuring optimality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiGen, a framework for improving multisensory simulation in robotics by incorporating generative models into physics simulators, facilitating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of integrating multisensory modalities like sound and vision for real-world robotic tasks, which is difficult due to limitations in simulators.

Method: The authors introduce MultiGen, combining generative models with high-fidelity physics simulators to synthesize audiovisual data necessary for training multimodal robotic skills.

Result: MultiGen effectively enables zero-shot transfer of robotic pouring skills with novel containers and liquids to real-world scenarios, demonstrating enhanced multimodal sim-to-real performance.

Conclusion: Generative models can successfully simulate complex sensory modalities and help close the sim-to-real gap in multimodal robotics applications.

Abstract: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the
real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains
challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has
benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be
notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has
succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still
largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing
MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into
traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase
our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on
multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation
video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without
any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world
pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of
generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the
multimodal sim-to-real gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aspiring software engineers face challenges in preparing for technical interviews due to their complexity and lack of focus in educational curricula.

Method: The authors conducted a survey with 131 candidates actively preparing for technical interviews to understand preparation methods, challenges, and educational support.

Result: Candidates seldom train in realistic settings, and educational courses often fail to provide adequate preparation, leading to stress and unpreparedness.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for better support and resources to improve technical interview preparation for aspiring software engineers.

Abstract: To obtain employment, aspiring software engineers must complete technical
interviews -- a hiring process which involves candidates writing code while
communicating to an audience. However, the complexities of tech interviews are
difficult to prepare for and seldom faced in computing curricula. To this end,
we seek to understand how candidates prepare for technical interviews,
investigating the effects of preparation methods and the role of education. We
distributed a survey to candidates (n = 131) actively preparing for technical
interviews. Our results suggest candidates rarely train in authentic settings
and courses fail to support preparation efforts -- leading to stress and

*Ben Limpanukorn,Yanjun Wang,Zach Patterson,Pranav Garg,Murali Krishna Ramanathan,Xiaofei Ma,Anoop Deoras,Miryung Kim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new approach to code search by combining the reasoning capabilities of a large language model (LLM) with structural search tools to allow developers to query using natural language for better precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers currently rely on keyword and regex-based search methods, alongside structural code search tools that require domain-specific languages (DSLs). These DSLs are difficult to learn, creating a usability barrier, which this research aims to overcome by using natural language input for structural code search.

Method: The method integrates the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for interpreting natural language queries with structural code search tools. It is implemented for two specific DSLs, Semgrep and GQL, and evaluated on a new benchmark of 400 queries across 10 Java projects.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated high precision and recall (55%-70%). It outperformed baseline methods like semantic code search and LLM retrieval by up to 57% and 14% on F1 scores.

Conclusion: Using natural language queries for structural code search is effective and lowers the barrier to entry, offering superior performance to traditional approaches based on existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Searching code is a common task that developers perform to understand APIs,
learn common code patterns, and navigate code. Currently, developers most
commonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and
widely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code
search tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic
structure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to
systematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools
operate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be
difficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural
language to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural
language provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to
entry.
  In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning
capabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the
power of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve
relevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search
DSLs: Semgrep and GQL. In our evaluation, we construct a new benchmark for
structural code search consisting of 400 queries over 10 Java projects. We show
that our approach for structural code search based on translating NL queries to
DSL queries using an LLM is effective and robust, achieving a high precision
and recall ranging from 55% - 70%. Further, our approach significantly
outperforms baselines based on semantic code search and LLM retrievals by up to
57% and 14% on F1 scores.

TL;DR: This research examines whether internal software metrics from source code can predict mobile app popularity. It achieves moderate success with classification models, despite poor performance in regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if internal software metrics from source code can predict mobile app popularity, providing a strategic advantage for developers in a competitive marketplace.

Method: The study uses a dataset of 446 open-source Android apps, extracting metrics like code complexity, code smells, and metadata. It evaluates regression and classification models based on various feature sets, including Size-only, Handpicked, and Voting features.

Result: Regression models performed poorly due to skewed data, but classification models showed significant improvement. The best classification model, a Multilayer Perceptron using Voting features, achieved an F1-score of 0.72.

Conclusion: Internal code metrics, although limited, show potential as indicators of app popularity, contradicting earlier findings dismissing their predictive value on software quality.

Abstract: Predicting mobile app popularity before release can provide developers with a
strategic advantage in a competitive marketplace, yet it remains a challenging
problem. This study explores whether internal software metrics, measurable from
source code before deployment, can predict an app's popularity, defined by user
ratings (calculated from user reviews) and DownloadsPerYear (yearly downloads).
Using a dataset of 446 open-source Android apps from F-Droid, we extract a wide
array of features, including system-, class-, and method-level code metrics,
code smells, and app metadata. Additional information, such as user reviews,
download counts, and uses-permission, was collected from the Google Play Store.
We evaluate regression and classification models across three feature sets: a
minimal Size-only baseline, a domain-informed Handpicked set, and a Voting set
derived via feature selection algorithms. Regression models perform poorly due
to skewed data, with low $R^2$ scores. However, when reframed as binary
classification (Popular vs. Unpopular), results improve significantly. The best
model, a Multilayer Perceptron using the Voting set, achieves F1-scores of
0.72. These results suggest that internal code metrics, although limited in
their explanatory power, can serve as useful indicators of app popularity. This
challenges earlier findings that dismissed internal metrics as predictors of
software quality.

Method: Participants completed surveys, programmed tasks while monitored by biometric sensors, and participated in interviews. The study compared self-reported and biometric indicators of stress.

Result: Psychometric tools detected no stress, while biometric data (EDA phasic peaks) showed significant differences. Participants gave mixed reports on stress in interviews.

Conclusion: Imposing stricter time limits was insufficient for inducing stress. The study provides methodological recommendations for future research on stress assessment using biometrics and psychometric tools.

Abstract: The study of well-being, stress and other human factors has traditionally
relied on self-report instruments to assess key variables. However, concerns
about potential biases in these instruments, even when thoroughly validated and
standardised, have driven growing interest in alternatives in combining these
measures with more objective methods, such as physiological measures.
  We aimed to (i) compare psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators
and (ii) identify stress-related patterns in biometric data during software
engineering tasks.
  We conducted an experiment where participants completed a pre-survey, then
programmed two tasks wearing biometric sensors, answered brief post-surveys for
each, and finally went through a short exit interview.
  Our results showed diverse outcomes; we found no stress in the psychometric
instruments. Participants in the interviews reported a mix of feeling no stress
and experiencing time pressure. Finally, the biometrics showed a significant
difference only in EDA phasic peaks.
  We conclude that our chosen way of inducing stress by imposing a stricter
time limit was insufficient. We offer methodological insights for future
studies working with stress, biometrics, and psychometric instruments.

### [246] [Towards Trustworthy Sentiment Analysis in Software Engineering: Dataset Characteristics and Tool Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02137)
*Martin Obaidi,Marc Herrmann,Jil Klünder,Kurt Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the variability in sentiment analysis tool performance across developer communication datasets and proposes an approach to recommend suitable tools based on dataset characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inconsistent performance of existing sentiment analysis tools when applied to diverse datasets, limiting their utility in understanding team dynamics and improving analytics in software engineering.

Method: The study analyzed linguistic and statistical properties of 10 developer communication datasets from five platforms, evaluated 14 sentiment analysis tools, and proposed a mapping approach and questionnaire for recommending suitable tools based on dataset features.

Result: The research found significant differences in linguistic and statistical properties across platforms, with transformer-based models like SetFit and RoBERTa providing consistently strong results, though effectiveness remained context-dependent.

Conclusion: The proposed approach aids researchers and practitioners in selecting appropriate sentiment analysis tools for varied contexts in software engineering, emphasizing the need for continuous tool evaluation as communication styles evolve.

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on text-based communication, making
sentiment analysis a valuable tool for understanding team dynamics and
supporting trustworthy AI-driven analytics in requirements engineering.
However, existing sentiment analysis tools often perform inconsistently across
datasets from different platforms, due to variations in communication style and
content.
  In this study, we analyze linguistic and statistical features of 10 developer
communication datasets from five platforms and evaluate the performance of 14
sentiment analysis tools. Based on these results, we propose a mapping approach
and questionnaire that recommends suitable sentiment analysis tools for new
datasets, using their characteristic features as input.
  Our results show that dataset characteristics can be leveraged to improve
tool selection, as platforms differ substantially in both linguistic and
statistical properties. While transformer-based models such as SetFit and
RoBERTa consistently achieve strong results, tool effectiveness remains
context-dependent. Our approach supports researchers and practitioners in
selecting trustworthy tools for sentiment analysis in software engineering,
while highlighting the need for ongoing evaluation as communication contexts
evolve.

### [247] [Enhancing COBOL Code Explanations: A Multi-Agents Approach Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02182)
*Fangjian Lei,Jiawen Liu,Shayan Noei,Ying Zou,Derek Truong,William Alexander*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of maintaining COBOL codebases due to declining developer availability and lack of documentation by proposing a multi-agent approach using language models to improve code explanation, especially for large files beyond token window limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining COBOL systems is increasingly hard because of its legacy nature, complexity, and shrinking developer base, compounded by poor documentation. Existing language model solutions struggle with COBOL’s unique challenges like large file sizes and syntax.

Method: The proposed method uses a multi-agent system where two LLM-based agents collaborate to enhance explanations for COBOL functions, files, and projects. Contextual information from the codebase is incorporated to improve prompts.

Result: The method demonstrated significant performance gains over baselines: improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% respectively on function-level metrics like METEOR and SentenceBERT, and also excelled at explaining long files and projects.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses documentation challenges in COBOL systems by generating clearer and more functional explanations, outperforming baselines at function, file, and project levels, including for lengthy COBOL files.

Abstract: Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to
develop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business,
and government agencies. Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of
COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly
challenging. In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for
new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems. Existing
research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of
code snippets. However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its
architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed
the token window size of LLMs. In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach
that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate
explanations for functions, files, and the overall project. These agents
incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into
the code explanation prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach
using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects. Our results indicate that our
approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code
explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR,
chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively. At the file level, our approach
effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token
window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in
explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated
explanation. At the project level, our approach generates explanations that
convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.

*Chung-ju Huang,Ziqi Zhang,Yinggui Wang,Binghui Wang,Tao Wei,Leye Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, VeFIA, to ensure the correctness of inference software in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) without compromising privacy or adding latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) systems lack mechanisms to audit whether the inference software of a data party executes correctly, which may compromise correctness and reliability.

Method: The authors propose the VeFIA framework, which uses a combination of Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and a central coordinator to audit the computation outputs of a data party during inference without introducing latency or violating data privacy.

Result: VeFIA successfully detects anomalies in inference software execution. It guarantees a detection probability of 99.99% if the abnormal inference rate exceeds 5.4% and achieves a 100% accuracy rate across various validation metrics.

Conclusion: VeFIA ensures reliable auditing for VFL inference execution while maintaining privacy and operational efficiency. This is the first work to address inference correctness in VFL environments.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a distributed AI software deployment
mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data.
However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness
of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design
a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task
party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as
expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the
data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core
of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework
with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the
correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as
long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect
execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%,
without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random
sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness
of inference software execution in VFL.

### [249] [Precisely Detecting Python Type Errors via LLM-based Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02318)
*Chen Yang,Ziqi Wang,Yanjie Jiang,Lin Yang,Yuteng Zheng,Jianyi Zhou,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RTED improves Python type error detection using type-aware test generation and reduces false positives compared to existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for Python type error detection either generate high false positives or lack focused guidance for identifying bugs.

Method: RTED employs step-by-step type constraint analysis with reflective validation to guide test generation and suppress false positives.

Result: RTED detects 22-29 more type errors than existing methods, improves precision by 173.9%-245.9%, and identifies 12 new type errors in real-world Python projects.

Conclusion: RTED enhances software reliability by addressing limitations of current tools and offering a practical solution for accurate Python type error detection.

Abstract: Type errors in Python often lead to runtime failures, posing significant
challenges to software reliability and developer productivity. Existing static
analysis tools aim to detect such errors without execution but frequently
suffer from high false positive rates. Recently, unit test generation
techniques offer great promise in achieving high test coverage, but they often
struggle to produce bug-revealing tests without tailored guidance. To address
these limitations, we present RTED, a novel type-aware test generation
technique for automatically detecting Python type errors. Specifically, RTED
combines step-by-step type constraint analysis with reflective validation to
guide the test generation process and effectively suppress false positives. We
evaluated RTED on two widely-used benchmarks, BugsInPy and TypeBugs.
Experimental results show that RTED can detect 22-29 more benchmarked type
errors than four state-of-the-art techniques. RTED is also capable of producing
fewer false positives, achieving an improvement of 173.9%-245.9% in precision.
Furthermore, RTED successfully discovered 12 previously unknown type errors
from six real-world open-source Python projects.

### [250] [Meta-Fair: AI-Assisted Fairness Testing of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02533)
*Miguel Romero-Arjona,José A. Parejo,Juan C. Alonso,Ana B. Sánchez,Aitor Arrieta,Sergio Segura*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Meta-Fair, an automated method for fairness testing in large language models (LLMs) using metamorphic testing and LLM capabilities for test generation and evaluation. Tests on multiple LLMs highlight its effectiveness in detecting bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness evaluation methods for LLMs are resource-intensive, rely heavily on manual interventions, and are difficult to scale. The paper seeks to establish an automated, scalable approach to fairness testing in LLMs.

Method: The authors utilize metamorphic testing, where controlled input variations are analyzed for bias, and leverage LLM capabilities for generating test cases and evaluating outputs. They introduce three open-source tools for test generation, execution, and evaluation.

Result: Experiments using 12 LLMs, 14 metamorphic relations, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K test cases revealed that Meta-Fair achieved 92% average precision and uncovered bias in 29% of test executions. LLM evaluators achieved F1-scores up to 0.79, though some non-deterministic behavior was observed.

Conclusion: Meta-Fair demonstrates effective bias detection in LLMs with high precision and reliability. While some challenges, such as non-determinism and broader applicability, remain, the framework highlights significant steps toward automated fairness testing in LLMs.

Abstract: Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the
development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult
to assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language
models (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic
heuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult
to scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method
for testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific
resources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,
Meta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to
uncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled
modifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,
we propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and
output evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and
classify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source
tools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test
cases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained
LLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.
The results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,
achieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of
executions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,
with the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although
non-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through
careful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the
results indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation
in LLM testing.

### [251] [LLMREI: Automating Requirements Elicitation Interviews with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02564)
*Alexander Korn,Samuel Gorsch,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLMREI, a chatbot for conducting requirements elicitation interviews, showing its potential to reduce interviewer errors, extract requirements, and adaptively generate context-dependent questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Requirements elicitation interviews often require skilled analysts, which can introduce errors, biases, and resource intensiveness. This motivates exploring automation to alleviate these issues.

Method: The study developed LLMREI using zero-shot and least-to-most prompting approaches and tested it in 33 simulated interviews. Fine-tuning was abandoned due to poor preliminary results.

Result: LLMREI performed comparably to human interviewers in error rates, extracted a significant portion of requirements, and showed strong adaptability in context-dependent questioning.

Conclusion: LLMREI demonstrates potential to automate stakeholder interviews effectively, especially in scenarios involving a large number of stakeholders.

Abstract: Requirements elicitation interviews are crucial for gathering system
requirements but heavily depend on skilled analysts, making them
resource-intensive, susceptible to human biases, and prone to miscommunication.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models present new opportunities for
automating parts of this process. This study introduces LLMREI, a chat bot
designed to conduct requirements elicitation interviews with minimal human
intervention, aiming to reduce common interviewer errors and improve the
scalability of requirements elicitation. We explored two main approaches,
zero-shot prompting and least-to-most prompting, to optimize LLMREI for
requirements elicitation and evaluated its performance in 33 simulated
stakeholder interviews. A third approach, fine-tuning, was initially considered
but abandoned due to poor performance in preliminary trials. Our study assesses
the chat bot's effectiveness in three key areas: minimizing common interview
errors, extracting relevant requirements, and adapting its questioning based on
interview context and user responses. Our findings indicate that LLMREI makes a
similar number of errors compared to human interviewers, is capable of
extracting a large portion of requirements, and demonstrates a notable ability
to generate highly context-dependent questions. We envision the greatest
benefit of LLMREI in automating interviews with a large number of stakeholders.

### [252] [Human-Machine Collaboration and Ethical Considerations in Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02578)
*Zoe Pfister*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enhancing adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) by integrating Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) for seamless collaboration, while addressing the challenges of human-machine feedback loop synchronization, privacy, and ethical considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive CPS systems need to integrate humans effectively into their feedback loops to achieve seamless collaboration; however, challenges exist due to differences in operational cadences, privacy concerns, and respecting human values.

Method: The study proposes designing new methods for integrating human-machine interaction principles into CPS feedback loops and creating frameworks for considering ethics and human values throughout the system lifecycle, starting from requirements engineering.

Result: New processes and frameworks are developed to harmonize human-machine synchrony in adaptive CPS while ensuring privacy, ethical compliance, and human value considerations.

Conclusion: Integrating HMT into adaptive CPS is feasible by addressing both technical and ethical challenges, enabling advanced and value-aligned human-machine collaboration.

Abstract: Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that integrate both
physical and computational capabilities, which can adjust in response to
changing parameters. Furthermore, they increasingly incorporate human-machine
collaboration, allowing them to benefit from the individual strengths of humans
and machines. Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) represents the most advanced paradigm
of human-machine collaboration, envisioning seamless teamwork between humans
and machines. However, achieving effective and seamless HMT in adaptive CPS is
challenging. While adaptive CPS already benefit from feedback loops such as
MAPE-K, there is still a gap in integrating humans into these feedback loops
due to different operational cadences of humans and machines. Further, HMT
requires constant monitoring of human operators, collecting potentially
sensitive information about their actions and behavior. Respecting the privacy
and human values of the actors of the CPS is crucial for the success of
human-machine teams. This research addresses these challenges by: (1)
developing novel methods and processes for integrating HMT into adaptive CPS,
focusing on human-machine interaction principles and their incorporation into
adaptive feedback loops found in CPS, and (2) creating frameworks for
integrating, verifying, and validating ethics and human values throughout the
system lifecycle, starting from requirements engineering.

TL;DR: The study explores communication challenges between Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and Software Engineering Researchers (SERs) due to differing terminologies, proposing a framework for mutual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address communication barriers caused by differing terminologies between RSE and SER communities, which can hinder collaboration and progress.

Method: The authors use a systematic methodology for mapping terminologies from the SER community to how they are understood within the RSE community to identify commonalities, gaps, and areas of adaptation.

Result: Initial findings highlight opportunities for both communities to learn from each other and suggest a structured approach to aligning terminologies.

Conclusion: The study sets the stage for a collaborative effort to harmonize terminologies using a crowd-sourced validation process, potentially improving mutual understanding and cooperation.

Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and
Software Engineering Researchers (SERs) often use different terminologies for
similar concepts, creating communication challenges. To better understand these
divergences, we have started investigating how SE fundamentals from the SER
community are interpreted within the RSE community, identifying aligned
concepts, knowledge gaps, and areas for potential adaptation. Our preliminary
findings reveal opportunities for mutual learning and collaboration, and our
systematic methodology for terminology mapping provides a foundation for a
crowd-sourced extension and validation in the future.

### [254] [RLHGNN: Reinforcement Learning-driven Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Next Activity Prediction in Business Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02690)
*Jiaxing Wang,Yifeng Yu,Jiahan Song,Bin Cao,Jing Fan,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents RLHGNN, a framework for predicting activities in business processes using reinforcement learning and heterogeneous graph neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sequence-based and graph-based methods for activity prediction fail to effectively model complex business processes due to their inability to account for non-sequential relationships and process complexity.

Method: The authors propose RLHGNN, which transforms event logs into heterogeneous process graphs with three edge types. Reinforcement learning is applied to determine the optimal graph structure for each process instance, which is then modeled using heterogeneous graph convolution.

Result: RLHGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting next activities across six real-world datasets. It has an inference latency of approximately 1 ms, suitable for real-time applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework adapts to process complexities using heterogeneous graph representations and reinforcement learning, providing a highly efficient and accurate solution for business process activity prediction.

Abstract: Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing
business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices
environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which
enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite
the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture
non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and
conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural
preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static
structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual
process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce
RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process
graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining
theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively
combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and
employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to
automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process
instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with
relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next
activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential
and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive
evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference
latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical
solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The

*Sahar Ahmadisakha,Lech Bialek,Mohamed Soliman,Vasilios Andrikopoulos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study develops 'sustainability flags' for identifying sustainability discussions in cloud architecture posts, showing improved performance and usability compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author wants to address the challenge of identifying sustainability concepts in software practitioners' discussions, especially in the context of cloud architectures.

Method: Thematic analysis was conducted on sustainability best practices from cloud providers to create 'sustainability flags.' These flags were evaluated via a controlled experiment analyzing cloud architecture-related posts.

Result: Sustainability flags led to fewer posts being classified as sustainability-related, but with improved classification certainty and performance. They were also considered more useful and understandable compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The introduction of sustainability flags provides a practical and effective way to identify sustainability discussions within software practitioners' forums, particularly for cloud architectures.

Abstract: In recent years, sustainability in software systems has gained significant
attention, especially with the rise of cloud computing and the shift towards
cloud-based architectures. This shift has intensified the need to identify
sustainability in architectural discussions to take informed architectural
decisions. One source to see these decisions is in online Q&A forums among
practitioners' discussions. However, recognizing sustainability concepts within
software practitioners' discussions remains challenging due to the lack of
clear and distinct guidelines for this task. To address this issue, we
introduce the notion of sustainability flags as pointers in relevant
discussions, developed through thematic analysis of multiple sustainability
best practices from cloud providers. This study further evaluates the
effectiveness of these flags in identifying sustainability within cloud
architecture posts, using a controlled experiment. Preliminary results suggest
that the use of flags results in classifying fewer posts as
sustainability-related compared to a control group, with moderately higher
certainty and significantly improved performance. Moreover, sustainability
flags are perceived as more useful and understandable than relying solely on
definitions for identifying sustainability.

### [256] [Legal Requirements Translation from Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02846)
*Anmol Singhal,Travis Breaux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new automated method for extracting and representing legal text as Python code to help software comply with regulations, achieving high test accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of helping software systems comply with legal regulations, especially for small organizations without dedicated legal expertise. Current approaches for extracting metadata from legal texts have limitations, including the lack of consideration for interrelationships among attributes and reliance on manual processes or heuristic methods that lack generalizability.

Method: The paper proposes a novel approach using textual entailment and in-context learning to automatically generate a canonical Python representation of legal text. This representation is built upon a manually designed domain-specific Python class metamodel that captures both structural and semantic metadata, as well as their interrelationships. This approach reduces dependency on manually labeled datasets and improves adaptability to new regulations.

Result: The approach was evaluated using 13 U.S. state data breach notification laws, achieving approximately 89.4% success in generating correct representations, with precision of 82.2% and recall of 88.7%.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves the extraction and representation of legal metadata for compliance purposes, reducing manual efforts and increasing generalizability, particularly benefiting small organizations and startups.

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

TL;DR: The study explores using GPT-4 to generate real-time follow-up questions during requirements elicitation interviews and demonstrates its comparable or better performance than human-authored questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by challenges in effective interviewing, such as excessive cognitive load, domain unfamiliarity, and difficulty processing stakeholder speech, which LLMs can potentially address.

Method: The researchers evaluated GPT-4's ability to generate interview questions through two controlled experiments: one comparing LLM-generated and human-authored questions, and another guided by common interviewer mistake frameworks.

Result: LLM-generated questions were found to be on par with human-authored questions in clarity, relevancy, and informativeness, and outperformed them when guided by interviewer mistake frameworks.

Conclusion: The findings suggest LLMs like GPT-4 can assist interviewers by generating high-quality, contextually relevant questions, thus improving the efficiency of requirements elicitation interviews.

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the convergence of computational strategies between AI models and the human brain, finding that higher-performing models align more with brain activity and brain-like representations underpin performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether AI systems with fundamentally different architectures and learning mechanisms evolve computational strategies similar to the human brain, offering insights into intelligence and guiding AI development.

Method: The study analyzed over 600 AI models in language and vision domains, measuring alignment between brain activity and AI representations over 60 million data points, and conducted longitudinal analyses to track changes during training.

Result: Higher-performing models show stronger alignment with brain activity. Language models align more strongly with regions like the limbic system, while vision models align progressively with visual cortices. As models scale, alignment shifts toward high-order associative regions.

Conclusion: Optimization for task performance naturally drives AI towards brain-like computational strategies, providing insights into intelligent information processing and practical direction for advancing AI capabilities.

Abstract: Artificial and biological systems may evolve similar computational solutions
despite fundamental differences in architecture and learning mechanisms -- a
form of convergent evolution. We demonstrate this phenomenon through
large-scale analysis of alignment between human brain activity and internal
representations of over 600 AI models spanning language and vision domains,
from 1.33M to 72B parameters. Analyzing 60 million alignment measurements
reveals that higher-performing models spontaneously develop stronger brain
alignment without explicit neural constraints, with language models showing
markedly stronger correlation (r=0.89, p<7.5e-13) than vision models (r=0.53,
p<2.0e-44). Crucially, longitudinal analysis demonstrates that brain alignment
consistently precedes performance improvements during training, suggesting that
developing brain-like representations may be a necessary stepping stone toward
higher capabilities. We find systematic patterns: language models exhibit
strongest alignment with limbic and integrative regions, while vision models
show progressive alignment with visual cortices; deeper processing layers
converge across modalities; and as representational scale increases, alignment
systematically shifts from primary sensory to higher-order associative regions.
These findings provide compelling evidence that optimization for task
performance naturally drives AI systems toward brain-like computational
strategies, offering both fundamental insights into principles of intelligent
information processing and practical guidance for developing more capable AI
systems.

TL;DR: This paper examines whether advanced AI designs with self-referential mechanisms indicate machine consciousness. It concludes that while these architectures improve functionality, they do not equate to consciousness or ethical personhood.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ongoing debates on whether contemporary AI architectures can be considered conscious, using insights from philosophy, cognitive science, and AI engineering.

Method: The paper employs conceptual analysis, comparative architecture reviews, neuroscience integration, and case studies, complemented by normative risk assessments rooted in phenomenology and embodied cognition.

Result: Technical examples show functional self-modeling can occur without subjective experience. Symbol grounding, embodiment, and affective qualia are identified as unresolved challenges for attributing consciousness to AI.

Conclusion: Recursive, self-referential AI designs enhance capability without providing sentience or moral status, reframing the "hard problem" of consciousness as testable but unresolved.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether contemporary AI architectures employing deep
recursion, meta-learning, and self-referential mechanisms provide evidence of
machine consciousness. Integrating philosophical history, cognitive science,
and AI engineering, it situates recursive algorithms within a lineage spanning
Cartesian dualism, Husserlian intentionality, Integrated Information Theory,
the Global Workspace model, and enactivist perspectives. The argument proceeds
through textual analysis, comparative architecture review, and synthesis of
neuroscience findings on integration and prediction. Methodologically, the
study combines conceptual analysis, case studies, and normative risk assessment
informed by phenomenology and embodied cognition. Technical examples, including
transformer self-attention, meta-cognitive agents, and neuromorphic chips,
illustrate how functional self-modeling can arise without subjective
experience. By distinguishing functional from phenomenal consciousness, the
paper argues that symbol grounding, embodiment, and affective qualia remain
unresolved barriers to attributing sentience to current AI. Ethical analysis
explores risks of premature anthropomorphism versus neglect of future sentient
systems; legal implications include personhood, liability, authorship, and
labor impacts. Future directions include quantum architectures, embodied
robotics, unsupervised world modeling, and empirical tests for non-biological
phenomenality. The study reframes the "hard problem" as a graded and
increasingly testable phenomenon, rather than a metaphysical impasse. It
concludes that recursive self-referential design enhances capability but does
not entail consciousness or justify moral status. Keywords: Recursive
algorithms; self-reference; machine consciousness; AI ethics; AI consciousness

### [260] [REMI: Reconstructing Episodic Memory During Intrinsic Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02064)
*Zhaoze Wang,Genela Morris,Dori Derdikman,Pratik Chaudhari,Vijay Balasubramanian*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper examines how grid and place cells in the brain jointly support spatial planning, incorporating environmental cues with grid-based location mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to clarify why animals maintain two spatial representations—grid and place cells—despite their overlapping roles in encoding spatial information, focusing on their potential dual function in planning and memory.

Method: The authors propose a model where place cells associate sensory and motivational cues with grid cell patterns, enabling efficient goal recall and planning. They use a recurrent neural network to simulate the HC-MEC loop and its role in planning.

Result: The proposed RNN model demonstrated how grid cell states can sequentially update for path planning and how intermediate states can trigger place cell-driven memory reconstruction along planned paths.

Conclusion: This integrated HC-MEC model of grid- and place-based planning suggests novel mechanisms for long-distance navigation and makes testable predictions about spatial memory and planning processes in the brain.

Abstract: Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are believed to path
integrate speed and direction signals to activate at triangular grids of
locations in an environment, thus implementing a population code for position.
In parallel, place cells in the hippocampus (HC) fire at spatially confined
locations, with selectivity tuned not only to allocentric position but also to
environmental contexts, such as sensory cues. Although grid and place cells
both encode spatial information and support memory for multiple locations, why
animals maintain two such representations remains unclear. Noting that place
representations seem to have other functional roles in intrinsically motivated
tasks such as recalling locations from sensory cues, we propose that animals
maintain grid and place representations together to support planning.
Specifically, we posit that place cells auto-associate not only sensory
information relayed from the MEC but also grid cell patterns, enabling recall
of goal location grid patterns from sensory and motivational cues, permitting
subsequent planning with only grid representations. We extend a previous
theoretical framework for grid-cell-based planning and show that local
transition rules can generalize to long-distance path forecasting. We further
show that a planning network can sequentially update grid cell states toward
the goal. During this process, intermediate grid activity can trigger place
cell pattern completion, reconstructing experiences along the planned path. We
demonstrate all these effects using a single-layer RNN that simultaneously
models the HC-MEC loop and the planning subnetwork. We show that such recurrent
mechanisms for grid cell-based planning, with goal recall driven by the place
system, make several characteristic, testable predictions.

*Jacob J. Morra,Kaitlyn E. Fouke,Kexin Hang,Zichen He,Owen Traubert,Timothy W. Dunn,Eva A. Naumann*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of pre-trained transformers (LLMs) for decoding animal behavior from large-scale brain activity data, using larval zebrafish as a model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of decoding behavior emerging from neural activity in large, complex mammalian brains, leveraging the sequence-to-sequence capabilities and task generalization of modern pre-trained LLMs.

Method: The researchers conducted a systematic evaluation of pre-trained LLMs for decoding behavior from brain-wide calcium imaging in larval zebrafish, exposing them to visual motion stimuli. They introduced a framework called NLP4Neuro.

Result: Pre-trained LLMs outperformed non-pretrained models in neural decoding, and the DeepSeek Coder-7b model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, long-term tail movement prediction, and anatomically interpretable neuron salience.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially those pre-trained on natural language, show strong potential for decoding brain-wide neural circuits and interpreting neural activity during behavior, opening new avenues in neuroscience.

Abstract: Delineating how animal behavior arises from neural activity is a foundational
goal of neuroscience. However, as the computations underlying behavior unfold
in networks of thousands of individual neurons across the entire brain, this
presents challenges for investigating neural roles and computational mechanisms
in large, densely wired mammalian brains during behavior. Transformers, the
backbones of modern large language models (LLMs), have become powerful tools
for neural decoding from smaller neural populations. These modern LLMs have
benefited from extensive pre-training, and their sequence-to-sequence learning
has been shown to generalize to novel tasks and data modalities, which may also
confer advantages for neural decoding from larger, brain-wide activity
recordings. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of off-the-shelf LLMs to
decode behavior from brain-wide populations, termed NLP4Neuro, which we used to
test LLMs on simultaneous calcium imaging and behavior recordings in larval
zebrafish exposed to visual motion stimuli. Through NLP4Neuro, we found that
LLMs become better at neural decoding when they use pre-trained weights learned
from textual natural language data. Moreover, we found that a recent
mixture-of-experts LLM, DeepSeek Coder-7b, significantly improved behavioral
decoding accuracy, predicted tail movements over long timescales, and provided
anatomically consistent highly interpretable readouts of neuron salience.
NLP4Neuro demonstrates that LLMs are highly capable of informing brain-wide
neural circuit dissection.

*Kai Chen,Zhong-qi K. Tian,Yifei Chen,Songting Li,Douglas Zhou*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method, Pairwise Time-Delayed Transfer Entropy (PTD-TE), to infer network connectivity, improving accuracy, scalability, and robustness over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics and functions of complex networks requires analyzing structural connectivity, but in many networks, this connectivity is unobservable and must be inferred. Current methods, like Transfer Entropy (TE), face challenges such as dimensionality issues and unclear linkage between causal and structural connectivity.

Method: The proposed PTD-TE method establishes a theoretical quadratic relationship between PTD-TE values and node coupling strengths. It also addresses dimensionality challenges and is demonstrated to work across biological neuronal networks, nonlinear physical systems, and electrophysiological data.

Result: PTD-TE achieves consistent and high-performance reconstructions, with superior accuracy and robustness against noise compared to other existing methods. Tests confirm its applicability across varied network systems.

Conclusion: PTD-TE offers a model-agnostic, scalable tool that addresses key challenges in structural connectivity inference, making it highly effective for nonlinear real-world networks.

Abstract: Analyzing network structural connectivity is crucial for understanding
dynamics and functions of complex networks across disciplines. In many
networks, structural connectivity is not observable, which requires to be
inferred via causal inference methods. Among them, transfer entropy (TE) is one
of the most broadly applied causality measure due to its model-free property.
However, TE often faces the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional
probability estimation, and the relation between the inferred causal
connectivity and the underlying structural connectivity remains poorly
understood. Here we address these issues by proposing a pairwise time-delayed
transfer entropy (PTD-TE) method. We theoretically establish a quadratic
relationship between PTD-TE values and node coupling strengths, and demonstrate
its immunity to dimensionality issues and broad applicability. Tests on
biological neuronal networks, nonlinear physical systems, and
electrophysiological data show PTD-TE achieves consistent, high-performance
reconstructions. Compared to a bunch of existing approaches for network
connectivity reconstruction, PTD-TE outperforms these methods across various
network systems in accuracy and robustness against noise. Our framework
provides a scalable, model-agnostic tool for structural connectivity inference
in nonlinear real-world networks.

*Kai Chen,Mingzhang Wang,Songting Li,Douglas Zhou*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic neuronal networks. It presents a method that combines change point detection (CPD) and pairwise time-delayed correlation coefficient (TDCC) for accurately inferring structural connectivity even amid changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuronal network connectivity is fundamental to understanding brain functions, but its dynamic nature and plasticity make it difficult to measure experimentally. Existing methods fail to account for structural changes, limiting their applicability.

Method: The authors proposed a CPD-TDCC framework that identifies changes in structural connectivity using neuronal voltage time series. They then employ TDCC to reconstruct the network, demonstrating the method's effectiveness through simulations across various neuronal models.

Result: The proposed method accurately detects structural changes in network topology and synaptic strengths, even with sparse subnetwork samples. It surpasses conventional approaches by addressing dynamic connectivity changes.

Conclusion: The CPD-TDCC framework fills a critical gap, enabling accurate neuronal network reconstructions in changing conditions. This innovation has significant implications for experimental neuroscience, particularly in studying brain structure and dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics and functions critically depends on knowledge of
the network connectivity among neurons. However, the complexity of brain
structural connectivity, coupled with continuous modifications driven by
synaptic plasticity, makes its direct experimental measurement particularly
challenging. Conventional connectivity inference methods based on neuronal
recordings often assumes a static underlying structural connectivity and
requires stable statistical features of neural activities, making them
unsuitable for reconstructing structural connectivity that undergoes changes.
To fulfill the needs of reconstructing networks undergoing potential structural
changes, we propose a unified network reconstruction framework that combines
connectivity-induced change point detection (CPD) with pairwise time-delayed
correlation coefficient (TDCC) method. For general neuronal networks in
balanced regimes, we develop a theoretical analysis for discriminating changes
in structural connectivity based on the fluctuation of neuronal voltage time
series. We then demonstrate a pairwise TDCC method to reconstruct the network
using spike train recordings segmented at the detected change points. We show
the effectiveness of our CPD-TDCC network reconstruction using large-scale
network simulations with multiple neuronal models. Crucially, our method
accommodates networks with changes in both network topologies and synaptic
coupling strengths while retaining accuracy even with sparsely sampled
subnetwork data, achieving a critical advancement for practical applications in
real experimental situations. Our CPD-TDCC framework addresses the critical gap
in network reconstruction by accounting connectivity-induced changes points,
potentially offering a valuable tool for studying structure and dynamics in the
cortical brain.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper presents a mathematical theory of consciousness linking neurochemical states, supported by clinical data analysis, with dopamine and serotonin as key regulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified mathematical and mechanistic explanation for varying states of consciousness and paradoxical phenomena in neurochemical regulation.

Method: A mathematical formalism in neurochemical space combined with analysis of clinical data from sleep records of 242 Parkinson's disease patients.

Result: Confirmed predictions of state-dependent, non-linear neurochemical dynamics through statistical analysis showing significant LEDD x UPDRS interaction.

Conclusion: Consciousness operates as a dynamic, non-linear function in neurochemical space, with dopamine intensity and serotonin complexity modulation explaining diverse states.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theory of consciousness grounded in
mathematical formalism and supported by clinical data analysis. The framework
developed herein demonstrates that consciousness exists as a continuous,
non-monotonic function across a high-dimensional neurochemical space, with
dopamine serving as the primary intensity regulator and serotonin (5-HT2A) as
the complexity modulator. This work offers mechanistic explanations for the
full spectrum of conscious states, from deep sleep and psychosis to the
ultimate collapse in neural death. The theory explains paradoxical phenomena
such as prefrontal cortex hypoactivity during seizures, the evolutionary
persistence of psychosis-prone individuals, and why controlled administration
of classical 5-HT2A agonists shows a comparatively low incidence of serious
medical events (< 0.01 % in modern clinical trials), while dopaminergic excess
proves rapidly lethal. The framework is tested using 70,290 sleep nights from
242 Parkinson's disease patients, using disease severity (UPDRS) as a proxy for
system integrity and medication (LEDD) as a proxy for dopaminergic input. The
analysis reveals a significant LEDD x UPDRS interaction (beta=-1.7, p<.0001),
confirming the model's prediction of state-dependent, non-linear dynamics.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical insights into the adaptive ISTA algorithm for solving the LASSO problem, focusing on fixed points and convergence properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the lack of theoretical understanding of adaptive ISTA, which is widely applied but not well-studied in terms of its mathematical properties.

Method: The authors analyze the algorithm using a thresholding strategy based on noise level estimation via the median absolute deviation, investigating fixed points' properties and proving convergence behaviors.

Result: Key findings are scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, local stability of fixed points, and both local linear and global convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: The paper enhances the theoretical foundation of the adaptive ISTA algorithm, supporting its practical utility and providing insights into its behavior and efficiency.

Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular
algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without
explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the
adaptive ISTA is a successful practical algorithm, few theoretical results
exist. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis on the adaptive ISTA
with the thresholding strategy of estimating noise level by median absolute
deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including
scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear
convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid approach combining Christoffel sampling and optimal experimental design to tackle least-squares function approximation in high-noise settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently estimating conditional expectations, particularly in scenarios with significant noise, where existing methods perform suboptimally.

Method: A hybrid algorithm combining Christoffel sampling and optimal experimental design, extended to convex-constrained settings and adaptive random subspaces.

Result: The algorithm improves computational efficiency, reduces sample complexity, and provides strong theoretical guarantees, supported by synthetic and real-world tests in computational finance.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves both noise resilience and optimality in function approximation, demonstrating its robustness in noisy and constrained environments.

Abstract: Motivated by the need for efficient estimation of conditional expectations,
we consider a least-squares function approximation problem with heavily
polluted data. Existing methods that are powerful in the small noise regime are
suboptimal when large noise is present. We propose a hybrid approach that
combines Christoffel sampling with certain types of optimal experimental design
to address this issue. We show that the proposed algorithm enjoys appropriate
optimality properties for both sample point generation and noise mollification,
leading to improved computational efficiency and sample complexity compared to
existing methods. We also extend the algorithm to convex-constrained settings
with similar theoretical guarantees. When the target function is defined as the
expectation of a random field, we extend our approach to leverage adaptive
random subspaces and establish results on the approximation capacity of the
adaptive procedure. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies
on both synthetic data and on a more challenging stochastic simulation problem
in computational finance.

TL;DR: This paper investigates enhancing matrix completion with knowledge transfer, introducing a transfer learning procedure for optimal performance and proving its convergence and minimax optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of low-rank matrix completion by leveraging auxiliary datasets rather than relying solely on a single target dataset.

Method: The authors proposed a transfer learning framework, studied its convergence, and utilized advanced concentration inequalities to ensure minimax optimality. An additional detection procedure is designed to identify relevant source datasets.

Result: With source matrices closely aligned to the target, the proposed method achieves better convergence rates than traditional approaches and provides selection consistency for informative sources.

Conclusion: The methodology outperforms traditional matrix completion methods when relevant source datasets are leveraged, and its theoretical properties are strongly supported by simulations and real-world data analysis.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the knowledge transfer under the setting of matrix
completion, which aims to enhance the estimation of a low-rank target matrix
with auxiliary data available. We propose a transfer learning procedure given
prior information on which source datasets are favorable. We study its
convergence rates and prove its minimax optimality. Our analysis reveals that
with the source matrices close enough to the target matrix, out method
outperforms the traditional method using the single target data. In particular,
we leverage the advanced sharp concentration inequalities introduced in
\cite{brailovskaya2024universality} to eliminate a logarithmic factor in the
convergence rate, which is crucial for proving the minimax optimality. When the
relevance of source datasets is unknown, we develop an efficient detection
procedure to identify informative sources and establish its selection
consistency. Simulations and real data analysis are conducted to support the
validity of our methodology.

*Jikai Jin,Lester Mackey,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper investigates causal inference under black-box nuisance function estimates and finds that performance depends critically on treatment noise distribution. New procedures outperform traditional estimators like DML in certain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve causal effect estimation using machine learning, focusing on addressing the limitations of existing methods like double machine learning (DML) in handling treatment noise and nuisance errors.

Method: The authors analyze the partially linear model and propose new ACE procedures that adapt to treatment noise by using cumulant estimators for achieving higher-order insensitivity to nuisance errors.

Result: DML is proven minimax optimal only for Gaussian treatment noise, but new ACE procedures outperform DML under non-Gaussian noise by leveraging higher-order robustness.

Conclusion: Using synthetic experiments, the authors demonstrate that higher-order robust estimators are practical and effective, offering significant improvements where traditional models like DML fail.

Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a
treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance
functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we
find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the
treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of
\citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine
learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise,
resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for
independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal
by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to
nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant
estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever
the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results
with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear
model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate
the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.

TL;DR: This paper improves sparse variational Gaussian processes by introducing a block-diagonal structure for posterior scaling, achieving better performance with similar computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance and flexibility of sparse variational Gaussian processes by refining posterior approximation methods.

Method: A block-diagonal scaling matrix is introduced to the conditional posterior density, and its effectiveness is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally. The framework of Power Expectation Propagation (PEP) is also revisited and adapted to benefit from these structured posteriors.

Result: The block-diagonal approximation offers consistent improvements over diagonal methods without increasing computational costs. The PEP adaptation demonstrates strong performance across various hyperparameter settings.

Conclusion: The proposed block-diagonal approximation and extended PEP framework improve upon existing sparse GP methods, offering better performance and greater flexibility while retaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Inducing-point-based sparse variational Gaussian processes have become the
standard workhorse for scaling up GP models. Recent advances show that these
methods can be improved by introducing a diagonal scaling matrix to the
conditional posterior density given the inducing points. This paper first
considers an extension that employs a block-diagonal structure for the scaling
matrix, provably tightening the variational lower bound. We then revisit the
unifying framework of sparse GPs based on Power Expectation Propagation (PEP)
and show that it can leverage and benefit from the new structured approximate
posteriors. Through extensive regression experiments, we show that the proposed
block-diagonal approximation consistently performs similarly to or better than
existing diagonal approximations while maintaining comparable computational
costs. Furthermore, the new PEP framework with structured posteriors provides
competitive performance across various power hyperparameter settings, offering
practitioners flexible alternatives to standard variational approaches.

*Michael A. Kraus,Helen Bartsch*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The study combines AutoML and XAI to predict fatigue strength in welded steel structures, integrating domain knowledge with algorithmic insights. It finds ensemble models most effective and identifies key predictors such as stress ratio and stress range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance predictive accuracy and interpretability of fatigue strength models by combining data-driven and domain-informed approaches, addressing limitations in engineering assessments.

Method: Utilizing AutoML and XAI to train models (gradient boosting, random forest, neural networks) under different feature schemes, and comparing domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined feature approaches for performance and explainability.

Result: Ensemble methods like CatBoost and LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy. Domain-informed models balanced performance with interpretability, while the feature-dense model had poorer generalization. XAI identified dominant factors influencing fatigue strength.

Conclusion: The unified AutoML-XAI framework provides accurate and interpretable fatigue strength models, bridging engineering and AI. This approach shows potential for AI-assisted design and future extensions like probabilistic modeling and digital twin integration.

Abstract: This research introduces a unified approach combining Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict
fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. It integrates
expert-driven feature engineering with algorithmic feature creation to enhance
accuracy and explainability.
  Based on the extensive fatigue test database regression models - gradient
boosting, random forests, and neural networks - were trained using AutoML under
three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. This allowed
a systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.
  Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The
domain-informed model $\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE
$\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.780% over the full $\Delta
\sigma_{c,50\%}$ range, and RMSE $\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.527%
within the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model
($\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization,
while the simpler base-feature model ($\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably,
confirming the robustness of minimalist designs.
  XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress
range $\Delta \sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG
dressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors -
plate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected
fatigue life.
  This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate,
interpretable, and robust fatigue strength models for welded steel structures.
It bridges data-driven modeling with engineering validation, enabling
AI-assisted design and assessment. Future work will explore probabilistic
fatigue life modeling and integration into digital twin environments.

*Linh Nguyen,Marcel Boersma,Erman Acar*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE-FIN, a graph neural network-based approach for fraud detection in financial networks that addresses challenges like sparse labels and explainability using Granger causal explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle two key obstacles in financial fraud detection: sparsely labeled data and the need for explainability in flagged results due to business regulations.

Method: SAGE-FIN utilizes a semi-supervised graph neural network that processes weakly labeled or unlabeled data and provides Granger causal explanations for identified fraudulent items.

Result: SAGE-FIN demonstrated strong empirical performance on the Elliptic++ financial network dataset, successfully identifying frauds and explaining them using causality relationships in the network.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SAGE-FIN is an effective and interpretable solution for fraud detection, addressing both technical challenges—data sparsity and regulatory explainability requirements—without assuming a predefined network structure.

Abstract: Fraudulent activity in the financial industry costs billions annually.
Detecting fraud, therefore, is an essential yet technically challenging task
that requires carefully analyzing large volumes of data. While machine learning
(ML) approaches seem like a viable solution, applying them successfully is not
so easy due to two main challenges: (1) the sparsely labeled data, which makes
the training of such approaches challenging (with inherent labeling costs), and
(2) lack of explainability for the flagged items posed by the opacity of ML
models, that is often required by business regulations. This article proposes
SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network (GNN) based approach with
Granger causal explanations for Financial Interaction Networks. SAGE-FIN learns
to flag fraudulent items based on weakly labeled (or unlabelled) data points.
To adhere to regulatory requirements, the flagged items are explained by
highlighting related items in the network using Granger causality. We
empirically validate the favorable performance of SAGE-FIN on a real-world
dataset, Bipartite Edge-And-Node Attributed financial network (Elliptic++),
with Granger-causal explanations for the identified fraudulent items without
any prior assumption on the network structure.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'DeepSupp,' a deep learning model for detecting financial support levels using multi-head attention and unsupervised clustering to outperform existing methods in SR level detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional and machine learning-based SR identification approaches, which struggle with modern, volatile market complexities and seldom focus on structural level analysis.

Method: DeepSupp employs dynamic correlation matrices, an attention-based autoencoder for representation learning, and DBSCAN clustering to detect SR levels, leveraging multi-head attention to analyze spatial and microstructural market relationships.

Result: DeepSupp consistently outperformed six baseline methods in detecting financial support levels across six financial metrics on S&P 500 tickers, demonstrating robustness across varying market conditions.

Conclusion: DeepSupp fills critical gaps in SR level detection by employing advanced attention-based architectures, enhancing the reliability and scalability of financial technical analysis.

Abstract: Support and resistance (SR) levels are central to technical analysis, guiding
traders in entry, exit, and risk management. Despite widespread use,
traditional SR identification methods often fail to adapt to the complexities
of modern, volatile markets. Recent research has introduced machine learning
techniques to address the following challenges, yet most focus on price
prediction rather than structural level identification. This paper presents
DeepSupp, a new deep learning approach for detecting financial support levels
using multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial correlations and
market microstructure relationships. DeepSupp integrates advanced feature
engineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving
market relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust
representation learning. The final support levels are extracted through
unsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price
thresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&P 500 tickers demonstrate that
DeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy
and market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market
conditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a
scalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach
highlights the potential of attention-based architectures to uncover nuanced
market patterns and improve technical trading strategies.

model outputs both 7-day employment forecasts and an interpretable Industry
Employment Health Index (IEHI). Our approach outperforms baseline models across
most sectors, particularly in stable industries, and demonstrates strong
alignment between IEHI rankings and actual employment volatility. We discuss
error patterns, sector-specific performance, and future directions for
improving interpretability and generalization.

*Yingjie Niu,Mingchuan Zhao,Valerio Poti,Ruihai Dong*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper proposes a tailored Node-level Graph Attention Network (NGAT) for financial stock prediction and showcases its superior performance while addressing key challenges faced by existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in current graph-based methods for financial stock prediction, such as overlooking relational information, poor generalization, and limited graph structure comparisons.

Method: The authors propose a new long-term stock prediction task and design NGAT, a customized network for corporate relationship graphs, while also analyzing the inadequacies of model-dependent graph comparisons.

Result: Experimental evaluations across two datasets demonstrate NGAT's effectiveness in addressing relational and structural complexities in financial graphs.

Conclusion: NGAT improves company representation for financial applications, providing better prediction accuracy and addressing shortcomings in existing graph-based approaches. Code is shared for reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Graph representation learning methods have been widely adopted in financial
applications to enhance company representations by leveraging inter-firm
relationships. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) The
advantages of relational information are obscured by limitations in downstream
task designs; (2) Existing graph models specifically designed for stock
prediction often suffer from excessive complexity and poor generalization; (3)
Experience-based construction of corporate relationship graphs lacks effective
comparison of different graph structures. To address these limitations, we
propose a long-term stock prediction task and develop a Node-level Graph
Attention Network (NGAT) specifically tailored for corporate relationship
graphs. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the limitations of existing
graph comparison methods based on model downstream task performance.
Experimental results across two datasets consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed task and model. The project is publicly available
on GitHub to encourage reproducibility and future research.

TL;DR: This study shows that the LSTM model achieves over 90% accuracy in predicting stock returns on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stock market prediction is challenging for investors, and improving predictability can significantly enhance confidence and decision-making.

Method: Data from the NSE was cleaned and normalized before implementing an LSTM model. Performance was assessed and compared against deep learning models like ANN and CNN.

Result: The LSTM model achieved over 90% prediction accuracy on a reliable dataset.

Conclusion: LSTM models are effective for predicting financial time-series, and future work should explore hybrid techniques with other deep learning methods to enhance accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Investors and stock market analysts face major challenges in predicting stock
returns and making wise investment decisions. The predictability of equity
stock returns can boost investor confidence, but it remains a difficult task.
To address this issue, a study was conducted using a Long Short-term Memory
(LSTM) model to predict future stock market movements. The study used a
historical dataset from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), which was cleaned
and normalized to design the LSTM model. The model was evaluated using
performance metrics and compared with other deep learning models like
Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The experimental results
showed that the LSTM model can predict future stock market prices and returns
with over 90% accuracy when trained with a reliable dataset. The study
concludes that LSTM models can be useful in predicting financial
time-series-related problems if well-trained. Future studies should explore
combining LSTM models with other deep learning techniques like CNN to create
hybrid models that mitigate the risks associated with relying on a single model
for future equity stock predictions.

### [276] [News Sentiment Embeddings for Stock Price Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01970)
*Ayaan Qayyum*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper studies how Wall Street Journal headlines can predict SPY stock prices using text embeddings and PCA, achieving a 40% improvement in predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve stock price prediction by leveraging nuanced impacts of news headlines alongside financial and economic data.

Method: OpenAI-based text embedding models with PCA are used to process news headlines, paired with other financial indicators, and trained on 390 machine-learning models.

Result: Incorporating headline embeddings led to a 40% improvement in stock price forecasting over models that didn't use headline data.

Conclusion: Using text embeddings for news headlines significantly enhances the ability to predict stock price movements, demonstrating the value of combining qualitative and quantitative data.

Abstract: This paper will discuss how headline data can be used to predict stock
prices. The stock price in question is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, also known
as SPY that tracks the performance of the largest 500 publicly traded
corporations in the United States. A key focus is to use news headlines from
the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to predict the movement of stock prices on a
daily timescale with OpenAI-based text embedding models used to create vector
encodings of each headline with principal component analysis (PCA) to exact the
key features. The challenge of this work is to capture the time-dependent and
time-independent, nuanced impacts of news on stock prices while handling
potential lag effects and market noise. Financial and economic data were
collected to improve model performance; such sources include the U.S. Dollar
Index (DXY) and Treasury Interest Yields. Over 390 machine-learning inference
models were trained. The preliminary results show that headline data embeddings
greatly benefit stock price prediction by at least 40% compared to training and
optimizing a machine learning system without headline data embeddings.

### [277] [Subtyping in DHOL -- Extended preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02855)
*Colin Rothgang,Florian Rabe*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper extends dependent typed higher-order logic (DHOL) with refinement and quotient types, maintaining automation and soundness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Refinement and quotient types are desired in automated theorem proving, but their undecidable nature makes them hard to incorporate in type systems based on standard higher-order logic (HOL).

Method: The authors use DHOL's existing framework, adding refinement and quotient types as subtyping cases, with their syntax, semantics, and translation to HOL detailed alongside proofs.

Result: The paper demonstrates that DHOL can incorporate refinement and quotient types elegantly while retaining its translation-based automated theorem proving ability.

Conclusion: This work enhances DHOL's expressiveness by adding refinement and quotient types without sacrificing automation or soundness, solving a long-standing challenge in the domain.

Abstract: The recently introduced dependent typed higher-order logic (DHOL) offers an
interesting compromise between expressiveness and automation support. It
sacrifices the decidability of its type system in order to significantly extend
its expressiveness over standard HOL. Yet it retains strong automated theorem
proving support via a sound and complete translation to HOL.
  We leverage this design to extend DHOL with refinement and quotient types.
Both of these are commonly requested by practitioners but rarely provided by
automated theorem provers. This is because they inherently require undecidable
typing and thus are very difficult to retrofit to decidable type systems. But
with DHOL already doing the heavy lifting, adding them is not only possible but
elegant and simple.
  Concretely, we add refinement and quotient types as special cases of
subtyping. This turns the associated canonical inclusion resp. projection maps
into identity maps and thus avoids costly changes in representation. We present
the syntax, semantics, and translation to HOL for the extended language,
including the proofs of soundness and completeness.

*Wangbin Ding,Lei Li,Junyi Qiu,Bogen Lin,Mingjing Yang,Liqin Huang,Lianming Wu,Sihan Wang,Xiahai Zhuang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CineMyoPS, a neural network for segmenting myocardial pathologies (scars and edema) using cine CMR images, which avoids contrast agents and achieves high segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a global health issue, and current imaging methods like LGE and T2-weighted CMR for pathology segmentation are time-intensive and require contrast agents. There is a need for faster, less invasive techniques.

Method: The paper proposes CineMyoPS, an end-to-end deep neural network. It extracts motion and anatomy features from cine CMR images, employs a consistency loss for joint learning of interdependent features, and integrates MI-related features across the cardiac cycle with a time-series aggregation strategy.

Result: Experimental results on a multi-center dataset show CineMyoPS performs well in segmenting myocardial pathologies, estimating motion, and segmenting anatomy.

Conclusion: CineMyoPS offers a non-contrast, efficient method to perform myocardial pathology segmentation, potentially improving MI risk assessment and management.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are
essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although
combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful,
acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to
the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free
imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities
of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end
deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial
pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically,
CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given
the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss
(resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning.
Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate
MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation
accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center
dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial
pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.

### [279] [A robust and versatile deep learning model for prediction of the arterial input function in dynamic small animal $\left[^{18}\text{F}\right]$FDG PET imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02367)
*Christian Salomonsen,Luigi Tommaso Luppino,Fredrik Aspheim,Kristoffer Wickstrøm,Elisabeth Wetzer,Michael Kampffmeyer,Rodrigo Berzaghi,Rune Sundset,Robert Jenssen,Samuel Kuttner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a non-invasive deep learning method (FC-DLIF) to predict arterial input functions (AIF) from PET imaging in small animals, avoiding the need for invasive blood sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional arterial blood sampling to estimate the arterial input function (AIF) in small animals is invasive, technically challenging, time-consuming, and does not allow for longitudinal studies.

Method: The proposed FC-DLIF model uses deep learning with a spatial feature extractor for volumetric PET images and a temporal feature extractor to predict the AIF. It is trained and evaluated using [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data and tested on modified scan conditions.

Result: The model accurately predicted AIF with good mean squared error and correlation. It worked well on truncated and shifted scans but failed for radiotracers not included in the training data.

Conclusion: The FC-DLIF model offers a reliable, non-invasive alternative to arterial blood sampling for dynamic small-animal PET, demonstrating robustness to scan time variations but limitations with untrained radiotracers.

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal
in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate
kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally
achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small
animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,
precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully
convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions
directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling
in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial
feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,
extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a
temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The
proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood
curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model
applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected
using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The
model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate
shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts
the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.
Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function
even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF
from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not
represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers
a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving
robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.

### [280] [3D Heart Reconstruction from Sparse Pose-agnostic 2D Echocardiographic Slices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02411)
*Zhurong Chen,Jinhua Chen,Wei Zhuo,Wufeng Xue,Dong Ni*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework to reconstruct personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echocardiography slices commonly used in clinical practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate estimation of clinical parameters like left ventricle volume from 2D echocardiography slices is challenging due to its 2D nature and limited views.

Method: A 3D reconstruction pipeline is designed that alternates between 3D pose estimation of 2D slices and 3D integration using an implicit neural network to transform a prior 3D heart shape into a personalized model.

Result: Using six planes, the reconstructed model improved left ventricle volume estimation error from 20.24% to 1.98%, and estimated right ventricle volume from 2D slices with a 5.75% error.

Conclusion: The proposed approach facilitates enhanced 3D structure and function analysis from cardiac ultrasounds, showing significant potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: Echocardiography (echo) plays an indispensable role in the clinical practice
of heart diseases. However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only
two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making
it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical
parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging
provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low
spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation.
  To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for
reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are
frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction
pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose
estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an
implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into
a personalized 3D heart model.
  We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the
reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume
estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In
addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important
breakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of
5.75\% ). This study provides a new way for personalized 3D structure and
function analysis from cardiac ultrasound and is of great potential in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in colorectal polyp segmentation caused by weak edges using a novel model named MEGANet-W, incorporating Haar wavelets for enhanced edge-guided attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of colorectal polyp segmentation, which is crucial for early cancer detection, by addressing issues like weak and low-contrast boundaries that hinder existing deep learning models.

Method: The method introduces MEGANet-W, which employs a two-level Haar wavelet head for edge extraction and Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (WEGA) modules to integrate wavelet-based edge information into semantic decoding.

Result: MEGANet-W achieves state-of-the-art performance across five public datasets, increasing mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, without adding extra learnable parameters.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating wavelet-driven features and edge-guided attention significantly improves colorectal polyp segmentation, offering a robust solution without increasing model complexity.

Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal
cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated
accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on
handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We
propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects
directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to
recalibrate semantic features. Our two main contributions are: (1) a two-level
Haar wavelet head for multi orientation edge extraction; and (2) Wavelet Edge
Guided Attention (WEGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with reverse and input
branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANetW consistently outperforms
existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while
introducing no additional learnable parameters.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhanced strategies for Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) to improve image classification accuracy, combining selective feature re-encoding and a parallel-mode architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of improving feature processing and classification accuracy in QCNNs for image data by leveraging quantum principles and complementary classical methods.

Method: Introduced a selective feature re-encoding method to focus on important features and a parallel-mode QCNN architecture integrating PCA and Autoencoders' outputs in a joint training scheme.

Result: Experimental results using MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets highlight improved feature processing, superior classification performance, and outperformance of the proposed methods compared to traditional or independent approaches.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that selective feature prioritization and parallel integration of classical methods enhance QCNNs, achieving better accuracy, generalization, and effective feature representation.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has seen significant advancements, driven by
recent improvements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
Leveraging quantum principles such as entanglement and superposition, quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated promising results in
classifying both quantum and classical data. This study examines QCNNs in the
context of image classification and proposes a novel strategy to enhance
feature processing and a QCNN architecture for improved classification
accuracy. First, a selective feature re-encoding strategy is proposed, which
directs the quantum circuits to prioritize the most informative features,
thereby effectively navigating the crucial regions of the Hilbert space to find
the optimal solution space. Secondly, a novel parallel-mode QCNN architecture
is designed to simultaneously incorporate features extracted by two classical
methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, within a unified
training scheme. The joint optimization involved in the training process allows
the QCNN to benefit from complementary feature representations, enabling better
mutual readjustment of model parameters. To assess these methodologies,
comprehensive experiments have been performed using the widely used MNIST and
Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification tasks. Experimental findings
reveal that the selective feature re-encoding method significantly improves the
quantum circuit's feature processing capability and performance. Furthermore,
the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture consistently outperforms the
individual QCNN models and the traditional ensemble approach involving
independent learning followed by decision fusion, confirming its superior
accuracy and generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a novel method to study the Higgs trilinear self-coupling using off-shell Higgs production, leveraging a hybrid neural simulation-based inference approach for efficient and sensitive analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address a key challenge in particle physics: experimentally determining the Higgs trilinear self-coupling, which has substantial implications for understanding the Standard Model and beyond.

Method: The proposed method combines matrix-element-enhanced techniques with classification-based methods in a hybrid neural simulation-based inference (NSBI) framework to construct a robust and efficient likelihood for examining Higgs signals and related SMEFT implications.

Result: The NSBI approach achieves near-theoretical optimum sensitivity for studying Higgs self-coupling and provides constraints for the SMEFT framework, particularly relevant for future upgrades of the Large Hadron Collider.

Conclusion: The approach offers a powerful tool for analyzing Higgs couplings and SMEFT operators, demonstrating its potential to enhance our understanding of fundamental particle physics through high-luminosity collider experiments.

Abstract: One of the forthcoming major challenges in particle physics is the
experimental determination of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling. While efforts
have largely focused on on-shell double- and single-Higgs production in
proton-proton collisions, off-shell Higgs production has also been proposed as
a valuable complementary probe. In this article, we design a hybrid neural
simulation-based inference (NSBI) approach to construct a likelihood of the
Higgs signal incorporating modifications from the Standard Model effective
field theory (SMEFT), relevant background processes, and quantum interference
effects. It leverages the training efficiency of matrix-element-enhanced
techniques, which are vital for robust SMEFT applications, while also
incorporating the practical advantages of classification-based methods for
effective background estimates. We demonstrate that our NSBI approach achieves
sensitivity close to the theoretical optimum and provide expected constraints
for the high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider. While we
primarily concentrate on the Higgs trilinear self-coupling, we also consider
constraints on other SMEFT operators that affect off-shell Higgs production.

Motivation: Traditional stress testing methods struggle with limitations in dimensionality and accurately modeling market conditions. The study aims to leverage machine learning to overcome these challenges.

Method: The paper begins with Principal Component Analysis and Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction and modeling, then employs Variational Autoencoders to incorporate a probabilistic latent space for advanced Monte Carlo scenario generation.

Result: The methodology allows for nuanced market stress simulations, capturing non-linear dependencies, and provides tools for risk assessment such as Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall.

Conclusion: Machine learning techniques improve the flexibility, robustness, and realism of financial stress testing, making them a strong alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning driven framework for sectoral stress
testing in the Indian financial market, focusing on financial services,
information technology, energy, consumer goods, and pharmaceuticals. Initially,
we address the limitations observed in conventional stress testing through
dimensionality reduction and latent factor modeling via Principal Component
Analysis and Autoencoders. Building on this, we extend the methodology using
Variational Autoencoders, which introduces a probabilistic structure to the
latent space. This enables Monte Carlo-based scenario generation, allowing for
more nuanced, distribution-aware simulation of stressed market conditions. The
proposed framework captures complex non-linear dependencies and supports risk
estimation through Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. Together, these
pipelines demonstrate the potential of Machine Learning approaches to improve
the flexibility, robustness, and realism of financial stress testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven design in metamaterials is hindered by retraining needs, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and separate model requirements for forward and inverse design.

Method: A Bayesian transformer-based foundation model, MetaFO, inspired by large language models, is developed to treat metamaterials as an operator and enable probabilistic predictions.

Result: MetaFO achieves zero-shot accuracy, uncovers complex structure-property relationships, and performs nonlinear inverse design even under OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: MetaFO offers a scalable, generalizable framework, reshaping AI-driven metamaterial discovery and expanding its design capabilities for future innovations.

Abstract: Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields,
where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading
the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design
strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor
out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for
forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation
model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics
of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse,
unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also
excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating
metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural
responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and
significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable
framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving
the way for next-generation innovations.

Conclusion: NQS, equipped with transformer architectures and advanced optimization, presents as a powerful computational framework for addressing strongly correlated many-fermion systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a
promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by
leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing
highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art
results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum
model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention
heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales,
making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in
strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled
stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how well automatic speaker verification (ASV) embeddings capture voice identity and proposes a new metric, U3D, to focus on dynamic rhythm patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing voice identity in generative speech systems is difficult as existing ASV embeddings emphasize static features, neglecting dynamic components. The goal is to enhance identity characterization methods.

Method: The researchers analyzed ASV embeddings, identified their focus on static features over dynamic ones, and proposed U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm patterns.

Result: The study found ASV embeddings prioritize static elements like timbre and pitch while neglecting rhythmic dynamics. Mitigation strategies for confounding factors and a new metric (U3D) were introduced.

Conclusion: This research advances the assessment of speaker identity consistency in voice cloning systems by highlighting ASV limitations and proposing a rhythm-focused evaluation metric (U3D).

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

### [289] [ASDA: Audio Spectrogram Differential Attention Mechanism for Self-Supervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02666)
*Junyu Wang,Tianrui Wang,Meng Ge,Longbiao Wang,Jianwu Dang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper addresses ineffective attention allocation in audio self-supervised learning by introducing a differential attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of standard Transformer attention mechanisms, which often inefficiently allocate attention and hinder the model’s discriminative ability.

Method: Proposes a differential attention mechanism integrating dual-softmax operations with carefully selected differential coefficients.

Result: The proposed ASDA model achieves state-of-the-art performance on audio classification, keyword spotting, and environmental sound classification tasks.

Conclusion: The differential attention mechanism effectively enhances audio task performance, demonstrating broader applicability and improvement in self-supervised audio learning.

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio
tasks, paving the way for broader applications.

*Jérémy Rouch,M Ducrettet,S Haupert,R Emonet,F Sèbe*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This study introduces a method to evaluate and optimize call detection systems used in animal population monitoring by relating signal-to-noise ratios to detection probability, enabling better training and spatial analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance understanding and evaluation of the performance of automatic call detection systems in ecoacoustic animal monitoring, addressing the lack of acoustic-driven metrics.

Method: The authors propose a straightforward analysis approach that links the signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic acoustic signals to their detection probability, facilitating system training and spatial density assessments.

Result: The method provides insights into call detection system performance, including detection distance modeling and the ability to assess spatial density under various sound environments.

Conclusion: The proposed measure offers a valuable tool for improving and modeling acoustic detection systems, supporting more effective ecoacoustic monitoring campaigns.

Abstract: The accessibility of long-duration recorders, adapted to sometimes demanding
field conditions, has enabled the deployment of extensive animal population
monitoring campaigns through ecoacoustics. The effectiveness of automatic
signal detection methods, increasingly based on neural approaches, is
frequently evaluated solely through machine learning metrics, while acoustic
analysis of performance remains rare. As part of the acoustic monitoring of
Rock Ptarmigan populations, we propose here a simple method for acoustic
analysis of the detection system's performance. The proposed measure is based
on relating the signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their probability
of detection. We show how this measure provides information about the system
and allows optimisation of its training. We also show how it enables modelling
of the detection distance, thus offering the possibility of evaluating its
dynamics according to the sound environment and accessing an estimation of the
spatial density of calls.

*Wei Fan,Kejiang Chen,Chang Liu,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This study evaluates the effectiveness of protective perturbations against voice cloning (VC) under realistic threat models and proposes a novel two-stage purification method to counter adversarial VC defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by privacy and security concerns related to advanced voice cloning (VC) technologies and the limitations of existing adversarial perturbation-based protections.

Method: The authors evaluate protective perturbations against realistic VC threat models that include purification attempts, and propose a two-stage purification approach: (1) purify perturbed speech, and (2) refine it using phoneme guidance.

Result: The proposed two-stage purification method significantly outperformed existing purification methods in disrupting VC defenses, indicating current defenses' limitations.

Conclusion: Adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses have inherent vulnerabilities, and robust solutions to mitigate VC-related privacy and security risks are urgently needed.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation models has heightened privacy and
security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have
investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

*Mostafa Sadeghi,Jean-Eudes Ayilo,Romain Serizel,Xavier Alameda-Pineda*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes unsupervised speech enhancement methods using diffusion models to improve clean speech generation, achieving better results than existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve unsupervised speech enhancement, using diffusion models as generative priors, overcoming limitations like the need for trade-off hyperparameter tuning and robustness issues in existing approaches.

Method: Two alternative algorithms are proposed: one integrates the diffusion prior with the observation model without hyperparameters, and another defines a diffusion process over noisy speech for exact likelihood scoring.

Result: The methods proved effective, demonstrating improved enhancement metrics and robustness in domain shifts on datasets WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND.

Conclusion: The proposed methods outperform both supervised and unsupervised baselines in speech enhancement, showcasing the utility of principled diffusion modeling strategies.

Abstract: We explore unsupervised speech enhancement using diffusion models as
expressive generative priors for clean speech. Existing approaches guide the
reverse diffusion process using noisy speech through an approximate,
noise-perturbed likelihood score, combined with the unconditional score via a
trade-off hyperparameter. In this work, we propose two alternative algorithms
that directly model the conditional reverse transition distribution of
diffusion states. The first method integrates the diffusion prior with the
observation model in a principled way, removing the need for hyperparameter
tuning. The second defines a diffusion process over the noisy speech itself,
yielding a fully tractable and exact likelihood score. Experiments on the
WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets demonstrate improved enhancement metrics
and greater robustness to domain shifts compared to both supervised and
unsupervised baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG) framework, which uses diffusion models and node embeddings to address limitations in graph generation and demonstrates robust, scalable graph generation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing graph generation models that rely on node IDs and predefined graph structural properties, hindering their applicability to flexible and scalable graph generation.

Method: The study introduces the LGSG framework, leveraging diffusion models and node embeddings to generate graphs of varying sizes while eliminating node ID dependency and capturing subgraph structures.

Result: LGSG shows competitive performance on standard metrics, excels in specific overlooked metrics like clustering tendency, and maintains consistent structural characteristics across different graph sizes.

Conclusion: LGSG advances scalable, flexible graph generation by eliminating node ID reliance and achieving robust performance across key metrics, presenting a significant step forward in graph generation research.

Abstract: Graph generation is an important area in network science. Traditional
approaches focus on replicating specific properties of real-world graphs, such
as small diameters or power-law degree distributions. Recent advancements in
deep learning, particularly with Graph Neural Networks, have enabled
data-driven methods to learn and generate graphs without relying on predefined
structural properties. Despite these advances, current models are limited by
their reliance on node IDs, which restricts their ability to generate graphs
larger than the input graph and ignores node attributes. To address these
challenges, we propose Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG), a novel
framework that leverages diffusion models and node embeddings to generate
graphs of varying sizes without retraining. The framework eliminates the
dependency on node IDs and captures the distribution of node embeddings and
subgraph structures, enabling scalable and flexible graph generation.
Experimental results show that LGSG performs on par with baseline models for
standard metrics while outperforming them in overlooked ones, such as the
tendency of nodes to form clusters. Additionally, it maintains consistent
structural characteristics across graphs of different sizes, demonstrating
robustness and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and predict customer data-sharing behaviors in Open Banking for improved strategic insights and competitiveness.

Method: The framework employed hybrid data balancing techniques (ADASYN and NEARMISS) and XGBoost modeling, along with Explanatory Model Analysis using SHAP and CART methods.

Result: Achieved an accuracy of 91.39% for inflow and 91.53% for outflow predictions, identifying key influencers like mobile transactions and credit card usage.

Conclusion: Mobile engagement and credit-related features are pivotal for data-sharing decisions, offering actionable insights for financial institutions to innovate in Open Banking.

Abstract: The emergence of Open Banking represents a significant shift in financial
data management, influencing financial institutions' market dynamics and
marketing strategies. This increased competition creates opportunities and
challenges, as institutions manage data inflow to improve products and services
while mitigating data outflow that could aid competitors. This study introduces
a framework to predict customers' propensity to share data via Open Banking and
interprets this behavior through Explanatory Model Analysis (EMA). Using data
from a large Brazilian financial institution with approximately 3.2 million
customers, a hybrid data balancing strategy incorporating ADASYN and NEARMISS
techniques was employed to address the infrequency of data sharing and enhance
the training of XGBoost models. These models accurately predicted customer data
sharing, achieving 91.39% accuracy for inflow and 91.53% for outflow. The EMA
phase combined the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method with the
Classification and Regression Tree (CART) technique, revealing the most
influential features on customer decisions. Key features included the number of
transactions and purchases in mobile channels, interactions within these
channels, and credit-related features, particularly credit card usage across
the national banking system. These results highlight the critical role of
mobile engagement and credit in driving customer data-sharing behaviors,
providing financial institutions with strategic insights to enhance
competitiveness and innovation in the Open Banking environment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LiTEN, an advanced equivariant neural network using Tensorized Quadrangle Attention (TQA) to model biomolecular interactions efficiently and accurately. LiTEN-FF achieves state-of-the-art performance in biomolecular simulations, enabling faster and versatile applications in drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biomolecular simulation methods face challenges in balancing accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, limiting their effectiveness in understanding disease mechanisms, drug discovery, and biomaterial design.

Method: The paper presents LiTEN, leveraging Tensorized Quadrangle Attention (TQA) to model complex three- and four-body interactions efficiently. It pre-trains LiTEN-FF with a robust nablaDFT dataset and fine-tunes it using SPICE data.

Result: LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin benchmarks, outcompeting leading models like MACE and NequIP, and offers a 10x faster inference capability for large biomolecules.

Conclusion: LiTEN establishes a physically grounded and efficient framework, advancing biomolecular modeling capabilities for drug discovery and other applications through accurate and versatile simulation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism
understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation
methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient
but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details
critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM)
methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or
long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level
accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity,
accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and
insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle
Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with
linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector
operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is
a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset
for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated
system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across
most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading
models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most
comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date,
including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy
surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for
large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded,
highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling,
providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.

TL;DR: SynTwins is a framework that bridges the gap between computational molecular design and experimental synthesis by generating synthetically feasible molecule analogs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical bottleneck of generating AI-designed molecules that are difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional methods.

Method: SynTwins employs a three-step process: retrosynthesis, searching for similar building blocks, and virtual synthesis to emulate expert chemist strategies for designing accessible molecules.

Result: SynTwins outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning models in creating synthetically feasible molecular analogs, while preserving structural similarity and desired properties of the target molecules.

Conclusion: SynTwins offers a practical solution to accelerate the discovery of synthesizable molecules, bridging computational design with real-world chemical synthesis.

Abstract: The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and
their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational drug
and material discovery. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of
candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible
to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce
SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecular analog design framework that
designs synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemist
strategies through a three-step process: retrosynthesis, similar building block
searching, and virtual synthesis. In comparative evaluations, SynTwins
demonstrates superior performance in generating synthetically accessible
analogs compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining
high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when
integrated with existing molecule optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach
produces synthetically feasible molecules with property profiles comparable to
unconstrained molecule generators, yet its synthesizability ensured. Our
comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that
SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and
experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the
discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range
of applications.

TL;DR: The paper uses NLP to identify genuine green patents among a dataset of 12.4 million classified patents and examines their impact on firm performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine the identification of green patents for better classifications and understand their effects on firm-level financial outcomes.

Method: A neural network is trained on vector representations of environmental technology-related expressions to identify true green patents and link them to firm financial metrics.

Result: Only 20% of classified green patents are genuinely green; true green patents lead to increased sales, market shares, and productivity, especially high-novelty ones boosting profits.

Conclusion: Text analysis using NLP enables precise green patent identification, proving useful for policymaking and highlighting economic benefits of authentic green patents.

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the traditional CAP theorem limitations by exploring avenues to simultaneously optimize consistency and availability in distributed systems.

Method: The paper employs partition-aware state machines and integrates an economic incentive layer and game-theoretic mechanisms to stabilize and control system behavior.

Result: It demonstrates provable bounds on metrics like convergence, liveness, and correctness, and shows that consistency and availability can coexist within bounded epsilon margins.

Conclusion: The study extends the classical CAP theorem by enabling simultaneous optimization of availability and consistency through formal economic and theoretical modeling.

Abstract: The CAP theorem asserts a trilemma between consistency, availability, and
partition tolerance. This paper introduces a rigorous automata-theoretic and
economically grounded framework that reframes the CAP trade-off as a constraint
optimization problem. We model distributed systems as partition-aware state
machines and embed economic incentive layers to stabilize consensus behavior
across adversarially partitioned networks. By incorporating game-theoretic
mechanisms into the global transition semantics, we define provable bounds on
convergence, liveness, and correctness. Our results demonstrate that
availability and consistency can be simultaneously preserved within bounded
epsilon margins, effectively extending the classical CAP limits through formal
economic control.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper investigates learning Bayes correlated equilibria (BCE) in auctions like first-price and all-pay, utilizing a polynomial sample size from bidders' valuation distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in non-truthful auctions caused by independent strategic bidder behavior and equilibrium complexity by exploring the coordination of bidders via mediated BCE.

Method: The authors propose a method leveraging reduction to utility estimation problems and analyze the pseudo-dimension of monotone bidding strategies to determine sample complexity.

Result: They prove that BCEs in various non-truthful auctions can be effectively learned with a polynomial number of samples: $
\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$.

Conclusion: BCEs can serve as an effective means of improving outcomes in non-truthful auction systems, with feasible sample requirements for practical implementation.

Abstract: In non-truthful auctions such as first-price and all-pay auctions, the
independent strategic behaviors of bidders, with the corresponding equilibrium
notion -- Bayes Nash equilibria -- are notoriously difficult to characterize
and can cause undesirable outcomes. An alternative approach to designing better
auction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make
incentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the
bidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The
implementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of
bidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable. We initiate the study
of the sample complexity of learning Bayes correlated equilibria in
non-truthful auctions. We prove that the BCEs in a large class of non-truthful
auctions, including first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned with a
polynomial number $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$ of samples from the
bidders' value distributions. Our technique is a reduction to the problem of
estimating bidders' expected utility from samples, combined with an analysis of
the pseudo-dimension of the class of all monotone bidding strategies of
bidders.

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: Efficient deployment of LLMs on mobile devices faces challenges due to high computation, memory, and energy demands. This paper introduces a unified governor, FUSE, which optimizes energy efficiency and reduces latency during LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The poor interplay among energy governors of CPU, GPU, and memory in modern mobile devices leads to inefficiencies when deploying LLMs, motivating the need for a unified and optimized approach.

Method: The authors performed a measurement study to uncover inefficiencies in the default device governors and designed FUSE, a unified energy-aware governor, combining optimized specifications for CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies.

Result: FUSE improved time-to-first-token latency by 7.0%-16.9% and per-output-token latency by 25.4%-36.8%, with no increase in energy consumption compared to current governors.

Conclusion: FUSE successfully optimizes the energy efficiency of LLM inference on mobile devices, paving the way for smooth integration of LLMs in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various
applications and services running on billions of mobile devices. However,
deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge
due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While
current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,
and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors
for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate
independently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above
observation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM
framework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the
triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding
latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies
with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.
Second, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate
interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency
in LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified
energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on
mobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the
time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and
25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM
models.

learn the uncertain dynamics based on noisy measurements, including those
collected during system operation. As a key contribution, we derive robust
predictions for GP models using contraction metrics, which are incorporated in
the MPC formulation. The proposed design guarantees recursive feasibility,
robust constraint satisfaction and convergence to a reference state, with high
probability. We provide a numerical example of a planar quadrotor subject to
difficult-to-model ground effects, which highlights significant improvements
achieved through the proposed robust prediction method and through online
learning.

### [304] [Accelerated Portfolio Optimization and Option Pricing with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01972)
*Hadi Keramati,Samaneh Jazayeri*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework to optimize block-preconditioner sizes for improved efficiency in solving large linear systems in portfolio optimization and option pricing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional preconditioning techniques for solving ill-conditioned linear systems suffer from slow convergence and require extensive parameter tuning. The authors aim to address this problem by leveraging reinforcement learning.

Method: The proposed framework uses reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust block-preconditioner sizes to accelerate convergence in iterative solvers.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the RL framework significantly improves convergence speed and reduces computational costs in real-world portfolio optimization applications.

Conclusion: Using RL for preconditioning allows for more efficient and faster solutions to high-dimensional linear systems, benefiting dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing tasks.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for optimizing
block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers used in portfolio optimization
and option pricing. The covariance matrix in portfolio optimization or the
discretization of differential operators in option pricing models lead to large
linear systems of the form $\mathbf{A}\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$. Direct inversion
of high-dimensional portfolio or fine-grid option pricing incurs a significant
computational cost. Therefore, iterative methods are usually used for
portfolios in real-world situations. Ill-conditioned systems, however, suffer
from slow convergence. Traditional preconditioning techniques often require
problem-specific parameter tuning. To overcome this limitation, we rely on RL
to dynamically adjust the block-preconditioner sizes and accelerate iterative
solver convergence. Evaluations on a suite of real-world portfolio optimization
matrices demonstrate that our RL framework can be used to adjust
preconditioning and significantly accelerate convergence and reduce
computational cost. The proposed accelerated solver supports faster
decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: DeSTA2.5-Audio introduces a new Large Audio Language Model (LALM) with robust auditory perception and instruction-following capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in Large Language Models (LLMs) when augmented with auditory capabilities, and to preserve native language proficiency while achieving effective audio-text alignment.

Method: The authors propose a self-generated cross-modal alignment strategy (DeSTA), where the backbone LLM generates its own training targets, avoiding reliance on curated or synthesized audio-instruction datasets.

Result: DeSTA2.5-Audio demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance across various benchmarks through zero-shot generalization and self-generated data construction, outperforming other strategies in auditory perception and instruction-following.

Conclusion: Carefully designed data construction strategies are critical in developing robust and general-purpose Large Audio Language Models (LALMs). DeSTA highlights how self-generation improves performance effectively.

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

### [306] [Multi-agent Auditory Scene Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02755)
*Caleb Rascon,Luis Gato-Diaz,Eduardo García-Alarcón*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel multi-agent system for auditory scene analysis (ASA) to perform sound source localization, separation, and classification in parallel with feedback loops for error compensation, reducing response time and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASA systems, with their traditional linear task flow, face challenges of increased response time and sensitivity to errors, making them unsuitable for applications requiring low computational complexity and rapid processing.

Method: The proposed method adopts a multi-agent approach where tasks such as localization, separation, and classification run in parallel, with feedback loops enabling error correction across tasks. The framework is implemented using open-source tools JACK and ROS2.

Result: The proposed MASA system achieves robustness against local errors without significantly increasing complexity while ensuring low response times.

Conclusion: The MASA framework provides an efficient, error-tolerant, and open-source solution for acoustic environment analysis, enabling adaptability for various applications with minimal computational requirements.

Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic
environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,
separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a
linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their
location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of
which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario
(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).
However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,
while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to
errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and
computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop
techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives
rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a
small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,
hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this
effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where
the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate
for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to
correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the
localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent
auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,
without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.
The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses
open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent
communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

*Jakob Kienegger,Alina Mannanova,Huajian Fang,Timo Gerkmann*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-steering speech enhancement pipeline using a particle filter with temporal feedback to achieve low-complexity tracking in dynamic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for enhancing speech in dynamic environments require computationally expensive tracking algorithms, limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce a causal sequential processing strategy that integrates temporal feedback and uses a particle filter to achieve resource-efficient tracking.

Result: Evaluation on synthetic datasets showed improved tracking accuracy and effective speech enhancement. Real-world listening tests also favored the proposed method over existing approaches.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that the proposed pipeline is a resource-efficient and effective solution for real-time speech enhancement in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Recent works on deep non-linear spatially selective filters demonstrate
exceptional enhancement performance with computationally lightweight
architectures for stationary speakers of known directions. However, to maintain
this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking
algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on
the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational
overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as
real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a
low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead.
Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback
to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to
compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter.
Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay
between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to
strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings
complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed
self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.

*Yalin E. Sagduyu,Kemal Davaslioglu,Tugba Erpek,Sastry Kompella,Gustave Anderson,Jonathan Ashdown*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a complete signal-processing workflow for using 5G Positioning Reference Signals (PRS) to enable integrated sensing and communication systems in a multistatic setup, achieving high precision in detection, positioning, and tracking of moving targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage 5G PRS signals for both sensing and communication purposes, improving moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking in multistatic ISAC systems.

Method: A distributed architecture with spatially separated receivers processes periodic 5G PRS waveforms to extract bistatic delays and radial velocity data. Nonlinear least-squares trilateration and linear inversion methods estimate geometric position and velocity vectors. Kalman filters refine the data output for smoother tracking.

Result: The approach successfully detects moving targets and estimates their position and velocity with high fidelity using 5G PRS signals.

Conclusion: 5G PRS signals are effective for multistatic ISAC applications, enabling accurate detection, position estimation, and tracking of multiple moving targets across 2D and 3D scenarios, even with synchronization bias and target association complexities.

Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference
Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits
a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers
exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and
tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a
range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are
extracted for every target. For a single target, the resulting bistatic delays
are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric
position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed
equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are
obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account
for time synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving
target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to
standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results
show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G
PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.

*Danish Mahmood,Stephanie Buczkowski,Sahaj Shah,Autumn Anthony,Rohini Desetty,Carlo R Bartoli*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper introduces tubuleTracker, a rapid and objective tool to analyze endothelial cell networks for angiogenesis studies, showing improvements over manual and ImageJ methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing angiogenesis networks are slow, subjective, and inaccurate, especially as networks become more complex.

Method: Human endothelial cells were cultured and their images analyzed using manual review, ImageJ, and tubuleTracker, assessing metrics like tubule count, length, and circularity.

Result: TubuleTracker significantly outperformed manual and ImageJ methods in speed, consistency, and effectively correlating with angiogenesis maturity metrics.

Conclusion: TubuleTracker demonstrated faster and more reliable analysis capabilities and is now available as free software, offering improved angiogenesis assessment tools for research.

Abstract: Background: In vitro endothelial cell culture is widely used to study
angiogenesis. Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed
manually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like
ImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as
endothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may
not fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed
tubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture
and maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired
using phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three
independent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics
included tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel
circularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis
maturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image
differed significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker
(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count
(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node
count (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across
angiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,
and circularity (all p<0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more
consistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity
proved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker
is available as free shareware for the biomedical research community.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study explores synthetic heuristic usability evaluation using multimodal large language models (LLMs) and compares their performance to human UX evaluators, finding they detect a high percentage of usability issues but have limitations in certain areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cost and expertise requirements of traditional usability evaluations by exploring AI-driven evaluations using multimodal LLMs.

Method: The study developed a synthetic heuristic evaluation method leveraging multimodal LLMs' design feedback capabilities and compared their usability issue detection rates with those of experienced UX practitioners over two applications.

Result: Synthetic evaluations detected 73% and 77% of usability issues, outperforming human evaluators who identified 57% and 63%. They excelled in identifying layout issues but struggled with UI recognition and cross-screen violations. Their performance was consistent over time and accounts.

Conclusion: Synthetic evaluations can be a promising and cost-effective alternative or complement to traditional usability testing, though their limitations must be addressed to improve overall reliability.

Abstract: Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly,
requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a
method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to
analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations
to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our
evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the
performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human
evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent
performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting
potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation.
However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and
design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations.
Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed
stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences
between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic
heuristic evaluations.

TL;DR: This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) handle emotionally rich and empathetic interactions by extending a manually crafted dataset using ChatGPT and Gemini, analyzing their responses through sentiment analysis and expert evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With conversational agents increasingly integrated into domains like healthcare and education, there is a growing need for emotional intelligence, particularly empathetic listening, to enhance their interactions.

Method: The study utilized a small, expert-crafted dataset to train LLMs (ChatGPT and Gemini) in emotional dialogues, analyzing their emotional progression using sentiment analysis (VADER) and human expert evaluation.

Result: The LLMs generated conversations that largely reflected the intended emotional structure, but human evaluation highlighted differences in perceived empathy and coherence.

Conclusion: Emotion modeling in dialogues requires more than structural emotional alignment; qualitative depth and a combination of automated and human-centered methods are crucial for developing emotionally competent conversational agents.

Abstract: Conversational agents have made significant progress since ELIZA, expanding
their role across various domains, including healthcare, education, and
customer service. As these agents become increasingly integrated into daily
human interactions, the need for emotional intelligence, particularly
empathetic listening, becomes increasingly essential. In this study, we explore
how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond when tasked with generating
emotionally rich interactions. Starting from a small dataset manually crafted
by an expert to reflect empathic behavior, we extended the conversations using
two LLMs: ChatGPT and Gemini. We analyzed the emotional progression of the
dialogues using both sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments.
While the generated conversations often mirrored the intended emotional
structure, human evaluation revealed important differences in the perceived
empathy and coherence of the responses. These findings suggest that emotion
modeling in dialogues requires not only structural alignment in the expressed
emotions but also qualitative depth, highlighting the importance of combining
automated and humancentered methods in the development of emotionally competent
agents.

*Luke Guerdan,Devansh Saxena,Stevie Chancellor,Zhiwei Steven Wu,Kenneth Holstein*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores how data scientists construct target variables for predictive modeling tasks, focusing on a bricolage process balancing objectives and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how data scientists address the challenge of translating fuzzy concepts into concrete target variables for predictive modeling, especially in fields like education and healthcare.

Method: Conducting interviews with 15 data scientists in the education and healthcare domains to analyze their process for constructing target variables.

Result: Data scientists construct target variables iteratively through a bricolage process, balancing criteria like validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and resource requirements.

Conclusion: The study reveals strategies data scientists use for target variable construction and proposes research opportunities to enhance support for this complex process in HCI, CSCW, and ML domains.

Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy,
hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the
"healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists
translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly
understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and
healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for
predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct
target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation
between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints.
Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable
through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and
resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem
(re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable
for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g.,
predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable
to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings,
we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better
support the art and science of target variable construction.

Motivation: To improve semantic exploration and reasoning in recommender systems, addressing limitations of fixed curvature and rigid embeddings.

Method: It models users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres, with a curvature-aware semantic kernel enabling multi-hop inference.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show enhanced NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to baselines.

Conclusion: ManifoldMind offers trustworthy, transparent recommendations with improved calibration and conceptual exploration in abstract domains.

Abstract: We introduce ManifoldMind, a probabilistic geometric recommender system for
exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space. Unlike
prior methods with fixed curvature and rigid embeddings, ManifoldMind
represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres,
enabling personalised uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware semantic
exploration. A curvature-aware semantic kernel supports soft, multi-hop
inference, allowing the model to explore diverse conceptual paths instead of
overfitting to shallow or direct interactions. Experiments on four public

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces HyFairCRS, a framework for enhancing fairness and diversity in Conversational Recommender Systems using hypergraph contrastive multi-interest learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender Systems often face fairness issues such as bias over time, leading to problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers.

Method: The proposed HyFairCRS framework employs hypergraph-based contrastive learning to capture diverse user interests and uses these interests to ensure fair responses and item predictions in dynamic Conversational Recommender Systems.

Result: Experiments on two datasets demonstrated that HyFairCRS achieves state-of-the-art performance and reduces unfairness in recommendations.

Conclusion: HyFairCRS presents an effective solution to enhance fairness and mitigate biased outcomes in dynamic, interactive recommender systems.

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This study explores how labeling disagreements between two large language models (LLaMA and Qwen) impact downstream information retrieval, finding that such disagreements are systematic and structured.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the impact of labeling disagreements between large language models on document relevance, particularly in domains without human-labeled data.

Method: Analyze labeling disagreement on scholarly abstracts related to specific Sustainable Development Goals using lexical property evaluation, rank-order assessment, and classification predictability tests.

Result: Disagreement cases show consistent lexical patterns, divergent ranked outputs, and classification predictability with AUCs above 0.74, indicating that disagreements are systematic and structured.

Conclusion: LLM filtering introduces systematic variability in document retrieval, suggesting the need to analyze classification disagreement in retrieval evaluation for thematic or policy-relevant tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assign document
relevance labels in information retrieval pipelines, especially in domains
lacking human-labeled data. However, different models often disagree on
borderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects
downstream retrieval. This study examines labeling disagreement between two
open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7. We isolate disagreement
subsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and
classification predictability. Our results show that model disagreement is
systematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns,
produce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are
distinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers. These findings
suggest that LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document
retrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic. We propose
using classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval
evaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks.

Motivation: Traditional recommendation systems using collaborative filtering face difficulties with sparse user interaction in music, requiring alternative methods for better recommendations.

Method: The paper reviews methods such as lyrical analysis via Large Language Models and audio signal processing for improving song classification in content filtering.

Result: The review highlights strengths, limitations, and potential conflicts of various content filtering methods and discusses their applicability in overcoming biases in music recommendation systems.

Conclusion: Content filtering, particularly using advanced methods like LLMs and audio processing, can complement collaborative filtering by addressing music streaming challenges, though conflicts and biases need resolution.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become essential in modern music streaming
platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common
approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests
content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to
the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where
interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a
music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due
to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with
other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing
these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in
mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore
various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical
analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing
techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these
different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such
discrepancies.

### [319] [Listwise Preference Alignment Optimization for Tail Item Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02255)
*Zihao Li,Chao Yang,Tong Zhang,Yakun Chen,Xianzhi Wang,Guandong Xu,Daoyi Dong*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces LPO4Rec, a method for efficient listwise preference alignment in item recommendation, prioritizing tail items and improving performance over existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for preference alignment in recommendation systems either result in high computational costs due to explicit reward modeling or are limited by pairwise preference comparison, and none address the issue of tail-item recommendation effectively.

Method: LPO4Rec extends the Bradley-Terry model to listwise comparison, deriving a closed-form optimal policy to avoid explicit reward modeling, and employs adaptive negative sampling and reweighting to focus on tail items.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show that LPO4Rec significantly outperforms 10 baselines, achieving up to 50% performance improvement and reducing GPU memory usage by 17.9%.

Conclusion: LPO4Rec offers an efficient and scalable solution for preference alignment in recommendation systems, particularly enhancing the performance for tail-item recommendations.

Abstract: Preference alignment has achieved greater success on Large Language Models
(LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference
alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or
only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases
substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency
on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference
alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we
propose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison
to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training.
Specifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient
and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an
adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items
during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations.
Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference
optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the
optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method
outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance
improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct
preference optimization (DPO) in tail-item recommendation. Our code is

### [320] [Resolving Turbulent Magnetohydrodynamics: A Hybrid Operator-Diffusion Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02106)
*Semih Kacmaz,E. A. Huerta,Roland Haas*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid machine learning framework combining Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) with diffusion models to simulate 2D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a wide range of Reynolds numbers, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a framework that can simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of MHD turbulence with high fidelity, addressing the challenge of capturing both low-frequency dynamics and high-frequency residuals in regimes previously inaccessible to deterministic models.

Method: The framework integrates PINOs for low-frequency dynamics and a conditional score-based generative diffusion model for stochastic corrections to high-frequency residuals, and is trained on a dataset spanning a wide range of Reynolds numbers.

Result: The model achieves accurate predictions, faithfully reconstructing spectral energy distributions, non-Gaussian statistics, and cross-field correlations even at very high Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$ = 10,000), which were beyond the reach of previous surrogate models.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework represents significant progress in simulating MHD turbulence, providing a robust tool for studying high-Reynolds-number turbulence and enabling statistically meaningful predictions across a broad spectrum of dynamics.

Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed
Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to
simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible,
resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds
numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained
generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency
dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects
high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed
turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations
with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to
deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model
faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity
and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian
statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high
fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the
first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the
magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically
meaningful predictions.

### [321] [Real-time Image-based Lighting of Glints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02674)
*Tom Kneiphof,Reinhard Klein*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time method for rendering glittering materials under dynamic lighting using efficient environment map filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of rendering sparkling or glittering appearances of materials under real-world lighting conditions in a computationally efficient manner.

Method: The proposed method filters environment maps into regions of constant radiance, calculates microfacet reflection probabilities using a normal distribution function, and applies a multinomial sampling method using a dual-gated Gaussian approximation.

Result: The method achieves real-time performance with rendering results close to ground-truth, requiring only minimal memory overhead compared to traditional single-directional light rendering.

Conclusion: This approach provides an efficient and robust solution for real-time glint rendering, making it feasible for dynamic lighting and material properties in real-time applications.

Abstract: Image-based lighting is a widely used technique to reproduce shading under
real-world lighting conditions, especially in real-time rendering applications.
A particularly challenging scenario involves materials exhibiting a sparkling
or glittering appearance, caused by discrete microfacets scattered across their
surface. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based
lighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment
maps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area
light illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques.
Crucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be
executed on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is
partitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the
corresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we
obtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each
region. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically
sample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian
approximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time
approximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material
properties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable
performance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single
directional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our
approach requires twice as much memory to store the prefiltered environment
map.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper explores DNN-assisted codeword selection for maximizing throughput in mmWave MIMO systems enhanced by RIS, addressing computational inefficiencies in traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to tackle the high computational complexity and inefficiency in RIS-aided mmWave MIMO systems, particularly with codebook design for optimal precoding.

Method: A trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to simplify and accelerate codeword selection, while permuted DFT vectors are used for near-optimal codebook design with discrete phase shifts.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that using DNN achieves sub-optimal spectral efficiency even with varying distances between the end-user and RIS, outperforming the traditional exhaustive search methods.

Conclusion: The DNN approach is a promising solution for enhancing spectral efficiency and computational speed in RIS-assisted mmWave MIMO systems.

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a context-aware attack data generator for representing various cyberattack scenarios in connected vehicles, validated using an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing risks of cybersecurity in connected vehicles and constraints on testing real-world attack scenarios necessitate cost-effective methods for generating high-quality attack data.

Method: The paper presents a context-aware data generator that uses parameterized attack models with CAN message decoding and adjustable attack intensity to simulate attack scenarios (e.g., DoS, spoofing, replay).

Result: The generated data was evaluated in an IDS case study involving deep neural network models. These models showed high detection and classification performance, validating the data's quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of creating realistic attack scenario data, aiding in the development of adaptive intrusion detection systems for connected vehicles.

Abstract: The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks
emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures
such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of
attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms
that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of
ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on
implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and
ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack
scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective
methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper
presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and
corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,
representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,
spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack
models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to
configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and
promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated
attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,
in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural
network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and
scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high
detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also
elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world
scenarios and provide insights into its application.

*Artur Zolkowski,Kei Nishimura-Gasparian,Robert McCarthy,Roland S. Zimmermann,David Lindner*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can encode hidden information (steganography) in their outputs, posing risks for misuse and evasion of monitoring systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about misuse and evasion by LLMs through steganographic techniques and assess their potential risks.

Method: Evaluation of frontier LLMs in encoding hidden messages and reasoning through specific schemes, with and without monitoring affordances.

Result: Current LLMs show limited ability to hide encoded messages or reasoning unless specific affordances are provided.

Conclusion: While current LLMs show nascent steganographic abilities, they are unlikely to evade well-designed monitoring systems at present. Future risks may emerge as capabilities evolve.

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a framework exploiting vulnerabilities in aligned LLMs to covertly generate malware through modular decomposition. It outperforms existing methods and highlights significant risks to AI system security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose and address the significant security concern of LLMs being covertly exploited to generate malicious software despite alignment safeguards.

Method: MGC utilizes a Malware Description Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to modularly break down malicious intents into benign-looking sub-tasks, bypassing existing alignment mechanisms in LLMs.

Result: MGC demonstrates significantly improved performance in generating functional malware—365.79% better than jailbreaking methods and 78.07% better than underground services. It also reproduces and enhances 16 real-world malware examples.

Conclusion: The study highlights the vulnerability of LLMs to compositional attacks despite alignment safeguards, offering critical insights for improving AI security.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have democratized software development, reducing
the expertise barrier for programming complex applications. This accessibility
extends to malicious software development, raising significant security
concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent
direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly
evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability:
malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing
sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a
novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition
and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description
Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and
benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications
and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground
services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies
further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware
samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by
exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

### [326] [Can Artificial Intelligence solve the blockchain oracle problem? Unpacking the Challenges and Possibilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02125)
*Giulio Caldarelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses how AI can assist in improving blockchain oracle systems but emphasizes it cannot fully solve the problem of unverifiable off-chain inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the blockchain oracle problem, a critical obstacle in creating trustless applications, by examining the potential of AI-based solutions.

Method: The authors analyze AI techniques like anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, and adversarial resistance, leveraging insights from academic and implementation practices.

Result: AI enhances data quality, source selection, and resilience of oracle systems but cannot eliminate reliance on unverifiable off-chain data.

Conclusion: AI serves as a complementary tool in oracle design but cannot replace underlying trust assumptions for off-chain data.

Abstract: The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting
reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental
limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years
have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic
strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the
fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain
world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial
intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both
academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI
techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic
reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We
observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality,
source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on
unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI
should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within
a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces EIM-TRNG, a hardware-based true random number generator leveraging DRAM randomness caused by RowHammer to secure DNN weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for safeguarding AI system parameters, particularly DNN weights, with robust hardware-based true random number generation that outperforms pseudo-random software methods.

Method: The proposed EIM-TRNG utilizes unpredictable bit-flips generated by RowHammer operations in DRAM to create a reliable entropy source and further secure DNN weights through encoding and encryption methods.

Result: Results validate the effective use of DRAM-based entropy for true random number generation and a practical application in securing machine learning models.

Conclusion: The EIM-TRNG offers a low-cost, robust, and innovative hardware security solution for protecting AI models and securing their weights at the hardware level.

Abstract: True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a fundamental role in hardware
security, cryptographic systems, and data protection. In the context of Deep
NeuralNetworks (DNNs), safeguarding model parameters, particularly weights, is
critical to ensure the integrity, privacy, and intel-lectual property of AI
systems. While software-based pseudo-random number generators are widely used,
they lack the unpredictability and resilience offered by hardware-based TRNGs.
In this work, we propose a novel and robust Encoding-in-Memory TRNG called
EIM-TRNG that leverages the inherent physical randomness in DRAM cell behavior,
particularly under RowHammer-induced disturbances, for the first time. We
demonstrate how the unpredictable bit-flips generated through carefully
controlled RowHammer operations can be harnessed as a reliable entropy source.
Furthermore, we apply this TRNG framework to secure DNN weight data by encoding
via a combination of fixed and unpredictable bit-flips. The encrypted data is
later decrypted using a key derived from the probabilistic flip behavior,
ensuring both data confidentiality and model authenticity. Our results validate
the effectiveness of DRAM-based entropy extraction for robust, low-cost
hardware security and offer a promising direction for protecting machine
learning models at the hardware level.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting anomalies and recommending mitigations in IoT security logs, outperforming classical machine learning models in multi-class classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to enhance cybersecurity in IoT systems by leveraging logs for threat detection and providing actionable recommendations for mitigating these threats.

Method: The approach compares open-source LLMs with classical models for anomaly detection using IoT data. It employs zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning techniques and maps threats to a cyber framework (MITRE CAPEC) to provide mitigation recommendations.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs outperform baseline models in multi-class attack classification and can offer threat detection along with specific mitigation guidance after training with IoT-specific data.

Conclusion: Integrating fine-tuned LLMs in IoT cybersecurity pipelines is effective for both anomaly detection and providing actionable recommendations, making them valuable tools for IoT security management.

Abstract: Log analysis is a relevant research field in cybersecurity as they can
provide a source of information for the detection of threats to networks and
systems. This paper presents a pipeline to use fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) for anomaly detection and mitigation recommendation using IoT security
logs. Utilizing classical machine learning classifiers as a baseline, three
open-source LLMs are compared for binary and multiclass anomaly detection, with
three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot prompting and fine-tuning using an IoT
dataset. LLMs give better results on multi-class attack classification than the
corresponding baseline models. By mapping detected threats to MITRE CAPEC,
defining a set of IoT-specific mitigation actions, and fine-tuning the models
with those actions, the models are able to provide a combined detection and
recommendation guidance.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CyberRAG introduces an agent-based RAG system to improve intrusion detection with high accuracy, better explanations, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overwhelming volume of alerts in IDS/IPS systems and to tackle issues with high false-positive rates and poor justification in conventional systems.

Method: CyberRAG uses a modular, agent-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. It orchestrates fine-tuned attack classifiers, context enrichment tools, and iterative retrieval loops to ensure relevant and self-consistent evidence.

Result: CyberRAG achieved over 94% accuracy per attack class, a final classification accuracy of 94.92%, and high-quality explanations scoring up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in expert evaluations.

Conclusion: CyberRAG provides a scalable and practical semi-autonomous cybersecurity solution, delivering high detection accuracy, reliable justifications, and adaptability for emerging threats.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can
generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security
analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise.
Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield
high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to
justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,
a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,
explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent
orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to
a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and
(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a
domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and
self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic
design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This
agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language
justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing
interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be
supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.
CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing
final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.
Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based
expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can
pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a
practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Meta SecAlign, the first open-source LLM with built-in defenses against prompt injection attacks, achieving results comparable to closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security threats of prompt injection attacks and the current closed-source nature of defenses, the paper aims to drive progress in AI security through open-source collaboration.

Method: The researchers developed Meta SecAlign using an improved SecAlign defense mechanism and trained it on a generic instruction-tuning dataset, detailing the training recipe.

Result: The model performed well on 9 utility benchmarks and 7 security benchmarks, demonstrating robustness in various tasks, including unseen ones like tool-calling and web navigation.

Conclusion: Meta SecAlign advances open-source AI security by providing both strong defenses against prompt injection attacks and competitive performance, fostering future open research.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated
applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are
currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We
believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where
co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific
progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we
develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in
model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We
provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved
version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7
security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic
instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,
including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general
instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable
utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for systematic and granular tools to detect AI-related disclosures in financial services has driven this research, addressing the shortcomings in precision, interpretability, and robustness of traditional methods.

Method: A domain-adapted transformer model, FinAI-BERT, is fine-tuned using a curated dataset of 1,586 sentences from annual reports of U.S. banks, leveraging SHAP-based interpretability and comprehensive robustness checks.

Result: FinAI-BERT achieved exceptional performance metrics, with 99.37% accuracy and a 0.993 F1 score, outperforming baseline models. It demonstrated stability across variable conditions, such as sentence lengths and adversarial inputs.

Conclusion: The study contributes to financial NLP with a fine-tuned domain-specific model and provides a scalable, transparent tool for monitoring AI-related disclosures in financial sectors.

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has
prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related
disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword
expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity,
interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a
domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related
content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned
on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669
annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect
classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993),
outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based
token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the
model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal
samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing
fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures.
Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts,
regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI
across financial institutions.
