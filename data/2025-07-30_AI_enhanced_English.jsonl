However, traditional map construction models provide\ndeterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent\nambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane\nmarkings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages\nthe diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized\nmaps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,\nMapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a\nBEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows\naggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty\nestimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments\non the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in\nsingle-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples\nconsistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit\nof distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are\nsignificantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying\nregions with ambiguous sensor input.
