### [1] [Bridging Natural Language and ASP: A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs and AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08715)
*Connar Hite,Sean Saud,Raef Taha,Nayim Rahman,Tanvir Atahary,Scott Douglass,Tarek Taha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to translate unrestricted English into ASP programs using LLMs and AMR graphs to solve logic puzzles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable non-programmers to create ASP programs for combinatorial problems using natural language input.

Method: The system uses LLMs for simplifying text and generating simple ASP elements, while AMR graphs systematically handle constraints and more complex structures.

Result: The proposed system successfully generates ASP programs to address combinatorial logic puzzles.

Conclusion: This is a significant step toward creating explainable systems that simplify converting natural language into functional logic-solving programs.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

### [2] [Vector Symbolic Algebras for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08747)
*Isaac Joffe,Chris Eliasmith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cognitively plausible solver for the ARC-AGI benchmark, combining neurosymbolic methods with Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs) to mimic human intelligence mechanisms. The solver shows some success on ARC-AGI and outperforms GPT-4 on simpler benchmarks with low computation cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty of solving the ARC-AGI intelligence benchmark, which is effortlessly solved by humans but remains highly challenging for current AI systems. The goal is to create a more cognitively informed AI solution.

Method: The method involves integrating human-like reasoning approaches (System 1 and System 2) using neurosymbolic methods and VSAs for object-centric program synthesis. VSAs are used to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable neural learning in a computationally efficient manner.

Result: The proposed solver achieves a performance of 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. It performs strongly on simpler benchmarks, achieving 94.5% accuracy on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC, outperforming GPT-4 on the latter.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their novel use of VSAs for ARC-AGI is unique and represents the most cognitively plausible solver for this task to date, presenting promising results that are computationally efficient. They share their code for further exploration.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ijoffe/ARC-VSA-2025.

### [3] [Interpretable by Design: Query-Specific Neural Modules for Explainable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08749)
*Mehrdad Zakershahrak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), an architecture designed to treat diverse queries in reinforcement learning as first-class aspects, enabling high inference accuracy independent of control performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning (RL) systems implicitly encode a wealth of knowledge about the environment but are not designed to expose or utilize this information efficiently for diverse queries.

Method: The authors propose the QDIN architecture, which uses specialized neural modules optimized for queries like policy, reachability, paths, and comparisons, and ensures query-specific accuracy while decoupling the representations used for inference and control.

Result: QDIN achieves near-perfect inference accuracy (99% reachability IoU) despite suboptimal control performance (31% return). It outperforms unified models and post-hoc extraction methods in handling diverse queries, maintaining competitive control efficiency.

Conclusion: This research presents RL systems as optimizable knowledge bases and highlights opportunities for reinterpretability, verification, and enhanced human-AI collaboration, setting a new course for query-focused RL development.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

### [4] [Neural Value Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08825)
*Yang You,Ufuk Çakır,Alex Schutz,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Value Iteration, which uses neural networks to represent the value function of POMDPs, addressing scalability challenges in large problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches for solving POMDPs (e.g., point-based value iteration) encounter computational challenges as the size of the problem increases due to the complexity of working with $α$-vectors.

Method: The authors propose representing the POMDP value function as a finite set of neural networks, leveraging their generalization capabilities within the value iteration framework to solve large-scale POMDPs.

Result: This novel representation, combined with Neural Value Iteration, allows for solving extremely large POMDPs while achieving near-optimal solutions.

Conclusion: Neural networks provide a scalable alternative for representing value functions in POMDPs, enabling the effective handling of problems that were previously intractable using traditional methods.

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

### [5] [UCO: A Multi-Turn Interactive Reinforcement Learning Method for Adaptive Teaching with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08873)
*Shouang Wei,Min Zhang,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Kun Kuang,Zhongxiang Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to improve large language models as educational tutors, enabling dynamic, adaptive teaching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods in educational large language models struggle to evaluate genuine student understanding and fail to adapt dynamically to students' cognitive states.

Method: The UCO method uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm with dual reward functions: Progress Reward to track cognitive improvement and Scaffold Reward to adapt teaching within the student's Zone of Proximal Development.

Result: The UCO method outperformed 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks, achieving comparable performance to advanced proprietary models.

Conclusion: UCO effectively addresses key challenges in adapting large language models as intelligent tutors, advancing both student understanding tracking and dynamic teaching adaptations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

### [6] [Lumine: An Open Recipe for Building Generalist Agents in 3D Open Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08892)
*Weihao Tan,Xiangyang Li,Yunhao Fang,Heyuan Yao,Shi Yan,Hao Luo,Tenglong Ao,Huihui Li,Hongbin Ren,Bairen Yi,Yujia Qin,Bo An,Libin Liu,Guang Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lumine is a vision-language-powered generalist agent capable of complex missions in 3D environments, demonstrating strong in-domain performance and cross-game generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generalist AI agent capable of handling complex, hours-long missions in real-time within open-ended 3D worlds, comparable to human-level capabilities.

Method: Introduced a vision-language model processing real-time pixel data, producing high-frequency actions and adaptive reasoning for tasks in challenging environments like Genshin Impact.

Result: Lumine achieved human-level efficiency in the Genshin Impact storyline, followed natural language instructions, performed diverse tasks, and demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization in other games like Wuthering Waves and Honkai: Star Rail.

Conclusion: Lumine's development establishes a key advancement in creating generalist agents for open-world environments, showcasing effective capabilities across multiple games and dynamic scenarios without further fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

### [7] [The Double Contingency Problem: AI Recursion and the Limits of Interspecies Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08927)
*Graham L. Bishop*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses how current bioacoustic AI systems might distort animal communication due to inherent recursive cognition in both AI and species' communication. It advocates for AI design revisions to engage diplomatically with ecological signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current bioacoustic AI systems that ignore the recursive cognitive dynamics in both AI systems and animal communication, potentially distorting ecological communicative structures.

Method: The method involves philosophical analysis of recursive cognition, referencing Yuk Hui's theories, and proposes reframing AI systems as diplomatic agents rather than neutral detectors.

Result: The paper identifies double contingency problems in both species-specific communication and AI processing, showing how ecological and computational contingencies interact and may obscure signals.

Conclusion: A rethinking of bioacoustic AI systems is necessary to account for recursive cognition, suggesting design changes to move beyond universal pattern recognition toward building diplomatic bioacoustic systems.

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

### [9] [AlphaCast: A Human Wisdom-LLM Intelligence Co-Reasoning Framework for Interactive Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08947)
*Xiaohan Zhang,Tian Gao,Mingyue Cheng,Bokai Pan,Ze Guo,Yaguo Liu,Xiaoyu Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlphaCast, an interactive forecasting framework combining human expertise and LLM intelligence to improve predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting approaches lack interaction, reasoning, and adaptability, limiting their effectiveness in complex real-world tasks.

Method: AlphaCast employs a two-stage process: automated prediction preparation (including multi-source foundation building) and generative reasoning (meta-reasoning loop for self-correction).

Result: AlphaCast demonstrated superior predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various datasets.

Conclusion: Interactive collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence significantly enhances forecasting capabilities.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

### [10] [Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Assumption-Based Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08982)
*Preesha Gehlot,Anna Rapberger,Fabrizio Russo,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods to approximate stable semantics in Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for stable semantics in ABA are computationally infeasible for large frameworks, necessitating scalable approximation techniques.

Method: The authors propose two GNN architectures, ABAGCN and ABAGAT, using a dependency graph representation of ABA frameworks. Models are trained with ICCMA 2023 benchmark data, with parameter optimization using Bayesian search.

Result: ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform state-of-the-art GNN baselines, achieving a node-level F1 score up to 0.71 on ICCMA instances and enabling reconstruction of stable extensions with high accuracy on small and moderate-sized frameworks.

Conclusion: This work proposes GNN-based approaches, opening the door for scalable and efficient approximate reasoning in structured argumentation frameworks.

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

### [11] [AI Founding Fathers: A Case Study of GIS Search in Multi-Agent Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09005)
*Alvin Chauhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes that reasoning in LLMs is best enhanced using a structured multi-agent pipeline optimized for a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) search via recursive refinement (RR). Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of this approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by finding a systematic and structured way to make LLM computations and search processes more effective and controlled.

Method: They propose recursive refinement (RR)—using iterative self-criticism, stress-testing, and feedback integration—implemented via a complex multi-agent pipeline to execute GIS search. This was tested on models representing historical personas responding to political issues.

Result: The complex multi-agent pipeline using recursive refinement outperformed a simpler model in all tests, achieving higher scores (88.3 vs 71.7) and superior argument quality.

Conclusion: Recursive refinement is a promising and robust architectural solution for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs through controlled and structured search processes.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

### [12] [Solving a Million-Step LLM Task with Zero Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09030)
*Elliot Meyerson,Giuseppe Paolo,Roberto Dailey,Hormoz Shahrzad,Olivier Francon,Conor F. Hayes,Xin Qiu,Babak Hodjat,Risto Miikkulainen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to execute tasks requiring extensive logical steps due to persistent errors. This paper introduces MAKER, a system using extreme task decomposition and multi-agent error correction, successfully solving over one million steps without errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers aim to overcome LLM limitations in handling extended processes and long-range tasks, caused by frequent derailments after multiple dependent steps.

Method: MAKER employs extreme decomposition of tasks into subtasks handled by microagents, leveraging multi-agent voting for error correction at every step.

Result: MAKER achieves error-free completion of tasks involving over one million LLM steps and demonstrates scalability far beyond this level.

Conclusion: Massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs), rather than solely relying on LLM improvements, offer scalable solutions for complex and large-scale problems.

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

### [13] [Argus: Resilience-Oriented Safety Assurance Framework for End-to-End ADSs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09032)
*Dingji Wang,You Lu,Bihuan Chen,Shuo Hao,Haowen Jiang,Yifan Tian,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Argus is a framework proposed to enhance the resilience of end-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs) by monitoring driving hazards and taking adaptive actions to prevent safety violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the lack of resilience in existing ADSs to adaptively respond to driving hazards, which is critical for maintaining robust performance in complex scenarios.

Method: A framework, called Argus, is designed to monitor ADS-generated trajectories for hazards and take control through a built-in hazard mitigator when potential safety violations are detected. It is integrated with three state-of-the-art ADSs (TCP, UniAD, VAD).

Result: Argus significantly improves resilience by enhancing the driving score of ADSs by up to 150.30% on average, preventing 64.38% of safety violations, and adding minimal time overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, Argus, proves effective in monitoring and alleviating hazards in ADSs while improving safety and performance without sacrificing time efficiency.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional Reinforcement Learning paradigms, such as poor sample efficiency and lack of adaptability, and improve AV performance in dynamic emergency situations.

Method: The paper analyzes AV optimization via DM-augmented RL for robust policy development through synthetic data generation, and LLM-assisted ICL for rapid adaptation without retraining.

Result: DM-augmented RL improves robustness but adds computational complexity, while LLM-assisted ICL provides a lightweight, adaptive alternative for AV intelligence in emergencies.

Conclusion: Integrating DM-augmented RL and LLM-assisted ICL into AV systems can enhance their efficiency, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities, shaping the next generation of autonomous emergency response vehicles.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

*Zezhen Ding,Zhen Tan,Jiheng Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OR-R1, a framework that effectively automates optimization modeling using limited data, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal annotation requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of translating natural language problem descriptions into optimization models and solver code, which is currently expertise-intensive and requires large amounts of annotated data.

Method: OR-R1 employs a two-stage approach: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for reasoning and code generation from limited labeled data, and Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) to enhance performance and consistency using abundant unlabeled data.

Result: OR-R1 achieves a problem-solving accuracy of 67.7%, requiring only 1/10th the data used by prior methods and outperforming previous systems like ORLM by up to 4.2%. It also demonstrates significant accuracy gains with minimal synthetic samples.

Conclusion: OR-R1 offers a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automating optimization modeling, reducing both expertise and data requirements for real-world applications.

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

### [16] [History-Aware Reasoning for GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09127)
*Ziwei Wang,Leyang Yang,Xiaoxuan Tang,Sheng Zhou,Dajun Chen,Wei Jiang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework to enhance episodic reasoning for GUI agents, addressing their weak history-awareness during long-horizon tasks, and successfully demonstrates its efficacy using HAR-GUI-3B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents struggle with episodic reasoning due to weak short-term memory and inability to connect historical interactions across screen chains, limiting their performance in complex automation tasks.

Method: Proposes a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework involving reflective learning, tailored correction guidelines, and hybrid RL reward functions to improve episodic reasoning. Introduces HAR-GUI-3B model for history-awareness.

Result: Experiments show HAR-GUI-3B effectively improves short-term memory and reasoning for GUI agents, achieving better performances in diverse GUI-related benchmarks.

Conclusion: The HAR framework successfully addresses the history-agnostic reasoning problem in GUI agents, enhancing their episodic reasoning and making them more effective for long-horizon task automation.

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

*Leyang Yang,Ziwei Wang,Xiaoxuan Tang,Sheng Zhou,Dajun Chen,Wei Jiang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating GUI agents, emphasizing process-related task evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate GUI agents based on the final task state, missing critical intermediate steps and process information.

Method: Developed a benchmark named ProBench with over 200 GUI tasks, incorporating both state and process-related evaluations, using a Process Provider for accurate process tracking.

Result: ProBench showed significant limitations in current GUI agent models, identifying universal errors across diverse models.

Conclusion: ProBench highlights key challenges in GUI agent performance, offering new directions for improvement in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to reduce verbose reasoning responses in large reasoning models, improving both accuracy and token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of overthinking in large reasoning models, which generates verbose and redundant responses, leading to high computational costs.

Method: The authors propose a training pipeline for a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) and a Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) to optimize concise reasoning while reducing training issues such as length collapse and training collapse.

Result: Their approach achieved an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B, and generalized well across other models like Llama and Mistral.

Conclusion: The proposed CRM and CRF significantly enhance reasoning efficiency and effectiveness, with superior theoretical and practical outcomes. The code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

*Niclas Flehmig,Mary Ann Lundteigen,Shen Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the reliability challenges of agentic AI systems, especially in high-risk domains, and proposes a two-layered monitoring framework to mitigate potential risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems have potential in various fields, but their reliability issues make them unsuitable for high-risk applications like healthcare and process industries.

Method: The authors identify reliability challenges during the operation of agentic AI systems, draw parallels with traditional AI systems, and propose a two-layer framework combining out-of-distribution detection and AI transparency.

Result: The two-layered monitoring framework highlights unreliable outputs and supports human operators in decision-making to mitigate risks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework forms a foundation for addressing reliability issues in agentic AI systems, enabling safer deployment and operation.

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series data using a novel multiplicative embedding fusion module for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in modeling irregular clinical time series from EHRs where existing additive fusion strategies fail to sufficiently capture value-dependent feature interactions.

Method: Proposed MedFuse with the MuFuse module, a multiplicative approach to fuse value and feature embeddings, preserving specific information and modeling higher-order interactions.

Result: MedFuse outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks on predictive tasks across three real-world datasets and supports cross-dataset pretraining.

Conclusion: MedFuse is a generalizable and effective approach for handling irregular clinical time series, improving both predictive accuracy and representational expressiveness.

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

*Minlan Shao,Zijian Zhang,Yili Wang,Yiwei Dai,Xu Shen,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyperD is a novel framework for traffic forecasting that decouples data into periodic and residual components, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in traffic forecasting due to complex spatial dependencies and coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns with irregular fluctuations.

Method: HyperD utilizes a Hybrid Periodic Representation Module to process periodic patterns and a Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module for residual fluctuations, with Dual-View Alignment Loss ensuring semantic separation.

Result: Experiments on four real-world datasets show HyperD outperforms other methods in accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HyperD successfully addresses traffic forecasting challenges, offering superior performance and efficiency for intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

*Roland Aydin,Christian Cyron,Steve Bachelor,Ashton Anderson,Robert West*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shift from training AI models post-development to embedding alignment with human values during the model's initial development stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models often lack deep integration of human values as alignment processes occur after their core capabilities are established.

Method: The method involves redesigning the training data corpus by incorporating first-person perspectives, contextualizing information as lived experiences, simulating social interactions, and structuring the sequence of training data.

Result: Through this approach, models may gain an intrinsic alignment with human values from the onset of their training, making these values more inseparable from their learned capabilities.

Conclusion: Integrating alignment early is vital in the context of increasingly capable AI models to ensure their behavior and capabilities are intrinsically linked to human values.

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for developing AI systems tailored to qualitative research needs, addressing limitations of general-purpose tools in interpretive studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in AI for quantitative research, qualitative research has lagged in adopting tailored AI tools, with researchers relying on insufficient general-purpose systems like ChatGPT.

Method: The authors analyze literature, discuss the limitations of current tools, and suggest designing transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly qualitative AI systems.

Result: Highlighting a gap in qualitative research tools, the study identifies how AI could adapt interpretive methods for multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Conclusion: Dedicated AI systems for qualitative research are essential for advancing research methodologies and integrating qualitative dimensions into scientific discovery.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based framework for barrier certificate synthesis in dynamical systems, achieving over 90% success in certificate generation and releasing a benchmark, BarrierBench, for community testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous systems require robust safety verification methods, but current approaches to synthesizing barrier certificates lack scalability and depend heavily on manual expertise.

Method: The authors employ a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and verify barrier certificates, integrating these insights with SMT-based validation and co-synthesis of safety certificates and controllers.

Result: The approach was evaluated using BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems, achieving high reliability and performance with over 90% success in generating valid barrier certificates.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the practicality of using LLMs for synthesizing barrier certificates, and by releasing BarrierBench, it supports further research into language-driven formal verification methods.

Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.

TL;DR: The study evaluates the reasoning and planning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs (DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and GPT-5) using PDDL tasks, highlighting GPT-5's competitive performance compared to specialized planners like LAMA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the progress and capabilities of advanced LLMs in reasoning and planning tasks, with a focus on measuring how they compare to dedicated planning solvers.

Method: The researchers tested the reasoning and planning capabilities of three advanced LLMs and one reference planner (LAMA) using a subset of domains from the International Planning Competition's Learning Track. The evaluation compared their performance generating plans from PDDL descriptions, with additional assessments on obfuscated tasks.

Result: GPT-5 performed competitively with the specialized planner LAMA on standard PDDL domains. Although LLM performance decreased on obfuscated domains, the degradation was less severe than observed in previous model generations.

Conclusion: Recent LLMs, particularly GPT-5, demonstrate significant advancements in reasoning and planning capabilities, reducing the performance gap with specialized planners on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of accessing critical information within learned representations for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains.

Method: The proposed method employs latent flow matching guided by classifier-free principles to explicitly separate conditioning information from residual representations, enabling better feature disentanglement.

Conclusion: This approach provides a simple yet effective way to analyze and repurpose latent representations, highlighting its potential in leveraging generative models for scientific applications and exploration.

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrochetBench is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models' ability to perform detailed procedural reasoning in crochet tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing benchmarks that focus on high-level descriptions rather than actionable procedural reasoning, specifically within the creative domain of crochet.

Method: The benchmark uses a CrochetPARADE DSL for structural validation and functional evaluation. It includes tasks like stitch classification, instruction grounding, and translations from natural language or images into the DSL.

Result: Performance of models significantly drops when moving from superficial similarity to executable correctness, highlighting deficiencies in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis.

Conclusion: CrochetBench provides insights into procedural competence in multimodal models, revealing a disconnect between surface understanding and executable precision in creative domains.

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

### [28] [Consensus Sampling for Safer Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09493)
*Adam Tauman Kalai,Yael Tauman Kalai,Or Zamir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new architecture-agnostic algorithm enhances AI safety by aggregating multiple models, leveraging their output probabilities for consensus sampling to minimize undetectable risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address undetectable risks in AI that cannot be mitigated through individual model inspection, providing a safety-enhancing mechanism independent of specific model architectures.

Method: The paper introduces a consensus sampling algorithm where $k$ models generate outputs, and safety is determined through agreement among the models. The safest subset's average risk is used as a benchmark, and the algorithm abstains from decisions when agreement is inadequate.

Result: The proposed method ensures safety comparable to the safest subset of models within a collection while abstaining in cases of insufficient agreement. Probabilities of abstention are theoretically bounded, provided enough models are safe and agree.

Conclusion: A novel model-agnostic AI safety approach enables amplifying safety guarantees from a subset of safe models, although it has limitations such as no protection if all models are unsafe and potential risk accumulation over time.

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

A practical robot assistant example is used to demonstrate these concepts.

Result: The presented model shifts the paradigm of intelligence from data calculation to physical, embodied interaction, highlighting the integration of the six principles into a functioning system.

Conclusion: Physical AI redefines intelligence as an emergent property of dynamic interactions between environment, body, and experience, providing a systemic approach to designing adaptive systems.

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

### [30] [Robust and Diverse Multi-Agent Learning via Rational Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09535)
*Niklas Lauffer,Ameesh Shah,Micah Carroll,Sanjit A. Seshia,Stuart Russell,Michael Dennis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adversarial optimization faces issues in cooperative settings, leading to irrational self-sabotage. The authors propose Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO) and Rational Policy Gradient (RPG) to avoid this failure mode, improving robustness and diversity in policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in using adversarial optimization within cooperative settings, specifically addressing the challenge of agents self-sabotaging due to naive implementations.

Method: The authors introduce RPO as a formalism to ensure rational behavior in adversarial settings by optimizing agents' policies within a rational framework. RPG is developed as a technique to train agents effectively by modifying the game dynamics and opponent shaping.

Result: Empirical validation demonstrates that the approach achieves robust and diverse policies across multiple cooperative and general-sum environments.

Conclusion: RPG successfully extends adversarial optimization algorithms to cooperative settings, solving self-sabotage issues and expanding their applicability to robust and diverse policy learning.

Abstract: Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents' policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

*Daniel Platnick,Dawson Tomasz,Eamon Earl,Sourena Khanzadeh,Richard Valenzano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines and compares strategies to improve greedy search methods in heuristic local minima and plateaus by using breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the effectiveness of greedy search methods like GBFS and EHC in escaping uninformed heuristic regions, which commonly cause problems such as stagnation in heuristic search.

Method: Theoretical derivations of expected runtime for escaping UHRs with BrFS and RRWs, alongside empirical benchmark testing of these methods in enhanced algorithms like EHC-RRW on PDDL planning tasks.

Result: EHC-RRW demonstrates strong runtime guarantees and performs effectively in scenarios where standard EHC struggles, as evidenced by theoretical analysis and experimental results.

Conclusion: Using restarting random walks (RRWs) in greedy search methods can significantly outperform traditional breadth-first approaches in escaping heuristic local minima and plateaus, enhancing search performance.

Abstract: Greedy search methods like Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Enforced Hill-Climbing (EHC) often struggle when faced with Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs) like heuristic local minima or plateaus. In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs.

Conclusion: The proposed platform significantly improves fault simulation efficiency, provides substantial datasets for benchmarking, and is available open-source to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Simulation-based fault injection is a widely adopted methodology for assessing circuit vulnerability to Single Event Upsets (SEUs); however, its computational cost grows significantly with circuit complexity. To address this limitation, this work introduces an open-source platform that exploits Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to accelerate SEU fault simulation. The platform includes three STGNN architectures incorporating advanced components such as Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and attention mechanisms, thereby improving spatio-temporal feature extraction. In addition, SEU fault simulation datasets are constructed from six open-source circuits with varying levels of complexity, providing a comprehensive benchmark for performance evaluation. The predictive capability of the STGNN models is analyzed and compared on these datasets. Moreover, to further investigate the efficiency of the approach, we evaluate the predictive capability of STGNNs across multiple test cases and discuss their generalization capability.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge analysts face by ensuring information sources are properly attributed during reporting.

Method: The study proposes using hybrid summarization (automatic paraphrasing of extractive summaries) and a custom topology to analyze attribution errors.

Result: The research provides methods to link summary sentences to source information while identifying attribution-related errors.

Conclusion: Ensuring attribution through hybrid summarization and error identification improves reliability in extracting relevant and traceable information.

Abstract: Analysts require attribution, as nothing can be reported without knowing the source of the information. In this paper, we will focus on automatic methods for attribution, linking each sentence in the summary to a portion of the source text, which may be in one or more documents. We explore using a hybrid summarization, i.e., an automatic paraphrase of an extractive summary, to ease attribution. We also use a custom topology to identify the proportion of different categories of attribution-related errors.

### [35] [GMTRouter: Personalized LLM Router over Multi-turn User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08590)
*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMTRouter, a method for personalized LLM routing using a graph-based learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current LLM routing methods in personalizing responses, especially when user preference data is scarce, noisy, or inconsistent.

Method: GMTRouter presents multi-turn interactions as a heterogeneous graph with nodes for users, LLMs, queries, and responses, and employs a tailored message-passing mechanism to learn user preferences from limited data.

Result: Experiments show that GMTRouter consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 21.6% higher accuracy and 0.309 higher AUC, while also adapting to new users and changing preferences with minimal data.

Conclusion: GMTRouter effectively balances personalization and computational efficiency in LLM routing by leveraging a graph-based approach, thereby addressing the challenges of user diversity and limited data.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

*Azza Bouleimen,Giordano De Marzo,Taehee Kim,Nicol`o Pagan,Hannah Metzler,Silvia Giordano,David Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate realistic online conversations, as shown in a study where LLM-generated social media content frequently deceived humans into believing it was authentic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media for applications like testing algorithms and content policies.

Method: Authentic conversations from Reddit were compared with artificial conversations created by two LLMs (Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o) via human perception tests.

Result: Participants mistook LLM-generated content as human 39% of the time, and for Llama 3, they only correctly identified AI content 56% of the time (close to random guessing).

Conclusion: LLMs have the capability to generate highly realistic social media content, offering opportunities for simulation but raising concerns about misuse in creating inauthentic online conversations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

### [37] [Knowledge Graph Analysis of Legal Understanding and Violations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08593)
*Abha Jha,Abel Salinas,Fred Morstatter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses methodologies to enhance legal analysis and safety mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive areas, focusing on Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code about biological weapons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing applications of LLMs in analyzing legal frameworks, the paper is motivated by the dual challenge of utilizing their transformative potential while addressing vulnerabilities that could unintentionally lead to misuse.

Method: The authors propose integrating knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs’ interpretation of legal frameworks, mens rea (legal intent), and potential for unsafe outputs.

Result: The study identifies limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, highlights their vulnerabilities, and demonstrates how structured evaluation can improve understanding of legal violations and intent.

Conclusion: Enhanced safety protocols and robust legal reasoning frameworks are essential for developing LLMs that ethically assist in sensitive legal domains, ensuring they contribute to legal compliance rather than violation.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

### [38] [Diverse Preference Learning for Capabilities and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08594)
*Stewart Slocum,Asher Parker-Sartori,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights how LLM alignment algorithms reduce output diversity and proposes 'Soft Preference Learning' as a solution for improving semantic, lexical, and perspective diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is derived from the growing societal impact of LLMs and the need for these models to provide diverse outputs that reflect a range of societal perspectives. Current alignment techniques like RLHF and DPO reduce diversity, creating uniform responses.

Method: The authors identify the KL divergence regularizer as the cause of reduced diversity and propose 'Soft Preference Learning,' which decouples entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty for better diversity control.

Result: Using 'Soft Preference Learning,' LLMs not only achieve higher accuracy in complex tasks but also exhibit greater semantic and lexical diversity while better reflecting diverse societal viewpoints.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves LLM alignment and capability by delivering Pareto improvements over traditional methods like temperature scaling, thus enhancing diversity and calibration.

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-of-Thought reasoning enhances problem-solving in LLMs but is computationally demanding due to redundant reasoning paths.

Method: SSDP uses semantic similarity-based dynamic pruning to cluster and remove redundant steps in real-time during tree searches.

Result: SSDP speeds up tree-search methods by up to 2.3x while maintaining competitive accuracy and reducing explored nodes by 85-90%.

Conclusion: SSDP offers a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing LLM reasoning, preserving accuracy, and lowering computational costs.

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.

TL;DR: This paper addresses hallucinations in LLMs by introducing a stress-testing framework to assess factual fidelity, revealing varying resilience levels among prominent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs threaten their reliability in high-stakes domains, necessitating solutions to ensure factual accuracy.

Method: The framework involves instructing LLMs to generate, verify, and test their robustness against adversarial lies consistent with closed domains.

Result: Five LLMs evaluated showed a spectrum of resilience to adversarial nudges: Claude (strong resilience), GPT and Grok (moderate resilience), Gemini and DeepSeek (weak resilience).

Conclusion: The varying robustness among LLMs highlights a critical need to address factual fidelity to prevent misinformation, especially as dependence on LLMs for information grows.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

*Heehwan Kim,Sungjune Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the "Self-HarmLLM" scenario, where a model's own output becomes a potential attack vector, revealing vulnerabilities in existing safeguards for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-explored vulnerability of LLMs generating harmful queries indirectly through their own outputs, which current defenses fail to adequately mitigate.

Method: The study introduces the concept of Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ), generated by the model itself, and tests if such inputs can bypass guardrails by re-entering them into the same model in various experimental conditions—Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot.

Result: The experiments revealed significant vulnerabilities: up to 65% MHQ transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in Few-shot conditions, alongside identification of inaccuracies in automated evaluation systems.

Conclusion: Current LLM guardrail designs are insufficient to fully address such self-generated attack scenarios. The study emphasizes the importance of incorporating robust evaluation methodologies and rethinking safety protocols in LLM development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Static knowledge benchmarks for LLMs are insufficient to evaluate evolving knowledge. OKBench provides automated dynamic benchmark generation focusing on daily updates from the news domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static benchmarks fail to assess large language models in a dynamic world where knowledge changes frequently. There is a need for a system that adapts to these changes.

Method: OKBench—a fully automated framework—is proposed to dynamically generate, validate, and manage high-quality knowledge benchmarks based on frequently updated sources, specifically news.

Result: Evaluated on diverse LLMs, OKBench demonstrates unique model behaviors with evolving knowledge and shows how retrieval augments performance for smaller LLMs to narrow the performance gap.

Conclusion: Dynamic benchmarks like OKBench are essential for assessing LLM capabilities in processing and adapting to evolving knowledge, promoting fair and updated evaluation systems.

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study develops a system using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with knowledge bases to produce pediatric SLP case materials, showing feasibility and quality potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating clinical vignettes for speech-language pathology is time-consuming, and existing large language models lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to errors and heavy expert editing.

Method: A prototype system using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combined with curated knowledge bases and engineered prompts was tested on commercial and open-source language models, evaluated using a quality-assessment rubric.

Result: The RAG system successfully generated SLP cases with good quality. Commercial models performed marginally better, but open-source models also produced acceptable results, enabling privacy-focused usage.

Conclusion: The RAG system is a technically feasible approach for educational material generation, though extensive validation is necessary before practical deployment. Future applications may extend beyond educational settings to clinical decision-making tools.

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

*Nazmoon Falgunee Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses extending the DisCoCirc framework for English to Bengali for translation tasks, uncovering limitations despite its utility for certain aspects of language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to test the DisCoCirc framework's effectiveness in reducing linguistic challenges and to expand its application from English to Bengali.

Method: The authors extend the DisCoCirc formalism to Bengali and analyze its performance in English-Bengali translation tasks, particularly focusing on structural differences between the languages.

Result: The research identifies limitations in the DisCoCirc framework for handling structural variations between English and Bengali, especially with simple sentences.

Conclusion: While the DisCoCirc framework shows utility, it faces notable constraints in translation tasks, emphasizing the need for further research and optimization.

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Conclusion: Mina offers a practical solution to scale access to justice in low-resource settings, highlighting key strategies for effective multilingual and domain-specific AI deployment.

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

TL;DR: This paper studies the diagnostic performance of various Large Language Models (LLMs) in emergency medicine, developing a meta-learning-based system (MEDAS) to improve diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency physicians require tools to quickly assess and diagnose patients' conditions with accuracy. AI, especially LLMs, has demonstrated potential in medical decision-support systems.

Method: The study evaluates five prominent LLMs' diagnostic accuracy in acute diseases under emergency settings. A super-learner MEDAS integrates these models using a meta-learning technique.

Result: Individual LLMs displayed diagnostic accuracy between 58% and 65%, surpassing human doctors. The super-learner achieved 70% accuracy, with one LLM reaching 85% correct diagnoses.

Conclusion: By leveraging the collective capabilities of multiple LLMs through a meta-learning approach, MEDAS enhances diagnostic performance, outperforming individual models and offering improved decision-support in emergencies.

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes GrADS, a method for efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains by selecting optimal subsets of training data, improving performance while minimizing resources and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in supervised fine-tuning of LLMs for specialization, such as resource intensiveness and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection (GrADS), relying on gradients from preliminary training to prioritize optimal training examples.

Result: Using only selected subsets (e.g., 5%-50%), LLMs achieve better domain-specific performance and mitigate catastrophic forgetting compared to fine-tuning on the entire dataset.

Conclusion: GrADS offers a cost-effective, efficient approach for domain specialization in LLMs with reduced forgetting and improved specialized task performance.

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid CNN-BiGRU deep learning framework enhanced with attention mechanisms and SHAP interpretability to detect suicidal ideation from social media data, achieving 93.97% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents, and detecting early signs from social media signals could prevent future incidents.

Method: The approach combines CNN for local features, BiGRU for sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP explainability, trained on a publicly available dataset with evaluations against state-of-the-art machine learning models.

Result: The model achieved 93.97% accuracy, outperforming existing techniques for detecting suicidal ideation across several performance metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid model successfully identifies suicidal ideation accurately and reliably, showcasing its utility and superiority for suicide detection in social network datasets.

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

*Manan Suri,Puneet Mathur,Nedim Lipka,Franck Dernoncourt,Ryan A. Rossi,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE-Agent, using structured uncertainty for better tool-call handling in LLM agents. It achieves increased task success and fewer clarification questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguous instructions often cause errors in tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs). The study aims to mitigate these issues by improving how clarification is handled, ensuring better task outcomes.

Method: A structured uncertainty approach is proposed, modeling the clarification process with a POMDP framework. SAGE-Agent uses Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) and aspect-cost modeling to prioritize and minimize redundant clarifications.

Result: SAGE-Agent improves ambiguous task coverage by 7-39% and reduces clarification questions by 1.5-2.7 times compared to baselines. Additional benchmarks like ClarifyBench validate these improvements. It also boosts reinforcement learning accuracy for tool-calling decisions significantly.

Conclusion: Structured uncertainty offers an effective framework to improve LLM tool-augmentation, enhancing task success rates and user interaction efficiency across different domains.

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

*Varada Khanna,Nilay Bhatt,Ikgyu Shin,Sule Tinaz,Yang Ren,Hua Xu,Vipina K. Keloth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates the use of NLP models to analyze cognitive processes in Parkinson's disease patient narratives, focusing on automated extraction of predefined cognitive categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how individuals with Parkinson's disease narrate cognitive experiences and how NLP can assist in analyzing these complex narratives.

Method: Researchers developed and tested three NLP models: Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization, fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct using QLoRA, and GPT-4o mini, to identify seven cognitive categories in patient narratives.

Result: Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct demonstrated the best F1-scores, especially in abstract, context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction, surpassing the other two models.

Conclusion: Although current NLP models struggle with overlapping cognitive constructs, refining these technologies could support low-effort, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive functions in Parkinson’s patients, complementing formal assessments.

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BNLI, a refined Bengali Natural Language Inference dataset addressing errors, ambiguities, and linguistic limitations in existing resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Bengali NLI datasets lack linguistic diversity and exhibit annotation inconsistencies, which hinder effective model training and evaluation.

Method: The BNLI dataset was developed through a rigorous annotation pipeline ensuring semantic clarity and equal balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. Transformer-based models were used for benchmarking.

Result: BNLI improves the reliability and interpretability of NLI models by leveraging its enriched dataset structure, demonstrating better evaluation on complex semantic relations in Bengali text.

Conclusion: BNLI serves as a robust resource for advancing Bengali-specific and low-resource natural language inference research.

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TACT, a dataset for transition-aware dialogue modeling, and proposes new metrics to evaluate conversational agents' ability to handle mode transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world conversations involve fluid transitions between task-oriented dialogue and open chitchat, but existing models struggle to handle such transitions effectively.

Method: The authors designed TACT, a dataset with integrated mode flows supporting dynamic transitions, and proposed two evaluation metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Additionally, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was applied for performance improvement.

Result: Models trained on TACT outperformed baselines in intent detection and mode transition handling, achieving high accuracy and a strong win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation.

Conclusion: The combination of structurally diverse data and DPO enhances conversational agents' response quality and transition control, promoting more advanced and proactive dialogue systems.

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioVerge, a benchmark and LLM-based framework for biomedical hypothesis generation, addressing the limitations of current methods by leveraging historical data and PubMed literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current biomedical hypothesis generation techniques, which rely on single data types and predefined extraction patterns, and to harness the potential of large language models in discovering complex connections.

Method: The authors developed BioVerge, a benchmark dataset combining historical hypotheses and PubMed data, and implemented BioVerge Agent, a framework with ReAct-based Generation and Evaluation modules for iterative hypothesis production and self-assessment.

Result: BioVerge Agent demonstrated that different architectures influence reasoning and exploration diversity, while structured and textual data contributed unique value. Self-evaluation improved the novelty and relevance of generated hypotheses significantly.

Conclusion: The integration of LLMs with structured and textual datasets, alongside self-evaluation mechanisms, provides a new pathway for advancing biomedical hypothesis generation beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: Hypothesis generation in biomedical research has traditionally centered on uncovering hidden relationships within vast scientific literature, often using methods like Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.

### [54] [Hallucinate or Memorize? The Two Sides of Probabilistic Learning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08877)
*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores the relationship between citation count and factual accuracy in bibliographic references produced by GPT-4.1, finding that highly cited papers show lower hallucination rates due to their frequency in pretraining data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of hallucinations in citation recommendations by exploring how citation frequency correlates with bibliographic accuracy in large language models.

Method: Analyzed 100 citations across twenty computer science domains generated by GPT-4.1, verified manually, and measured accuracy using cosine similarity between generated and real metadata.

Result: Higher citation counts are strongly correlated with accurate references as the model tends to memorize bibliographic information for papers cited over 1,000 times. Memory interference occurs with similar content among highly cited papers.

Conclusion: Highly cited papers are almost memorized verbatim by LLMs, while less cited ones exhibit inaccuracies. Training frequency plays a crucial role in reducing hallucination in citation generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit impressive capabilities but suffer from generating hallucinated, unreliable content.

Method: HalluClean employs a reasoning-enhanced process with planning, execution, and revision stages for unsupported claims detection and correction.

Result: HalluClean enhances factual consistency and outperforms other methods across diverse tasks according to experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise in improving LLM reliability in real-world applications by refining hallucinated content.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TiDAR, a hybrid sequence-level model combining diffusion and autoregressive methods for efficient and high-quality language generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trade-off between achieving high computation throughput and maintaining the quality typical of autoregressive language models.

Method: The authors propose TiDAR, which drafts tokens using diffusion and finalizes outputs autoregressively within a single forward pass, leveraging structured attention masks.

Result: TiDAR surpasses existing methods in throughput and quality, achieving 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second compared to autoregressive models, while also surpassing other diffusion models in efficiency and quality.

Conclusion: TiDAR balances the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive architectures, establishing a significant advancement in fast, high-quality language generation with serving-friendly properties.

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

*Longfei Zuo,Barbara Plank,Siyao Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called EVADE utilizing large language models (LLMs) for cost-efficient error detection and explanation validation in NLP datasets, particularly for tasks like natural language inference (NLI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of human label variation (HLV) in NLP datasets and reduce the cost and limitations of manual two-round annotation processes.

Method: The authors propose EVADE, a framework that uses LLMs to generate and validate explanations for error detection, cutting down on human intervention while assessing quality through various comparisons and model impacts.

Result: LLM-based validation aligns more closely with human annotations and improves model fine-tuning performance when errors detected by LLMs are removed, compared to errors identified by humans.

Conclusion: The EVADE framework effectively scales dataset error detection while reducing human effort and enhancing the overall quality and usability of NLP datasets.

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

TL;DR: Recent advances in reasoning models introduced SpiralThinker, an iterative latent reasoning framework with progressive alignment to surpass prior performance benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent reasoning methods struggle with stable latent representation evolution and systematic integration of implicit and explicit reasoning, motivating the creation of SpiralThinker.

Method: SpiralThinker employs iterative updates of latent representations without generating additional tokens, combined with a progressive alignment objective and structured annotations.

Result: SpiralThinker outperforms existing latent reasoning approaches across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, consistently surpassing benchmarks.

Conclusion: SpiralThinker demonstrates that aligned iterative updates are vital for effective latent reasoning, bridging the gap between iterative computation and reasoning in latent space.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate long-term emotional support performance of large language models (LLMs) using a trajectory-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs are inadequate as they focus on short, static dialogues and cannot assess dynamic and long-term emotional support in human-AI interactions.

Method: The authors develop a benchmark with 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies, use a first-order Markov process for emotional trajectory modeling, and implement causally-adjusted emotion estimation. They introduce three trajectory-level metrics: BEL, ETV, and ECP.

Result: Applying the framework reveals significant differences in emotional support capabilities among diverse LLMs, enabling a more nuanced and long-term performance assessment.

Conclusion: This trajectory-based, user-centered approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' emotional support capabilities, providing actionable insights for improvement in real-world applications.

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neurosymbolic framework to ensure reliable logical validation of natural language policies using large language models (LLMs), addressing their stochastic limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable the reliable adoption of LLMs in regulated industries with strict policies like healthcare and finance by mitigating stochastic limitations.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage framework: (1) LLMs formalize natural language policies with optional human guidance, and (2) inference-time autoformalization validates logical correctness, with redundant cross-checking steps for high accuracy.

Result: The benchmarks of the framework achieve over 99% soundness, almost eliminating false positive rates for identifying logical validity.

Conclusion: This approach enhances reliability in policy validation and produces auditable outcomes, aiding regulated industries while improving policy text clarity.

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MM-CRITIC, a benchmark to evaluate the critique abilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning across multiple dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration in evaluating the critique abilities of LMMs, which are growing in capability but lack sufficient tools for assessment in multimodal tasks.

Method: The authors developed MM-CRITIC, a dataset covering 8 task types and over 500 tasks, totaling 4471 samples. It includes model-generated critiques scored using expert-informed answers and guided by GPT-4 in annotations.

Result: MM-CRITIC successfully evaluates critique abilities and provides comprehensive insights into leading LMMs across multiple dimensions, such as critique quality and difficulty variance.

Conclusion: This study presents a reliable framework for assessing the critique capabilities of LMMs, paving the way for their improvement and application as multimodal AI assistants.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, addressing chunking and linguistic challenges to achieve improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance streaming speech recognition for Amdo Tibetan by resolving challenges posed by fixed-chunk methods and leveraging linguistic uniqueness.

Method: The authors use a CTC/Attention architecture with context-aware dynamic chunking and develop a Tibetan-specific lexicon for better linguistic modeling. They also employ an external language model during decoding.

Result: The framework achieved a significant performance boost with a WER of 6.23%, showing a 48.15% improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline and lower recognition latency.

Conclusion: This flexible context-aware framework offers improved speech recognition accuracy and latency for Amdo Tibetan, indicating its effectiveness and adaptability.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bi-RAR, a retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates reasoning steps bidirectionally, achieving superior performance in complex question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in handling complex multi-step reasoning tasks by addressing limitations like lack of explicit guidance for intermediate steps and reward hacking.

Method: The method involves a framework called Bi-RAR, which uses bidirectional evaluation (forward and backward) of reasoning steps, quantified by bidirectional information distance based on Kolmogorov complexity and optimized using a multi-objective reinforcement learning with cascading rewards.

Result: Bi-RAR demonstrates superior performance on seven question answering benchmarks, showing enhanced interaction and reasoning during both training and inference.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Bi-RAR improves the reasoning process in retrieval-augmented frameworks by enabling bidirectional evaluation and effective optimization, outperforming previous methods in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

*Ritsu Sakabe,Hwichan Kim,Tosho Hirasawa,Mamoru Komachi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using expanded Oogiri datasets and a six-dimensional rating system, highlighting their lack of Empathy in humor generation and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a multifaceted understanding of humor in LLMs, surpassing single-dimensional evaluations, to create advanced NLP systems like conversational agents.

Method: The authors expanded Oogiri datasets, manually annotated responses across six dimensions, and assessed LLMs' ability to generate and evaluate creative responses in Japanese improvisational comedy games.

Result: LLMs perform between low- and mid-tier human levels in humor generation, with significant deficits in Empathy, which impacts their humor assessment quality. Humans and LLMs differ significantly in prioritizing evaluation criteria.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of empathy in humor evaluation, provides insights into human-like emotional intelligence in LLMs, and releases the annotated dataset for further research on conversational agents.

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Motivation: Personalized learning enhances engagement and motivation, crucial for reading comprehension in EFL education.

Method: The study uses OpenAI's gpt-4o to transcreate content aligning with EFL students' interests. Topics are extracted from the RACE-C dataset, and passages/questions are generated while maintaining linguistic similarity and semantic relevance. Techniques such as Bloom's taxonomy-based classification and linguistic analysis are applied.

Result: In a study with EFL learners in South Korea, personalized reading materials led to higher comprehension and sustained motivation compared to standard materials.

Conclusion: Interest-aligned, AI-generated reading content positively influences EFL learners' comprehension and motivation, suggesting the potential benefits of personalized learning approaches.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DoPE is introduced to address the limitations of RoPE in Transformer models regarding length extrapolation, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability over extended contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer models face limitations in length extrapolation due to intrinsic issues in Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE).

Method: DoPE leverages truncated matrix entropy and reparameterizes noisy attention maps with a Gaussian distribution for robust extrapolation without additional training.

Result: Experiments show enhanced retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability, maintaining performance across extremely long contexts (up to 64K tokens).

Conclusion: DoPE mitigates attention sinks and improves length generalization through a denoising strategy for positional embeddings, offering a practical solution for better Transformer model performance in extended contexts.

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

*Kangning Zhang,Wenxiang Jiao,Kounianhua Du,Yuan Lu,Weiwen Liu,Weinan Zhang,Lei Zhang,Yong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoopTool is a framework that refines model training by integrating data synthesis and training in a closed-loop system, addressing inefficiencies in traditional static pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to tool learning in LLMs suffer from inefficiencies due to the static separation of data generation and model training, resulting in degraded training efficiency and persistent noisy labels.

Method: LoopTool improves tool learning for LLMs via three core modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing to diagnose model weaknesses, (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification to correct annotation errors, and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion to generate new challenging samples. This process iteratively refines both datasets and models in an open-source framework.

Result: With LoopTool, an 8B parameter model surpasses the performance of its 32B data generator model, setting new benchmarks on BFCL-v3 and ACEBench datasets.

Conclusion: Closed-loop, self-refining data synthesis and training pipelines significantly enhance LLMs' tool-use capabilities, offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive closed-source APIs.

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for Table Question Answering (TQA) by accurately identifying cells linked to questions without manually analyzing table headers, achieving 74.6% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Language Models fail to correctly interpret complex table structures in TQA tasks, necessitating a method to process tables effectively.

Method: The approach uses a hybrid retrieval mechanism combining language models and TF-IDF to estimate table headers and employs contrastive learning to improve performance on limited data.

Result: The proposed method achieves 74.6% accuracy on the NTCIR-18 dataset, surpassing existing LLMs like GPT-4o mini (63.9%).

Conclusion: The method enhances TQA by effectively processing tables, though future improvements will integrate advanced retrieval models to narrow gaps with human evaluations.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and validates a contextual version of sequentiality for automated essay scoring and related tasks, showing its improved alignment with human-annotated traits like Organization and Cohesion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations and critiques of previous sequentiality measures, including confounded results and lack of validation against ground-truth measures.

Method: Empirical testing of contextual sequentiality on two essay datasets (ASAP++ and ELLIPSE) with human-annotated scores, and comparisons with other sequentiality formulations and zero-shot LLM predictions.

Result: The contextual sequentiality measure aligns better with human discourse-level traits, adds predictive value when combined with standard linguistic features, and outperforms zero-shot LLMs in such combinations.

Conclusion: Context-based sequentiality is validated as a useful, interpretable, and complementary feature for applications like automatic essay scoring.

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

TL;DR: The paper studies how subword tokenization, when dynamically optimized during training, evolves during pretraining and finetuning for typologically diverse languages, showing stages of learning and benefits for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the dynamic evolution of subword tokenization during language model training and its impact on text generation and cross-lingual transfer, especially for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

Method: The authors extend the Subword Segmental Language Model (SSLM) to support pretraining and finetuning, and analyze language models trained on isi-Xhosa, Setswana, and English to track subword dynamics using linguistic factors like morphology, productivity, and fertility.

Result: Four stages of subword learning were identified, with greater instability in morphologically complex languages like isi-Xhosa. Subword boundaries become finer-grained during finetuning, improving text generation and cross-lingual transfer.

Conclusion: Learning subwords dynamically during model training can optimize linguistic insights and enhance language processing capabilities for complex and low-resource languages.

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

*Jiarui Liu,Kaustubh Dhole,Yingheng Wang,Haoyang Wen,Sarah Zhang,Haitao Mao,Gaotang Li,Neeraj Varshney,Jingguo Liu,Xiaoman Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in aligning language models with deductive reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning, proposing a novel method called Anchor to stabilize training and improve reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the issue of reinforcement learning models collapsing during training when negative rewards dominate, particularly in honesty alignment tasks where models need to differentiate between valid conclusions and unanswerable queries.

Method: The authors curated two deductive reasoning datasets and proposed 'Anchor,' a reinforcement learning method that incorporates ground truth trajectories into training to prevent collapse.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that traditional methods like GRPO struggle with reasoning tasks, but the proposed Anchor method stabilized learning and boosted reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Anchor proved effective in improving deductive reasoning in language models by addressing training dynamic challenges, highlighting the need for proper training strategies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces POTSA, a new framework using Optimal Transport to improve multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT), particularly bridging gaps between high- and low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address biased performance in S2TT caused by neglecting semantic commonalities across source languages, especially for low-resource scenarios.

Method: The authors propose POTSA, which includes a Bias Compensation module for coarse alignment, token-level OT constraints using Q-Former for fine-grained alignment, and layer scheduling to focus on semantically impactful layers. The approach leverages cross-lingual parallel speech pairs.

Result: Experiments on the FLEURS dataset demonstrated SOTA performance, with significant BLEU score improvements for both commonly used and zero-shot languages, using minimal data.

Conclusion: POTSA effectively bridges translation gaps in S2TT while needing only 10 hours of parallel speech, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness for both high- and low-resource languages.

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

*Yu Li,Zhe Yang,Yi Huang,Xin Liu,Guilin Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces C$^3$TG, a framework enabling precise multi-attribute control in text generated by LLMs without requiring architectural changes or extensive fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for text attribute control in LLMs are limited to basic, single-attribute settings and fail to manage conflicts or incorporate iterative optimization for multi-attribute control.

Method: The proposed C$^3$TG framework uses a two-phase approach by pairing LLMs with attribute classifiers to control token probabilities and resolving conflicts through iterative optimization with an energy function.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that C$^3$TG improves attribute accuracy, fluency, and output diversity while reducing toxicity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: C$^3$TG is a cost-effective and flexible solution for fine-grained, multi-attribute text generation control, achieving superior performance without requiring extensive model modifications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

*John Joon Young Chung,Vishakh Padmakumar,Melissa Roemmele,Yi Wang,Yuqian Sun,Tiffany Wang,Shm Garanganao Almeda,Brett A. Halperin,Yuwen Lu,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'LiteraryTaste,' a dataset for exploring individual creative writing preferences, and evaluates the performance of personalized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for personalized adaptation in large language models (LLMs) for creative writing tasks, as current datasets fail to reflect the nuanced differences in personal tastes.

Method: The researchers compiled a dataset, LiteraryTaste, with data from 60 people who reported their reading habits/tastes and annotated preferences over 100 writing samples. They also applied LLM-driven interpretability techniques and fine-tuned transformer encoder models to test revealed preferences.

Result: The study found that individuals exhibit diverse writing preferences, and fine-tuned models achieved 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy in modeling personal and collective revealed preferences respectively, with limited utility of stated preferences.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential for improving creative writing LLMs by considering individualized preferences and provides a dataset to further this goal.

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

*Marry Kong,Rina Buoy,Sovisal Chenda,Nguonly Taing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an explainable Khmer polarity classification model using a fine-tuned Qwen-3, enabling prediction with self-explanations and presenting a newly constructed Khmer polarity dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance Khmer polarity classification by integrating explainability, as existing models lack rationale transparency in predictions.

Method: The authors fine-tuned an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model for Khmer polarity classification, incorporating self-explanations linked to keywords or phrases for improved rationalization.

Result: The fine-tuned model successfully provides accurate classifications and reasoning support, and the study released a Khmer polarity dataset built with heuristic rules and human curation.

Conclusion: This work improves explainability in Khmer NLP tasks by providing a model capable of explicit rationalization and a novel dataset for future research.

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

*Zhuoqun Huang,Neil G. Marchant,Olga Ohrimenko,Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses improving robustness for sequence classification under edit distance perturbations, using adaptable deletion rates tailored to input characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robustness methods for sequence classification rely on fixed-rate deletion mechanisms, which can be inefficient for inputs of varying lengths, such as natural language sentences.

Method: The authors propose AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates, incorporated with an extended randomized smoothing framework, ensuring sound certifications against edit distance perturbations.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in natural language tasks, including up to 30 orders of magnitude increment in median certified region cardinality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: AdaptDel methods enhance certified robustness for sequence classification tasks, offering more dynamic and effective solutions tailored to varying input properties.

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces mmJEE-Eval, a challenging multimodal bilingual benchmark derived from JEE Advanced exam questions, revealing gaps in reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To distinguish true scientific reasoning capabilities of vision-language models from mere pattern matching, which current benchmarks fail to assess effectively.

Method: Developed a new multimodal bilingual benchmark (mmJEE-Eval) based on JEE Advanced examination questions in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, and evaluated state-of-the-art models against this benchmark.

Result: State-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) performed variably, from 77-84% accuracy; open-source models achieved 37-45%. Current benchmarks don’t reveal these disparities as clearly, while mmJEE-Eval stresses reasoning over memorization.

Conclusion: The new benchmark clearly identifies limitations in models' reasoning abilities, enabling effective comparison of training and reasoning approaches. The authors publicly release the data and code for further research.

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

*Shiyu Ji,Yixuan Wang,Yijun Liu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeerSC improves inference efficiency in LLMs by reducing token usage and latency without sacrificing performance, utilizing dynamic self-consistency with System 1 and System 2 reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods improve LLMs' inference performance but are computationally expensive. Reducing token consumption and latency is necessary for efficient scaling.

Method: SeerSC uses System 1 for rapid entropy calculation and System 2 for dynamic self-consistency with parallel generation, optimizing token efficiency and reducing latency.

Result: The method achieves up to 47% reduction in token consumption and 43% reduction in inference latency compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: SeerSC offers a practical and efficient framework for improving LLM inference, addressing computational cost challenges while maintaining accuracy and performance.

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

*Martin Vejvar,Yasutaka Fujimoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool are introduced for translating SPARQL queries to Cypher, demonstrating high parsing accuracy and execution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of efficient and accurate tools for translating SPARQL queries to Cypher prompted the development of Spider4SSC and S2CLite.

Method: S2CLite is a rule-based, ontology-agnostic parser inspired by traditional programming language compilers, aiming for error reduction without dependency on RDF graphs or external tools.

Result: Experiments show 77.8% parsing accuracy and 96.6% execution accuracy for S2CLite, outperforming state-of-the-art tools in error reduction and query executions.

Conclusion: S2CLite and Spider4SSC contribute significantly to the SPARQL-to-Cypher translation field by providing efficient, open-source solutions and a rich dataset for further research.

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTQ-Eval, a framework for multilingual text quality evaluation, improving large language models' capability in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in general text quality assessment, especially for multilingual contexts, using large language models.

Method: MTQ-Eval is trained on automatically generated text quality preference data using open-source base LLMs to distinguish between high- and low-quality texts.

Result: MTQ-Eval demonstrates improved multilingual text quality evaluation across 115 languages, and its enhancements positively impact downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The novel framework effectively enhances multilingual text evaluation and promotes advances in related applications and tasks.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

*Hossein A. Rahmani,Satyapriya Krishna,Xi Wang,Mohammadmehdi Naghiaei,Emine Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the differences in self-correction mechanisms of large language models when tasked with open-ended generation versus multiple-choice selection across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how self-correction dynamics differ between open-ended generation and multiple-choice selection tasks in large language models, and the implications for reasoning and decision-making capabilities.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic investigation comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors using language models of different sizes and families across diversified natural language tasks.

Result: The study revealed that open-ended generation leverages flexibility and compositional refinement, while multiple-choice selection benefits from clear solution boundaries but is limited by predefined options. Each approach displayed distinct improvement patterns and failure modes.

Conclusion: Effective self-correction mechanisms need to accommodate the interplay between task structure and output space, which is crucial for improving knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-making applications in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

### [83] [AMaPO: Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization for Language Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09385)
*Ruibo Deng,Duanyu Feng,Wenqiang Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving offline preference optimization, highlighting the limitations due to the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma. A new algorithm, AMaPO, is proposed to address these challenges, enhancing ranking accuracy and alignment in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline preference optimization methods struggle with ranking accuracy due to issues like overfitting and underfitting. Addressing these challenges is critical for improving alignment in language models.

Method: The authors propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), which uses an adaptive margin refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling to balance gradients for misranked and correctly ranked samples.

Result: Experiments show that AMaPO improves ranking accuracy and downstream alignment. It is also shown to effectively address the overfitting-underfitting dilemma, as evidenced by targeted analysis.

Conclusion: AMaPO enhances offline preference optimization by reallocating learning effort to better handle misranked and correct samples, confirming its robustness and alignment effectiveness.

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

*Lukas Arana,Julen Etxaniz,Ander Salaberria,Gorka Azkune*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a strong Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for Basque, a low-resource language, by creating specific image-text datasets and experimenting with training data mixtures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in performance of open Multimodal LLMs in low-resource languages compared to commercial models.

Method: The study creates image-text datasets and uses two types of backbone LLMs (Llama-3.1-Instruct and Latxa). It explores variations in Basque multimodal data ratios for training.

Result: The findings show that only 20% Basque data is sufficient for good results, and a Basque-instructed LLM is not essential for developing a high-performance Basque MLLM.

Conclusion: The work provides resources for advancing MLLM development in low-resource languages and demonstrates the broader application of its insights to other languages.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CARE-Bench, an automated benchmark to assess the counseling competence of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing existing evaluation limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mismatch between growing demand for psychological counseling and limited availability of services prompted the exploration of LLMs in counseling.

Method: CARE-Bench utilizes diverse real-world client profiles, expert-guided simulations, and multidimensional performance evaluations based on psychological scales.

Result: CARE-Bench reveals limitations of general-purpose and specialized counseling LLMs and provides key insights into their failures.

Conclusion: The study provides a systematic framework and recommendations to advance LLMs for more effective and universal psychological counseling models.

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GSAP-ERE, a curated dataset for fine-grained information extraction in machine learning research, demonstrating its utility in various tasks and highlighting its superiority over unsupervised large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid evolution of machine learning and AI research, there's a growing need to extract and organize fine-grained information from scientific publications to enhance understanding and reproducibility.

Method: The authors curated a dataset, GSAP-ERE, containing 63K entities and 35K relations from ML publications' full texts, with annotation for 10 entity types and 18 relation types. They tested fine-tuned models and prompting strategies of LLMs for extracting and connecting this data.

Result: Fine-tuned models achieved significantly better performance (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0%) compared to LLM prompting methods (NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1%), demonstrating effective information extraction capabilities.

Conclusion: The disparity highlights that datasets like GSAP-ERE are essential for advancing supervised and fine-tuned approaches in scholarly information extraction, which outperform unsupervised usage of LLMs.

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of predicting individual personalities from large text volumes, especially in the context of limitations faced by large language models with extensive inputs.

Method: The paper proposes the BIG5-TPoT model, where the Targeted Preselection of Texts (TPoT) strategy semantically filters input texts to ensure relevance to a specific personality trait, facet, or item for deep learning predictions.

Result: The method improves prediction accuracy and decreases the Mean Absolute Error on the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

Conclusion: Targeted semantic filtering enhances model performance and addresses large language model limitations in personality prediction tasks by focusing on relevant input texts.

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

TL;DR: The paper examines readability measures in automatic text simplification (ATS), finding weak correlations with human judgments and ATS metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve text accessibility for diverse audiences and investigate the adequacy of existing readability measures within ATS.

Method: Investigates correlations between readability measures, human judgments, and ATS evaluation metrics in English texts.

Result: Readability measures generally show poor correlation with both automatic metrics and human judgment, indicating misalignment.

Conclusion: A clearer definition of simplification criteria in ATS is needed to address low correlations among readability measures, human judgment, and evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Readability is a key concept in the current era of abundant written information. To help making texts more readable and make information more accessible to everyone, a line of researched aims at making texts accessible for their target audience: automatic text simplification (ATS). Lately, there have been studies on the correlations between automatic evaluation metrics in ATS and human judgment. However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment. We argue that as the three different angles from which simplification can be assessed tend to exhibit rather low correlations with one another, there is a need for a clear definition of the construct in ATS.

TL;DR: Synthetic data is evaluated for its effectiveness in long-context claim verification using a new framework, SynClaimEval, emphasizing its use for hallucination detection and fact-checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longer context windows in LLMs help reason over extensive documents directly, but annotated resources are costly; hence, synthetic data is explored as a scalable alternative.

Method: SynClaimEval assesses synthetic data for claim verification across dimensions like input characteristics, synthesis logic, and explanation quality.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved verification and explanation quality through synthetic data, especially when combined with human-written datasets.

Conclusion: Using synthetic data can enhance both long-context task performance and model explainability efficiently.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context windows promise direct reasoning over long documents, reducing the need for chunking or retrieval. Constructing annotated resources for training and evaluation, however, remains costly. Synthetic data offers a scalable alternative, and we introduce SynClaimEval, a framework for evaluating synthetic data utility in long-context claim verification -- a task central to hallucination detection and fact-checking. Our framework examines three dimensions: (i) input characteristics, by varying context length and testing generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks; (ii) synthesis logic, by controlling claim complexity and error type variation; and (iii) explanation quality, measuring the degree to which model explanations provide evidence consistent with predictions. Experiments across benchmarks show that long-context synthesis can improve verification in base instruction-tuned models, particularly when augmenting existing human-written datasets. Moreover, synthesis enhances explanation quality, even when verification scores do not improve, underscoring its potential to strengthen both performance and explainability.

Conclusion: The proposed AI-based solution effectively automates the digitization process of gas plant structures, addressing challenges of data variety and lack of standardization with promising accuracy levels.

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

### [91] [Token Is All You Need: Cognitive Planning through Belief-Intent Co-Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05540)
*Shiyao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper challenges the need for exhaustive scene modeling in autonomous driving and introduces a tokenized approach of belief and intent for effective planning, validated on the nuPlan benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to question and refine the traditional assumption that high-performance autonomous driving requires reconstructing the world, exploring how a minimal yet semantically rich tokenization of belief and intent could suffice.

Method: The method involves representing planning through sparse intent tokens and conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens, focusing on belief-intent co-evolution and eliminating exhaustive scene reconstruction.

Result: The study achieves key results showing competitive performance with sparse intent tokens (0.487 m ADE) and improved accuracy with predicted future tokens (0.382 m ADE), highlighting the effectiveness of task-driven co-evolution in planning.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that intelligence in planning emerges from the duality of belief and intent rather than pixel fidelity. This tokenized approach offers robustness under uncertainty and supports foresightful planning through imagination.

Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Inspired by cognitive science, we propose that effective planning arises not from reconstructing the world, but from the co-evolution of belief and intent within a minimal set of semantically rich tokens. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, 11k+ samples) reveal three principles: (1) sparse intent tokens alone achieve 0.487 m ADE, demonstrating strong performance without future prediction; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.382 m, a 21.6% improvement, showing that performance emerges from cognitive planning; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss degrades performance, confirming that task-driven belief-intent co-evolution suffices under reliable perception inputs. Crucially, we observe the emergence of cognitive consistency: through prolonged training, the model spontaneously develops stable token dynamics that balance current perception (belief) and future goals (intent). This process, accompanied by "temporal fuzziness," enables robustness under uncertainty and continuous self-optimization. Our work establishes a new paradigm: intelligence lies not in pixel fidelity, but in the tokenized duality of belief and intent. By reframing planning as understanding rather than reaction, TIWM bridges the gap between world models and VLA systems, paving the way for foresightful agents that plan through imagination. Note: Numerical comparisons with methods reporting results on nuScenes are indicative only, as nuPlan presents a more challenging planning-focused evaluation.

### [92] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses lip leakage in inpainting-based talking face generation and introduces a methodology for its evaluation with derived metrics and test setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inpainting-based talking face generation often causes lip leakage, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than audio, affecting the video's realism and speaker consistency.

Method: The proposed methodology includes three test setups (silent-input, mismatched audio-video pairing, matched audio-video synthesis) and derived metrics to quantify lip leakage.

Result: The framework systematically evaluates lip leakage, studies identity reference selections, and provides insights for improving talking face generation models.

Conclusion: The introduced methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a reliable benchmark for future research, addressing key challenges in evaluating lip leakage in talking face generation.

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

*Kosta Dakic,Kanchana Thilakarathna,Rodrigo N. Calheiros,Teng Joon Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MATRIX, a dataset for dynamic multi-drone surveillance featuring challenging environments, and a novel deep learning framework that addresses detection and tracking in such scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pedestrian tracking methods struggle with dynamic camera positions and occlusions in multi-drone systems.

Method: The study introduces a dataset with 8 drones and a deep learning framework using real-time camera calibration, image registration, and multi-view BEV feature fusion.

Result: The proposed system achieves ∼90% detection and tracking accuracy and successfully tracks ∼80% of trajectories in complex scenarios. It gracefully handles camera dropouts and shows strong transfer learning performance.

Conclusion: MATRIX significantly advances dynamic multi-view surveillance capabilities while providing benchmarks for further research in challenging environments.

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

*Xuan Yu,Tianyang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a topology-driven framework for dynamic multi-subspace fusion on Grassmannian manifolds, enabling adaptive collaboration and achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches largely use static single-subspace representations, which fail to capture the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for complex geometric structures.

Method: The framework includes adaptive multi-subspace modelling based on topological convergence analysis and multi-subspace interaction through Fréchet mean optimisation. Theoretical convergence guarantees under projection metric topology and practical enhancements like Riemannian batch normalization and mutual information regularization are integrated.

Result: Experiments on 3D action recognition, EEG classification, and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The work contributes to geometric deep learning by bridging multi-channel interaction from Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, resulting in improved discriminability and interpretability.

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

*Assaf Singer,Noam Rotstein,Amir Mann,Ron Kimmel,Or Litany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free framework for precise motion and appearance control in video generation using diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video generation struggle with precise motion control and require computationally expensive tuning. There’s a need for a more accessible and efficient motion-conditioned synthesis approach.

Method: The framework uses crude reference animations for coarse motion cues and incorporates dual-clock denoising to manage regional motion control. This method modifies the sampling process without additional training costs.

Result: TTM demonstrates superior realism and motion control compared to training-based methods and introduces pixel-level appearance control surpassing text-based prompting capabilities.

Conclusion: TTM is efficient, training-free, and compatible with any backbone, while offering advanced motion and appearance control in video generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Continual Anomaly Detection framework using a unified memory bank, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy without task-specific memory fragmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable and flexible CAD framework that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and eliminates task-specific memory restrictions.

Method: Introduce a unified memory bank updated incrementally during training, leveraging nearest-neighbor matching for anomaly detection during inference.

Result: The framework achieves high average AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa), and 100% accuracy on a real-world dataset.

Conclusion: Unified memory bank-based CAD improves anomaly detection, demonstrating robust performance and scalability.

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

*Xingcheng Liu,Bin Rao,Yanchen Guan,Chengyue Wang,Haicheng Liao,Jiaxun Zhang,Chengyu Lin,Meixin Zhu,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for accident anticipation in autonomous driving, integrating diffusion-based denoising and time-aware actor-critic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve proactive safety in autonomous driving by addressing noisy sensors and balancing early accident alerts with suppression of false alarms.

Method: The authors use a unified approach combining noise-resilient diffusion modules for sensory data refinement with actor-critic temporal reasoning for timely and reliable accident predictions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and gains in mean time-to-accident, robust even under noisy conditions, on benchmark datasets like DAD, CCD, and A3D.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows promise for real-world autonomous driving safety applications by producing earlier, reliable, and human-aligned accident predictions across traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework to enhance dynamic scene graph generation in videos by scoring object relations using spatial and temporal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DSGG methods fail to effectively guide inference for non-related object pairs and struggle to identify meaningful relations, especially due to long-tailed distributions.

Method: RS-Net leverages a spatial context encoder and a temporal encoder to score the importance of object relations. It uses learnable context tokens and video-level aggregation to improve relation predictions by providing unified triplet scoring.

Result: RS-Net improves Recall and Precision on the Action Genome dataset across various baselines, addressing long-tailed relation distributions while maintaining high efficiency despite added complexity.

Conclusion: RS-Net offers a plug-and-play enhancement for DSGG models, significantly improving their performance without requiring architectural modifications.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) for preserving visual privacy in video foundation models, operating entirely in a latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the privacy issues in video foundation models by preventing leakage of sensitive personal information from learned spatio-temporal features.

Method: Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM), with three training objectives: clip-level self-supervised privacy, a co-training utility objective, and latent consistency loss. It is applied to frozen video encoders.

Result: AAM achieves a 35% privacy leakage reduction while maintaining almost baseline utility across multiple video analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The study confirms AAM's efficacy in balancing visual privacy and task performance, reducing gender biases, and proposing new evaluation protocols for equitable video understanding.

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

TL;DR: The paper studies autoregressive next-pixel prediction's scaling properties for unified vision models, highlighting task-dependent scaling strategies and emphasizing compute as the primary bottleneck over data size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the potential and scaling requirements of autoregressive next-pixel prediction models for tasks like classification, generation, and resolution increases.

Method: Training a family of Transformers on varying budgets of FLOPs with IsoFlops profiles, evaluating three metrics: next-pixel prediction, classification accuracy, and generation quality.

Result: Optimal scaling is task-dependent and varies across classifications and generations. Larger image resolutions require models to grow faster than datasets, with compute being the main limitation.

Conclusion: Compute advancements make pixel-by-pixel modeling feasible in under five years, emphasizing scaling strategies for vision models.

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

TL;DR: The paper addresses biases in image classification systems arising from uneven training data representation, proposing improved techniques to balance datasets using diffusion-finetuning methods to generate balanced training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image classification systems inherit biases from imbalanced training data distributions, often reinforcing stereotypes and leading to inaccurate results.

Method: The authors explore advanced diffusion-finetuning techniques, using LoRA and DreamBooth to generate balanced datasets by learning directly from samples, clustering images to manage variations within groups, and using cluster-specific DreamBooth models.

Result: Experiments show these approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion and rival or surpass state-of-the-art debiasing methods, particularly in scenarios with severe dataset bias.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques improve image classification results and debiasing effectiveness by addressing fundamental dataset bias issues, especially under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

*Abu Taib Mohammed Shahjahan,A. Ben Hamza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PoseKAN, an adaptive graph-based framework for 2D-to-3D human pose estimation, which overcomes limitations of graph convolutional networks such as local receptive fields and spectral bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCN-based methods for 3D human pose estimation struggle with capturing long-range dependencies needed for occlusions and depth ambiguities, and fail to model high-frequency details effectively.

Method: PoseKAN utilizes adaptive learnable functions on graph edges, multi-hop feature aggregation, residual blocks, and global response normalization for effective and expressive pose estimation.

Result: PoseKAN demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Adaptive graph-based learning techniques in PoseKAN improve the model's spatial awareness and expressiveness, addressing key challenges in pose estimation tasks effectively.

Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods have shown strong performance in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging the natural graph structure of the human skeleton. However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.

*Jingjie He,Weijie Liang,Zihan Shan,Matthew Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modern vision models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks caused by pixel-level perturbations. This paper introduces SIFT-Graph, a framework that combines robust visual features with deep learning models, enhancing their defense. Results show improved robustness against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deep vision models rely on dense pixel-level data, which makes them susceptible to imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Addressing this vulnerability requires robust feature incorporation beyond fragile pixel-level defenses.

Method: The authors propose SIFT-Graph, a multimodal framework combining Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) keypoints and Graph Attention Network to extract robust, rotation and scale-invariant image features. These embeddings are integrated into traditional deep models like Vision Transformers and CNNs.

Result: SIFT-Graph improves robustness against white box adversarial attacks while maintaining minimal performance drop on clean images.

Conclusion: The study provides a structure-aware defense mechanism, showing potential to strengthen deep vision models against adversarial vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks expose a fundamental vulnerability in modern deep vision models by exploiting their dependence on dense, pixel-level representations that are highly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations. Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.

*Wonbong Jang,Jonathan Tremblay,Lourdes Agapito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for novel view synthesis using a transformer-based architecture and unique training paradigms, achieving better results on unaligned real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based approaches for novel view synthesis are limited to small camera movements or object-centric scenes and struggle with generalized, real-world applications.

Method: They introduce DT-NVS, a diffusion model with a transformer-based architecture, advanced self-attention mechanisms, and novel camera conditioning strategies for training on unaligned datasets. A new training paradigm swaps the roles of key frame and noisy input.

Result: DT-NVS improves over state-of-the-art models in generating novel 3D views from single images while producing diverse and realistic outputs.

Conclusion: DT-NVS expands the capabilities of novel view synthesis, making it viable for generalized real-world scenarios from unaligned video datasets, overcoming limitations of prior models.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

### [106] [Enhancing Rotation-Invariant 3D Learning with Global Pose Awareness and Attention Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08833)
*Jiaxun Guo,Manar Amayri,Nizar Bouguila,Xin Liu,Wentao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF) to address global pose awareness in rotation-invariant learning for 3D point clouds, alongside an innovative attention-driven convolution operator and adaptive shadow localization module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rotation-invariant learning methods struggle with global pose awareness, leading to issues like indistinguishable symmetric features (e.g., airplane wings). This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The paper proposes SiPF that integrates a globally consistent reference ('shadow') and Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv) for better feature aggregation. Additionally, it introduces a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution.

Result: Experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks show improved performance in spatially fine-grained tasks under arbitrary rotations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances rotation-invariant learning by addressing global pose awareness limitations, thereby advancing tasks requiring spatial discrimination under varied rotations.

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

*Hu Cui,Wenqiang Hua,Renjing Huang,Shurui Jia,Tessai Hayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAS-SSM, an enhanced architecture for 3D human pose estimation based on State Space Models, addressing limitations of prior methods by maintaining pose structure and improving performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing SSM-based methods that disrupt the spatial structure of human poses and entangle spatial-temporal features, leading to difficulties in capturing complex pose dependencies.

Method: The proposed SAS-SSM leverages a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to model local joint interactions and a stride-based scan strategy for multi-scale global structural representations, ensuring linear computational complexity.

Result: The SAS-SSM-based SasMamba model achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

Conclusion: SAS-SSM improves 3D human pose estimation by maintaining spatial structure and achieving efficient global-local modeling, offering a parameter-efficient alternative to existing models.

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on State Space Models (SSMs) has gained attention in 3D human pose estimation due to its linear complexity and strong global modeling capability. However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

### [108] [Improve Contrastive Clustering Performance by Multiple Fusing-Augmenting ViT Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08883)
*Cheng Wang,Shuisheng Zhou,Fengjiao Peng,Jin Sheng,Feng Ye,Yinli Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MFAVBs, a novel method built upon Vision Transformers to improve image clustering performance, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in extant contrastive learning networks, particularly their insufficient utilization of complementarity and similarity in positive pairs for clustering features extraction.

Method: MFAVBs incorporate shared-weight Vision Transformers to process positive pairs, fuse their features, and progressively augment and refine features across blocks. Preprocessed augmentations with CLIP-extracted features are used for input.

Result: Experiments conducted on seven public datasets demonstrate superior clustering performance using MFAVBs compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed MFAVBs approach is effective in improving clustering tasks by leveraging advanced feature fusion and augmenting strategies in Vision Transformers, setting a new standard in clustering performance.

Abstract: In the field of image clustering, the widely used contrastive learning networks improve clustering performance by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs and the dissimilarity of negative pairs of the inputs. Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model. Our experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that MFAVBs serving as the backbone for contrastive clustering outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of clustering performance.

TL;DR: The study investigates a deep learning model to classify six histological sub-regions of Glioblastoma (GBM) using EfficientNet architectures, achieving high accuracy in training but moderate scores on validation and testing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioblastoma is a fast-growing brain tumor with a poor prognosis, and current diagnostic methods have not significantly improved patient outcomes. The paper aims to enhance morphological understanding using automated sub-region classification.

Method: A deep learning approach with EfficientNet architectures (B0-B4) is used for histopathological region classification. The model performance was evaluated with the BraTS-Path 2024 dataset, employing a 5-fold cross-validation configuration.

Result: EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the highest F1 score of 0.98 during training, while validation and testing scores were lower at 0.546 and 0.517 respectively, highlighting generalization challenges.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the difficulty of creating models that generalize well to unseen data in clinical settings, despite promising accuracy in training. Open-source code is provided for further research.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

Result: Enhanced VisNet variants show substantial improvements in recognition accuracy across datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10 compared to the baseline model.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the biological relevance and effectiveness of VisNet-inspired architecture, bridging neuroscience and AI for interpretable and robust visual recognition.

Abstract: Object recognition plays a fundamental role in how biological organisms perceive and interact with their environment. While the human visual system performs this task with remarkable efficiency, reproducing similar capabilities in artificial systems remains challenging.

By leveraging principles of Hebbian learning and temporal continuity associating temporally adjacent views to build invariant representations. VisNet and its extensions capture robust and transformation invariant features. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and custom symmetric object sets, show that these enhanced VisNet variants substantially improve recognition accuracy compared with the baseline model. These findings underscore the adaptability and biological relevance of VisNet inspired architectures, offering a powerful and interpretable framework for visual recognition in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

*Riling Wei,Kelu Yao,Chuanguang Yang,Jin Wang,Zhuoyan Gao,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD) and a SemBridge framework to improve knowledge transfer between modalities with limited semantic overlap, achieving state-of-the-art results in remote sensing scene classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation methods when working with unpaired modalities in real-world settings.

Method: Introduces SemBridge, a framework combining Student-Friendly Matching for personalized semantic instruction and Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment using Lagrangian optimization.

Result: State-of-the-art performance is achieved on 6 model architectures across various datasets, using a new benchmark dataset based on Multi-Spectral and RGB images.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates effective cross-modal knowledge transfer under weak semantic consistency, overcoming challenges of knowledge transmission costs.

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that enhances semi-supervised document layout understanding by integrating OCR-LLMs for structural priors with visual models, leading to higher performance using minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the data-intensive nature of document layout understanding and develop a semi-supervised approach that efficiently utilizes structural priors from large language models, reducing dependency on massive labeled datasets.

Method: The method integrates OCR and pretrained large language models (LLMs) with a probabilistic fusion model, refining pseudo-labels using inverse-variance weighting of visual and structural predictions.

Result: The proposed framework shows improved performance, achieving state-of-the-art results like 89.7 AP on PubLayNet with LayoutLMv3 and demonstrating the complementary role of LLMs to both lightweight and pretrained architectures.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates that structural priors from LLMs can improve semi-supervised document layout understanding while reducing costs and labeled data dependency, opening avenues for privacy-preserving and targeted solutions.

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel unsupervised method (CCDF) for remote sensing change detection, incorporating consistency modules to improve reconstruction and achieve superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior unsupervised methods for remote sensing change detection suffer from generator overfitting during style transfer and reconstruction, leading to poor performance.

Method: The proposed Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) integrates Cycle Consistency (CC) and Semantic Consistency (SC) modules to tackle overfitting and enhance reconstruction quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show that CCDF outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in detecting changes in remote sensing images.

Conclusion: CCDF effectively addresses the challenges in traditional reconstruction-based methods by improving robustness and detail, leading to superior change detection results in unsupervised settings.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: This study introduces a shape-agnostic person detection method, HitoMi-Cam, implemented on resource-limited hardware, outperforming CNNs in scenarios with unpredictable shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the shape dependency limitation of CNN-based object detection, particularly in unpredictable environments such as disaster rescue.

Method: Utilize spectral reflectance properties of clothing for person detection, implemented on edge hardware without GPU.

Result: The system achieved 23.2 fps processing speed and outperformed CNN models in a simulated search and rescue scenario with an AP of 93.5%.

Conclusion: The spectral-based approach is practical for real-time person detection on edge devices and serves as a complementary solution to CNNs in specific conditions like disaster rescue situations.

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

*Zimao Lu,Hui Xu,Bing Liu,Ke Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NES to improve zero-shot image captioning by addressing hallucination issues and enhancing cross-domain generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot image captioning suffers from hallucinated content and poor cross-domain generalization in text-only training approaches.

Method: NES incorporates three stages: synthetic images for consistent retrieval, filtering out negative entities, and attention-level suppression for minimizing hallucination.

Result: NES improves cross-domain transfer, reduces hallucination rates, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: NES effectively suppresses hallucination in zero-shot image captioning, maintaining competitive in-domain performance and demonstrating enhanced generalization.

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPEED-Q, a framework for aggressively quantizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to low bits for deployment on edge devices, achieving high accuracy and stability in resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying VLMs on edge devices is challenging due to resource constraints, and existing methods haven't focused much on aggressive quantization for billion-parameter VLMs suited for these devices. The aim is to make VLM deployment efficient in terms of memory and computation.

Method: The authors propose SPEED-Q, a staged processing framework that includes sensitivity-adaptive quantization to balance vision and language components and a distillation-enhanced strategy to stabilize training and reduce dependency on large datasets.

Result: Experiments show that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than other quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms others in both 2-bit and 4-bit settings across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPEED-Q offers a highly effective solution for aggressively quantizing billion-parameter VLMs for edge deployment, improving accuracy and stability. This makes VLMs more practical for lower latency and privacy-focused applications.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

*Zifu Zhang,Shengxi Li,Xiancheng Sun,Mai Xu,Zhengyuan Liu,Jingyuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel collaborative compression method prioritizing machine-vision compression as a base and achieves superior performance for both human and machine vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in existing collaborative compression methods built on human-vision pipelines, which lead to higher complexity and bit-rates. Machine-vision requires less information, presenting an opportunity to create a more efficient compression method.

Method: The proposed method focuses on machine-vision-oriented compression as a foundation, with a plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy for machine vision tasks. It then adds semantic data progressively to incorporate human-vision details using a diffusion-based approach, called Diff-FCHM (Diffusion-Prior based Feature Compression for Human and Machine Visions).

Result: Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed Diff-FCHM method, outperforming existing methods in both human-vision and machine-vision tasks by significant margins.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes a more efficient machine-vision-based collaborative compression pipeline that benefits both machine efficiency and human-vision restoration. This method is an advance over traditional human-vision compression pipelines.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

*Hanbo Cheng,Peng Wang,Kaixiang Lei,Qi Li,Zhen Zou,Pengfei Hu,Jun Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses inference latency in diffusion models by combining trajectory-based and distribution-based methods into a Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework, improving efficiency and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the latency barrier in diffusion models while maintaining high fidelity and stable training.

Method: The authors propose Hierarchical Distillation (HD), which uses trajectory-based distillation to initialize a structural sketch and distribution-based refinement with a novel Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD).

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, including an FID of 2.26 on ImageNet $256\times256$ in a single step and strong generalizability on other datasets.

Conclusion: The HD framework and AWD introduce a promising paradigm for fast, high-fidelity diffusion models, rivaling multi-step generators.

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

*Yipeng Zou,Qin Liu,Jie Wu,Yu Peng,Guo Chen,Hui Zhou,Guanghui Ye*

TL;DR: This paper introduces NAMEA, a novel ensemble attack method for improving adversarial transferability across heterogeneous model architectures. It focuses on leveraging gradients from the non-attention areas of models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve adversarial transferability across heterogeneous model architectures, overcoming the gradient variance challenge in ensemble attacks.

Method: NAMEA integrates gradients from non-attention areas using a meta-learning approach to effectively merge transfer information from CNNs and ViTs.

Result: Empirical evaluations on the ImageNet dataset show NAMEA outperforms state-of-the-art methods AdaEA and SMER by 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively.

Conclusion: NAMEA's utilization of ensemble non-attention gradients enhances cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into ensemble attack design.

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

*Yuxi Liu,Dengchao Jin,Shuai Huo,Jiawen Gu,Chao Zhou,Huihui Bai,Ming Lu,Zhan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel neural B-frame video compression method called BRHVC to achieve better video compression performance through bi-directional reference harmonization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored field of neural B-frame video compression and enhance reference information utilization for more balanced and better compression.

Method: The BRHVC method employs Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) for accurate motion compensation and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF) to optimize reference context modeling.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that BRHVC outperforms state-of-the-art neural video compression methods and even traditional coding methods like VTM-RA on HEVC datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed BRHVC method achieves significant improvements in bi-directional reference harmonization for video compression, contributing to advancements in neural video coding techniques.

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

*Haowei Zhang,Yuanpei Zhao,Jizhe Zhou,Mao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Hausdorff Dimension (HD) into Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) to address their limited diversity while preserving visual quality. Through optimization and sampling strategies, the method improves diversity significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FGMs excel at generating high-quality images but struggle with diversity due to self-similarity. This paper aims to enhance diversity without compromising image quality.

Method: The authors propose incorporating the Hausdorff Dimension (HD) concept via a learnable HD estimation method, HD-based loss with momentum-driven scheduling, and HD-guided rejection sampling.

Result: FGM-HD framework improves output diversity by 39% compared to vanilla FGMs, as validated by experiments on the ImageNet dataset.

Conclusion: The incorporation of HD into FGMs successfully enhances diversity while maintaining high-quality results, marking a theoretical and practical advancement in image generation.

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

*RuiQiang Zhang,Zehua Ma,Guanjie Wang,Chang Liu,Hengyi Wang,Weiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AuthSig, a framework for static electronic signatures using generative models and watermarks to bind authentication information, achieving over 98% extraction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static scanned signatures are still common due to their convenience but lack reliable authentication and are prone to misuse, necessitating a secure alternative.

Method: The method involves using generative models and style modulation to encode watermark bits invisibly into signature images, coupled with a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy to handle handwritten signature data scarcity.

Result: AuthSig achieved over 98% watermark extraction accuracy and demonstrated robustness under both digital and print-scan scenarios.

Conclusion: AuthSig provides a secure and effective solution for the authentication of static electronic signatures with robustness in practical use cases like degradation and print-scan.

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoDR, a new method for improving in-context learning by using a coreset-based dual retrieval strategy to select effective and efficient demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current demonstration selection strategies for in-context learning are either inefficient or suboptimal due to the NP-hard nature of the task, necessitating a better framework.

Method: The authors propose CoDR, which uses a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset and a dual retrieval mechanism for efficient and effective demonstration selection.

Result: Experimental results show that CoDR outperforms existing demonstration selection methods in improving in-context learning performance.

Conclusion: The CoDR framework achieves a better balance between efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection, enhancing the performance of large visual language models in in-context learning.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in LiDAR place recognition and localisation in cluttered and diverse environments, such as forests and urban settings.

Method: Utilizes an octree-based transformer for hierarchical descriptor extraction and proposes a multi-scale geometric verification module for improved re-ranking and registration accuracy.

Result: Achieves superior Recall@1 and localisation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, with runtime improvements and error reductions.

Conclusion: HOTFLoc++ significantly enhances place recognition and localisation in challenging scenarios, demonstrating reliability and performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces WDT-MD, a framework aimed at improving automated detection of microaneurysms, the earliest signs of Diabetic Retinopathy, overcoming current challenges in diffusion-based anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the labor-intensive and error-prone nature of manual screening for microaneurysms (MAs) and limitations in automated approaches for accurate MA detection.

Method: The framework employs noise-encoded image conditioning, synthesis of pseudo-normal patterns via inpainting, and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture combining global modeling with multi-scale wavelet analysis.

Result: The proposed WDT-MD demonstrates superior performance in MA detection compared to existing methods, validated on IDRiD and e-ophtha datasets.

Conclusion: The developed WDT-MD framework effectively enhances microaneurysm detection, offering significant potential for better early screening of Diabetic Retinopathy.

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

*Xinyu Wang,Wenjun Yao,Fanghui Song,Zhichang Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new image segmentation model within the ICTM framework, designed to perform better on images with heavy noise and intensity inhomogeneities by incorporating advanced denoising techniques and optimization schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image segmentation methods struggle with managing noisy images and intensity inhomogeneity, necessitating a model that can handle such real-world scenarios effectively.

Method: The proposed method integrates an I-divergence term, adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, and smoothly varying bias field to improve noise handling and segmentation. It employs a spatially adaptive weight for region-specific diffusion and optimizes via the RMSAV scheme.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms existing approaches in segmentation accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The model successfully addresses challenges of noisy images and intensity variations, making it effective for segmentation in diverse real-world conditions.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

*Jiazhou Zhou,Qing Jiang,Kanghao Chen,Lutao Jiang,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Ying-Cong Chen,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces T-Rex-Omni, a framework for open-set object detection that incorporates both positive and negative visual prompts to enhance detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-set object detectors struggle with visually similar but semantically different distractors due to their reliance on positive-only prompts.

Method: T-Rex-Omni uses a unified visual prompt encoder for both positive and negative prompts, alongside new techniques like Negating Negative Computing (NNC) and Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss to process and suppress negative responses effectively.

Result: The framework significantly improves zero-shot detection performance and reduces the gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods, especially excelling in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

Conclusion: Introducing negative prompts adds an essential dimension to open-set visual recognition, advancing object detection systems to handle complex scenarios more effectively.

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

*Liu Yu,Zhonghao Chen,Ping Kuang,Zhikun Feng,Fan Zhou,Lan Wang,Gillian Dobbie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) by introducing 'Owl,' a causally-grounded framework that optimizes attention mechanisms to reduce hallucinations and improve model faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the persistent issue of object hallucination in LVLMs, where the generated content does not match the visual inputs. Existing solutions fail to address the combined influence of visual and textual elements.

Method: The method involves the creation of 'Owl,' which models hallucinations using a structural causal graph. A new metric, VTACR, is introduced to quantify modality imbalance, and fine-grained attention interventions and a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy are applied to reduce hallucinations.

Result: The proposed Owl framework shows significant improvement in mitigating hallucinations, achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in faithfulness on benchmarks like POPE and CHAIR.

Conclusion: Owl successfully reduces hallucinations in LVLMs while maintaining their vision-language understanding capabilities, demonstrating its efficacy through experimental results.

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Our model supports flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency by adjusting the number of scales utilized. Additionally, we introduce a fully spatial correlation module to further improve accuracy while maintaining low computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve photovoltaic power systems by overcoming limitations of current approaches to ground-based remote sensing cloud image extrapolation, such as feature extraction inefficiency, inadequate temporal guidance, and high computational costs.

Method: Developed USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network, with an encoder-decoder framework, adaptive large-kernel convolutions, low-complexity attention mechanisms, and novel sub-modules to model spatiotemporal dependencies efficiently.

Result: USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency on the newly introduced ASI-CIS dataset.

Conclusion: USF-Net resolves key challenges in ground-based cloud extrapolation and provides a robust solution, supported by a novel benchmark dataset, to advance photovoltaic system development.

Abstract: Ground-based remote sensing cloud image sequence extrapolation is a key research area in the development of photovoltaic power systems. However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common "ghosting effect." It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset. Extensive experiments on ASI-CIS demonstrate that USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a superior balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for ground-based cloud extrapolation. The dataset and source code will be available at https://github.com/she1110/ASI-CIS.

Abstract: Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image dehazing faces challenges such as limited scene adaptability in prior-based methods and high computational complexity with color distortion in deep learning approaches. To address these issues, we propose 4KDehazeFlow, a novel method based on Flow Matching and the Haze-Aware vector field. This method models the dehazing process as a progressive optimization of continuous vector field flow, providing efficient data-driven adaptive nonlinear color transformation for high-quality dehazing. Specifically, our method has the following advantages: 1) 4KDehazeFlow is a general method compatible with various deep learning networks, without relying on any specific network architecture. 2) We propose a learnable 3D lookup table (LUT) that encodes haze transformation parameters into a compact 3D mapping matrix, enabling efficient inference through precomputed mappings. 3) We utilize a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver to stably solve the dehazing flow field through an accurate step-by-step iterative method, effectively suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments show that 4KDehazeFlow exceeds seven state-of-the-art methods. It delivers a 2dB PSNR increase and better performance in dense haze and color fidelity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAN, a world model enabling high-quality video simulations conditioned on history and natural language actions, surpassing limitations of existing models with interactivity, causality, and long-term consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of video generation models in controllability and long-horizon consistency and conventional world modeling efforts restricted to specific domains, aiming to create a general, interactive, and predictive world model.

Method: The study employs a Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture combining an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone grounded in a large language model and a video diffusion decoder, trained on large-scale video-action pairs for open-domain simulation.

Result: PAN demonstrates strong performance in action-conditioned simulation, long-term forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other models, showing potential as a general world model.

Conclusion: PAN represents a step toward general-purpose world models capable of long-term predictive simulation for reasoning and action, unifying imagination with realizable dynamics.

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

*Hai-Dang Nguyen,Minh-Anh Dang,Minh-Tan Le,Minh-Tuan Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VietMEAgent, an AI framework tailored for Vietnamese cultural understanding in Visual Question Answering, offering explainable answers and integrating cultural object detection and structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Visual Question Answering systems struggle with culturally specific content due to limited representation in training data and lack of interpretability for users.

Method: VietMEAgent combines a cultural object detection backbone, program generation layer, curated Vietnamese cultural knowledge base, and dual-modality explanation module for reasoning and transparency.

Result: A Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset is created and used to show the system's effectiveness in providing explainable answers tied to cultural knowledge.

Conclusion: VietMEAgent enhances cultural AI with transparent explanations and sensitivity, supporting education and cultural preservation while addressing limitations in reasoning and training data.

Abstract: Contemporary Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems remain constrained when confronted with culturally specific content, largely because cultural knowledge is under-represented in training corpora and the reasoning process is not rendered interpretable to end users. This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled. A curated knowledge base of Vietnamese cultural entities serves as an explicit source of background information, while a dual-modality explanation module combines attention-based visual evidence with structured, human-readable textual rationales. We further construct a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset sourced from public repositories and use it to demonstrate the practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI. The resulting system provides transparent explanations that disclose both the computational rationale and the underlying cultural context, supporting education and cultural preservation with an emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity.

### [134] [Diversifying Counterattacks: Orthogonal Exploration for Robust CLIP Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09064)
*Chengze Jiang,Minjing Dong,Xinli Shi,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the DOC method to enhance adversarial robustness in Vision-language Pre-training Models by generating diverse counterattacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in adversarial robustness in Vision-language Pre-training Models, emphasizing the lack of diverse counterattacks.

Method: Propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which uses orthogonal gradient directions, momentum-based updates, and a sensitivity score to improve counterattack diversity and effectiveness.

Result: Demonstrated DOC's improved robustness across 16 datasets against diverse attacks while maintaining clean accuracy.

Conclusion: DOC enhances adversarial robustness effectively through increased diversity of counterattacks, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates Composition-Incremental Learning (CompIL) to enhance compositional generalization in real-world scenarios with nearly infinite compositions, introducing benchmarks and an effective framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data has infinite, evolving compositions, necessitating models to incrementally improve their compositional generalization capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a pseudo-replay framework with a visual synthesizer for learning representations and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to preserve primitive alignment during incremental learning.

Result: Evaluation on newly developed benchmarks (MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL) confirms the effectiveness of the proposed framework in compositional zero-shot learning.

Conclusion: CompIL enhances compositional zero-shot learning by progressively improving generalization capabilities using innovative methodologies and benchmarks.

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### [136] [Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation for Vision--Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09101)
*Byunghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UL-TTA, a lightweight test-time adaptation framework for vision-language models, addressing domain shift issues without modifying backbone parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models struggle with feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and miscalibration under domain shifts. Test-time adaptation often demands heavy computational resources, unsuitable for streaming/edge scenarios.

Method: UL-TTA adapts logit-level parameters (class prototypes, class priors, temperature) with an EM-style update. It employs selective filtering, Bayesian updates, decoupled temperatures, and guards against drift in long streams.

Result: UL-TTA improves top-1 accuracy (+4.7 points on average) over zero-shot CLIP while reducing ECE by 20-30% across diverse benchmarks. It achieves this with minimal latency overhead and robust performance for up to 200K samples.

Conclusion: Logit-level Bayesian adaptation suffices to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and calibration for VLMs under domain shifts without updating backbone parameters.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition by comparing image embeddings to text-derived class prototypes. However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse. Our results demonstrate that logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs for VLMs under domain shift, without updating any backbone parameters.

*Rui-Yang Ju,Kohei Yamashita,Hirotaka Kameko,Shinsuke Mori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset to improve Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on pre-modern Japanese cursive script under noisy conditions, alongside defining benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OCR models for Kuzushiji struggle with document degradation and seals, and no suitable dataset previously existed to address these OCR challenges.

Method: This study develops and introduces the DKDS dataset and defines benchmark tasks: text and seal detection and document binarization. It utilizes YOLO models for detection benchmarks and K-means clustering or GAN-based methods for document binarization.

Result: Baseline results for the two benchmark tasks show varying performance across YOLO models and binarization methods, providing a foundation for further OCR improvements.

Conclusion: The DKDS dataset serves as a vital benchmark for advancing OCR capabilities in challenging degraded Kuzushiji documents and is publicly accessible for further research.

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

*ChunLiang Wu,Tsunhua Yang,Hungying Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PIFF, a physics-informed generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation, addressing limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flood mapping methods are limited by inefficiency and unreliability, requiring innovative approaches for better flood prediction.

Method: The authors developed PIFF, which maps DEM to flood depth predictions using a physics-informed generative model incorporating hydrodynamic priors, a rainfall encoder, and causality relationships.

Result: Using data from Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios, PIFF was found to provide accurate, real-time flood depth estimations and replace costly simulations.

Conclusion: PIFF is a promising data-driven solution for real-time flood mapping, combining physical constraints with neural networks for efficient and reliable predictions.

Abstract: Flood mapping is crucial for assessing and mitigating flood impacts, yet traditional methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography face limitations in efficiency and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MACEval, a multi-agent continual evaluation framework for evaluating large models dynamically, addressing issues with traditional benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for large models are closed-ended, prone to overfitting, lack sustainability, and are heavily dependent on human curation, making it difficult to evaluate evolving model capabilities effectively.

Method: The paper proposes MACEval, an autonomous multi-agent network employing role assignment, in-process data generation, and cascaded agent network evaluation for dynamic model assessment. New metrics for longitudinal and sustainable performance quantification are introduced.

Result: MACEval demonstrates human-free, efficient, economical, flexible, and scalable evaluation capabilities across 9 tasks and 23 large models with autonomous processes and reduced data requirements.

Conclusion: MACEval offers a promising framework for dynamically evaluating large models, minimizing human involvement, and helping adapt benchmarks to advancing AI capabilities.

Abstract: Hundreds of benchmarks dedicated to evaluating large models from multiple perspectives have been presented over the past few years. Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies. We hope that MACEval can broaden future directions of large model evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper presents PressTrack-HMR, a method for multi-person global human mesh recovery using pressure signals from tactile mats, addressing occlusion and privacy challenges in traditional vision-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional vision-based human mesh recovery methods in real-world scenarios, such as occlusions, poor lighting, and privacy concerns, by leveraging tactile information from pressure mats.

Method: PressTrack-HMR introduces a top-down pipeline with a tracking-by-detection strategy to identify, segment, and perform human mesh recovery from individual pressure signals in multi-person scenarios.

Result: The method achieves 89.2 mm MPJPE and 112.6 mm WA-MPJPE100, demonstrating high performance in multi-person HMR using pressure data.

Conclusion: PressTrack-HMR highlights the potential of pressure-based data for privacy-preserving, occlusion-free human mesh recovery in multi-person scenarios and includes a novel multi-person interaction pressure dataset for further research.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

*Yanlin Wu,Xiaogang Yuan,Dezhi An*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DBINDS, a novel detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics for AI-generated video detection. It demonstrates superior cross-generator performance using optimized features and a LightGBM classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated videos are rapidly advancing, creating challenges for content security and forensic analysis. Existing methods relying on pixel-level cues struggle to generalize to unseen generators.

Method: DBINDS uses diffusion-model inversion to recover initial noise sequences, creating Initial Noise Difference Sequences (INDS). It extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features for classification using a Bayesian-tuned LightGBM model.

Result: DBINDS, even when trained on a single generator, outperforms existing detectors and showcases robust generalization across different video generators in limited-data scenarios.

Conclusion: DBINDS leverages latent dynamics rather than pixel cues, improving content security by offering stronger generalization, robustness, and performance in AI-generated video detection.

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust evaluation framework for assessing multimodal large language models (LLMs) in dermatology diagnostics using DermBench and DermEval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable evaluation of multimodal LLMs for generating dermatology diagnostic narratives remains a key challenge for their clinical deployment.

Method: The authors developed DermBench, a curated benchmark with expert-certified narratives and DermEval, an automatic evaluator for structured case critique and scoring.

Result: DermBench and DermEval closely align with expert ratings, achieving mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117, respectively, across 4,500 cases.

Conclusion: The framework provides reliable, clinically grounded, and scalable assessment of multimodal LLMs, supporting responsible clinical application and improvement of diagnostic models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TACO, a framework to minimize hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through self-verification and confidence calibration techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of hallucinations in MLLMs, such as errors in object existence, attributes, and relations, to improve their reliability.

Method: TACO decomposes complex responses into atomic queries, paraphrases these queries, estimates confidence through self-consistency or self-confidence aggregation, and refines responses using language models.

Result: Experiments across five benchmarks and with two MLLMs (	exttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and 	exttt{CogVLM2}) demonstrate that TACO consistently reduces biases, improves confidence calibration, and enhances response faithfulness.

Conclusion: TACO effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs without relying on external vision experts, proving its value in improving model reliability and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

*Kaixiang Shu,Kai Meng,Junqin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) for neural networks to spatially disentangle foreground and background information, enhancing model interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often conflate relevant foreground features with irrelevant background correlations, compromising interpretability and robustness. The authors aim to address this issue by redefining neural network interpretability using an information-theoretic perspective.

Method: The authors introduce S-IB, which maximizes mutual information between gradient-based foreground features and inputs while suppressing background information. They theorize that gradient-based attributions computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics and integrate this understanding into training.

Result: Experiments show that S-IB improves visualization quality in six explanation methods across five benchmarks, leading to better foreground feature focus and suppressed background interference. It also provides consistent classification accuracy gains.

Conclusion: Optimizing the spatial structure of gradient-based attributions during training refines neural network interpretability and maintains classification effectiveness, offering universal enhancements for post-hoc explanation methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically learn spatially entangled representations that conflate discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, thereby undermining model interpretability and robustness. We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel deployment scheme for Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) on resource-constrained edge devices using FPGA to achieve efficient video compression with higher energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to efficiently deploy the AGC algorithm on edge devices which face challenges like inflexible dynamic adaptation, high power consumption, and computational complexities.

Method: The authors combine network compression techniques like static quantization and layer fusion with FPGA-based hardware designing. They utilize software-hardware co-design and hardware processing units with optimization strategies like double-buffering and parallel computation.

Result: The proposed FPGA prototype using the PYNQ-Z1 platform achieves energy efficiencies significantly higher than CPUs and GPUs, with only 11.7 μJ for reconstructing one pixel.

Conclusion: The paper concludes the FPGA-based approach is feasible and highly energy-efficient for AGC deployment on edge devices, promoting advancements in talking-face video compression.

Abstract: The Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) is an emerging paradigm for talking-face video compression. However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \textbf{24.9$\times$} and \textbf{4.1$\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively. Specifically, only \textbf{11.7} microjoules ($\upmu$J) are required for one pixel reconstructed by this FPGA system.

TL;DR: This paper examines energy expenditure estimation via physiological signals, comparing classical and deep learning methods across various sensors and activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in systematically evaluating the impact of neural architectures and signal choices for energy expenditure estimation methods, while incorporating the role of inter-individual variability.

Method: Comparison of classical baselines with state-of-the-art deep learning models, including transformer, CNN, and ResNet architectures, on single, paired, and grouped sensor data for various activities.

Result: Transformers achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.87 W/kg using minute ventilation. Paired or grouped signals like Hexoskin data provided faster yet effective alternatives using CNN/ResNet. Performance varied by activity intensity, with better results in low-intensity tasks.

Conclusion: Minute ventilation is the most predictive signal for energy expenditure estimation. Deep models show promising accuracy, but inter-individual variability highlights the need for adaptive modeling strategies.

Abstract: Energy expenditure estimation aims to infer human metabolic rate from physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or accelerometer data, and has been studied primarily with classical regression methods. The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies.

Method: RichKD fuses logits and features from a visual teacher with CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance to capture dataset-specific and semantically enriched knowledge, enhancing the distillation quality.

Result: RichKD consistently outperforms most existing methods, improving accuracy, robustness under distribution shifts, and input corruptions, while refining logit distributions and increasing prediction confidence.

Conclusion: RichKD effectively enriches knowledge distillation by leveraging cross-modal supervision and fused visual-language cues, demonstrating improved prediction consistency and KD outcomes.

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

*Shengqi Dang,Fu Chai,Jiaxin Li,Chao Yuan,Wei Ye,Nan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DensiCrafter, an optimization framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures using density fields and physically constrained loss terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D generative models prioritize geometry and texture synthesis, often neglecting physical constraints and manufacturability, which limits practical applications.

Method: DensiCrafter optimizes density fields derived from coarse voxel grids using three differentiable, physically constrained loss terms. Mass regularization reduces unnecessary material, ensuring lightweight designs, while the outer surface is preserved via restricted optimization.

Result: The framework achieved a 43% reduction in material mass in text-to-3D tasks while maintaining geometric fidelity and stability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Hollow designs were successfully fabricated in real-world 3D printing.

Conclusion: DensiCrafter effectively integrates physical constraints into 3D design generation, enabling the production of lightweight, self-supporting hollow structures ready for real-world fabrication.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

*Le Yi,Wei Huang,Lei Zhang,Kefu Zhao,Yan Wang,Zizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation using a novel feedback mechanism within the teacher-student framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation struggles with error propagation due to inherent ambiguities and self-reinforcing biases in the teacher-student paradigm.

Method: The paper incorporates a feedback mechanism in the teacher-student framework, where the student provides feedback on teacher-induced changes, refining pseudo-labels. It introduces a dual-teacher feedback model for resolving disagreements and avoiding consistent errors.

Result: Evaluations on three medical image benchmarks indicate that the feedback mechanism effectively mitigates error propagation in semi-supervised segmentation.

Conclusion: The introduced feedback mechanism enhances error correction within the teacher-student paradigm, improving semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, tackling challenges in computational cost and accuracy degradation during quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies and accuracy degradation in quantizing PETRs for multi-view 3D detection, making deployment in autonomous driving feasible.

Method: Three innovations: QFPE for embedding alignment, DULUT for approximating non-linear functions, and QANS for stabilizing quantization post-softmax operations.

Result: FQ-PETR achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, outperforming existing quantization methods.

Conclusion: FQ-PETR successfully addresses quantization challenges, preserving accuracy and significantly enhancing computational efficiency for PETRs in multi-view 3D detection scenarios.

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

*Houzhang Fang,Shukai Guo,Qiuhuan Chen,Yi Chang,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents TDCNet, a novel method for detecting small moving infrared targets by enhancing spatio-temporal features using a novel Temporal Difference Convolution (TDC) module and a cross-attention mechanism. It achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of detecting moving infrared small targets (moving IRSTD) in complex backgrounds due to weak signals and background interference, ensuring accurate spatio-temporal modeling.

Method: The authors propose TDCNet, which integrates a Temporal Difference Convolution (TDC) module to fuse temporal differences and 3D convolutions, capturing multi-scale motion features and suppressing background clutter. Additionally, a spatio-temporal attention mechanism refines target feature extraction through cross-attention.

Result: TDCNet shows superior detection results and outperforms existing methods on the IRSTD-UAV dataset and other public infrared datasets.

Conclusion: TDCNet provides a robust solution for moving infrared small target detection by effectively combining temporal difference and 3D convolutions, enhancing performance in challenging scenarios with complex backgrounds.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

*Yang Chen,Miaoge Li,Zhijie Rao,Deze Zeng,Song Guo,Jingcai Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new methodology called Flora for zero-shot skeleton action recognition. Flora overcomes existing challenges like fragile alignment and rigid classifiers, achieving robust alignment and improved decision accuracy through flexible semantic attunement and distribution-aware classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to handle challenges in recognizing unseen skeleton action categories due to lack of skeletal priors, and limitations in current methods such as weak point-to-point alignment and rigid classification boundaries.

Method: The proposed method, Flora, introduces flexible neighbor-aware semantic attunement and an open-form distribution-aware flow classifier for more robust alignment and fine-grained decision boundaries. This is achieved via geometric consistency objectives, noise-free flow matching, and contrastive regularization.

Result: Experiments on three datasets prove the method's effectiveness, showing strong performance, even with minimal (10%) training data from seen categories.

Conclusion: Flora provides a significant advancement for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, with robust alignment, fine-grained classification, and superior performance.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OUGS, a framework improving object-focused reconstructions in complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes by integrating semantic segmentation and physically grounded uncertainty metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently achieving high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes lacks effective methods due to irrelevant background clutter and inefficient view selection.

Method: The framework derives uncertainty from 3D Gaussian primitive physical parameters like position, scale, and rotation, applies rendering Jacobian propagation, and incorporates semantic segmentation to create targeted object uncertainty scores.

Result: Experiments show OUGS enhances 3DGS reconstruction efficiency and object quality and provides robust global scene uncertainty estimation, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: OUGS optimizes object-centric tasks by introducing physics-driven and interpretable uncertainty metrics, facilitating precise and efficient active view selection for 3DGS.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a new framework and dataset to improve bronchoscopy navigation accuracy, solving challenges from respiratory motion and pre-operative/intra-operative misalignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate localization during bronchoscopy is difficult due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and misalignment between pre-operative CT scans and intra-operative images.

Method: The paper proposes a vision-based pose optimization framework that registers 2D intra-operative endoscopy views with 3D pre-operative CT anatomy using a domain-invariant encoder and a differentiable depth refinement process. The authors also introduce a synthetic benchmark dataset for reproducible evaluations.

Result: The model, trained only on synthetic data, achieves excellent localization accuracy (average translational error: 2.65 mm, rotational error: 0.19 rad) and demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization on real patient data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a robust solution for bronchoscopy navigation with significant generalization capabilities while the benchmark enables standardized evaluations for future research.

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for American football players and evaluates various methods, showing that accuracy improves with fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No standardized dataset exists for analyzing and comparing multi-object tracking methods in American football, a challenging domain due to occlusion and physical contact.

Method: The researchers constructed a specialized dataset for American football player tracking and evaluated detection/tracking methods, integrating fine-tuned detection and re-identification models for improvement.

Result: Fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models yielded improved tracking accuracy in high-density scenarios involving American football players.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational dataset and shows that accurate detection and tracking in complex American football scenarios are achievable, addressing a previously underserved domain.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

*Ying Peng,Hongsen Ye,Changxin Huang,Xiping Hu,Jian Chen,Runhao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework to transfer knowledge from both Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNNs to enhance lightweight CNNs for video action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the trade-off between the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the computational efficiency of lightweight CNNs, improving CNNs without sacrificing practicality.

Method: The framework utilizes two components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting to adaptively combine the predictions of ViTs and CNNs, and (2) Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation, enabling the CNN student to learn structural differences between ViTs and CNNs via an auxiliary branch.

Result: Extensive experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms existing knowledge distillation techniques, with up to 5.95% accuracy improvement on the HMDB51 benchmark.

Conclusion: Leveraging a heterogeneous ViT teacher alongside a homogeneous CNN teacher offers a highly effective mechanism for improving lightweight CNNs, making them more practical while maintaining performance gains.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamPose3D is a diffusion-based framework for 3D human pose estimation, combining action-aware reasoning and temporal modeling with state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D human pose estimation struggle with ambiguous movements and lack temporal coherence due to reliance on geometric cues and independent frame prediction.

Method: DreamPose3D employs a diffusion process conditioned on action prompts extracted from 2D poses, kinematic joint-affinity-based attention encoding, and a hallucinative pose decoder for training coherent 3D pose sequences.

Result: DreamPose3D achieved state-of-the-art results on Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets, and showed strong robustness in testing on a noisy broadcast baseball dataset.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrated improved temporal coherence and intent reasoning with strong generalization to real-world scenarios, addressing key limitations in existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

TL;DR: vMFCoOp framework improves LLM and CLIP alignment for robust biomedical VLM prompting and few-shot classification using von Mises-Fisher distributions on hyperspherical manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical vision-language models (VLMs) face challenges in prompt learning due to misaligned semantics between LLMs and CLIP, limited scalability, and suboptimal multimodal alignment methods in complex biomedical applications.

Method: vMFCoOp leverages von Mises-Fisher distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold with Unified Semantic Anchors for robust alignment of semantic biases and geometric constraints.

Result: vMFCoOp achieves consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances few-shot classification, generalization, and clinical applicability in biomedical imaging; aims to expand applications further with open resources.

Abstract: Recent advances in context optimization (CoOp) guided by large language model (LLM)-distilled medical semantic priors offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering and full fine-tuning for adapting biomedical CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs). However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability. This work will be continuously expanded to encompass more downstream applications, and the corresponding resources are intended to be shared through https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui.

TL;DR: RF-DETR introduces a specialized lightweight detection transformer optimized for diverse datasets through weight-sharing neural architecture search, achieving enhanced accuracy-latency Pareto curves compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary detectors often fail to generalize to real-world datasets with new classes outside their pre-training, prompting the need for domain-specialized and efficient models.

Method: The method utilizes neural architecture search (NAS) on a pre-trained base network to identify optimal configurations for accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. It also improves DETRs' transferability by refining tunable knobs.

Result: RF-DETR achieves significant performance improvements on COCO (e.g., 48.0 AP for nano) and Roboflow100-VL datasets, outperforming competing methods in accuracy while maintaining or improving latency.

Conclusion: RF-DETR establishes new benchmarks in real-time detection performance and transferability across datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of light-weight specialist models for real-world applications.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary detectors achieve impressive performance on COCO, but often fail to generalize to real-world datasets with out-of-distribution classes not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the "tunable knobs" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast. To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR (2x-large) is the first real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO. Our code is at https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the slowdown of Moore's Law by leveraging FPGAs for HPC workload acceleration and improving the portability and flexibility of FPGA-targeted compilation.

Method: The method involves combining MLIR OpenMP dialect with a High-Level Synthesis dialect to create a portable and composable compilation flow for FPGAs, supporting multiple front ends like Flang.

Result: The integration demonstrates reduced development effort, increased flexibility, and the possibility to optimize offloaded FPGA kernels using standard OpenMP directives.

Conclusion: This work provides a new, extensible framework for directive-based FPGA acceleration, leveraging the MLIR ecosystem for improved portability and efficiency.

Abstract: With the slowing of Moore's Law, heterogeneous computing platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have gained increasing interest for accelerating HPC workloads. In this work we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first implementation of selective code offloading to FPGAs via the OpenMP target directive within MLIR. Our approach combines the MLIR OpenMP dialect with a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) dialect to provide a portable compilation flow targeting FPGAs. Unlike prior OpenMP FPGA efforts that rely on custom compilers, by contrast we integrate with MLIR and so support any MLIR-compatible front end, demonstrated here with Flang. Building upon a range of existing MLIR building blocks significantly reduces the effort required and demonstrates the composability benefits of the MLIR ecosystem. Our approach supports manual optimisation of offloaded kernels through standard OpenMP directives, and this work establishes a flexible and extensible path for directive-based FPGA acceleration integrated within the MLIR ecosystem.

*Liuzixuan Lin,Andrew A. Chien*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper explores datacenter (DC) load decoupling as a method to reduce carbon emissions and improve grid renewable absorption, optimizing its distribution and management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing energy demands of AI and cloud datacenters exacerbate concerns about their environmental impact, particularly due to conflicts between constant energy needs and volatile renewable energy generation. DC flexibility is viewed as crucial to mitigate these challenges.

Method: The study defines and quantifies energy requirements for datacenter load decoupling, evaluates distribution and management strategies, and assesses the economic feasibility of decoupling.

Result: Optimized decoupling achieves over 98% of potential carbon reduction with 70% of the total decoupling need. Cooperative management further boosts grid carbon reduction by 1.4x compared to limited information sharing. Furthermore, decoupling shows potential economic benefits for datacenters, although grid intervention may be necessary for equitable benefits across locations.

Conclusion: Proper distribution and management of datacenter load decoupling can significantly reduce carbon emissions and deliver cost benefits. However, uneven site-specific advantages may necessitate intervention from grid operators or policymakers to ensure widespread adoption.

Abstract: The exploding power consumption of AI and cloud datacenters (DCs) intensifies the long-standing concerns about their carbon footprint, especially because DCs' need for constant power clashes with volatile renewable generation needed for grid decarbonization. DC flexibility (a.k.a. load adaptation) is a key to reducing DC carbon emissions by improving grid renewable absorption.
  DC flexibility can be created, without disturbing datacenter capacity by decoupling a datacenter's power capacity and grid load with a collection of energy resources. Because decoupling can be costly, we study how to best distribute and manage decoupling to maximize benefits for all. Key considerations include site variation and datacenter-grid cooperation.
  We first define and compute the power and energy needs of datacenter load decoupling, and then we evaluate designed distribution and management approaches. Evaluation shows that optimized distribution can deliver >98% of the potential grid carbon reduction with 70% of the total decoupling need. For management, DC-grid cooperation (2-way sharing and control vs. 1-way info sharing) enables 1.4x grid carbon reduction. Finally, we show that decoupling may be economically viable, as on average datacenters can get power cost and carbon emissions benefits greater than their local costs of decoupling. However, skew across sites suggests grid intervention may be required.

### [162] [Evaluating HPC-Style CPU Performance and Cost in Virtualized Cloud Infrastructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08948)
*Jay Tharwani,Shobhit Aggarwal,Arnab A Purkayastha*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance and cost-effectiveness of major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI) for HPC-style workloads, focusing on CPU instance types from Intel, AMD, and ARM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how performance and cost vary among leading cloud providers and instance types to guide better decisions for HPC workload placement.

Method: The study uses OpenMP workloads from the SPEC ACCEL suite to benchmark the runtime and cost across Intel, AMD, and ARM-based virtual machine instances on AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI, under on-demand and discounted pricing models.

Result: AWS delivers the best performance at a higher cost, OCI is the most cost-effective but slower, Azure shows mid-range performance and cost, and GCP performance varies significantly based on the instance type. AWS ARM instances outperform its Intel and AMD counterparts by up to 49% in runtime.

Conclusion: Cloud provider and instance type selection significantly impact HPC workload performance and costs. This study emphasizes the importance of aligning workload priorities with instance and cloud provider characteristics to optimize performance and minimize expenses.

Abstract: This paper evaluates HPC-style CPU performance and cost in virtualized cloud infrastructures using a subset of OpenMP workloads in the SPEC ACCEL suite. Four major cloud providers by market share AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are compared across Intel, AMD, and ARM general purpose instance types under both on-demand and one-year discounted pricing. AWS consistently delivers the shortest runtime in all three instance types, yet charges a premium, especially for on-demand usage. OCI emerges as the most economical option across all CPU families, although it generally runs workloads more slowly than AWS. Azure often exhibits mid-range performance and cost, while GCP presents a mixed profile: it sees a notable boost when moving from Intel to AMD. On the other hand, its ARM instance is more than twice as slow as its own AMD offering and remains significantly more expensive. AWS's internal comparisons reveal that its ARM instance can outperform its Intel and AMD siblings by up to 49 percent in runtime. These findings highlight how instance choices and provider selection can yield substantial variations in both runtime and price, indicating that workload priorities, whether raw speed or cost minimization, should guide decisions on instance types.

*Zilinghan Li,Aditya Sinha,Yijiang Li,Kyle Chard,Kibaek Kim,Ravi Madduri*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of an enterprise-level federated learning framework (APPFL) that is scalable, user-friendly, and privacy-preserving, focusing on bridging research prototypes and deployment across diverse infrastructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in creating scalable and privacy-preserving federated learning frameworks suitable for enterprise-scale applications, considering data privacy and compliance constraints in scientific domains.

Method: The paper outlines key capabilities for the framework, such as scalable simulation, seamless deployment transition, distributed infrastructure support, user-friendly abstractions, and advanced privacy measures like differential privacy and secure aggregation.

Result: The proposed architectural designs could enable federated learning frameworks to move from prototyping to real-world deployment while ensuring scalability, reliability, and privacy.

Conclusion: The framework aims to transform scientific federated learning by providing scalable and privacy-protecting solutions adaptable to diverse infrastructures.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enabling collaborative model training without centralized data sharing, a crucial requirement in scientific domains where data privacy, ownership, and compliance constraints are critical. However, building user-friendly enterprise-level FL frameworks that are both scalable and privacy-preserving remains challenging, especially when bridging the gap between local prototyping and distributed deployment across heterogeneous client computing infrastructures. In this paper, based on our experiences building the Advanced Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (APPFL) framework, we present our vision for an enterprise-grade, privacy-preserving FL framework designed to scale seamlessly across computing environments. We identify several key capabilities that such a framework must provide: (1) Scalable local simulation and prototyping to accelerate experimentation and algorithm design; (2) seamless transition from simulation to deployment; (3) distributed deployment across diverse, real-world infrastructures, from personal devices to cloud clusters and HPC systems; (4) multi-level abstractions that balance ease of use and research flexibility; and (5) comprehensive privacy and security through techniques such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, robust authentication, and confidential computing. We further discuss architectural designs to realize these goals. This framework aims to bridge the gap between research prototypes and enterprise-scale deployment, enabling scalable, reliable, and privacy-preserving AI for science.

*Myungsu Kim,Ikjun Yeom,Younghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Flex-MIG is a software framework designed to improve GPU cluster utilization by addressing the inefficiencies of NVIDIA MIG's one-to-one allocation model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving GPU utilization in multi-tenant settings, where underutilization and resource fragmentation often occur with existing GPU-sharing technologies like NVIDIA MIG.

Method: Flex-MIG introduces a software-only approach that implements a one-to-many allocation model and enables host-shared-memory collectives across MIG instances, eliminating the need for hardware modifications.

Result: Flex-MIG significantly reduces fragmentation, avoids reconfiguration that requires draining, and improves makespan by up to 17% across various workload scenarios.

Conclusion: A software-coordinated layer, as introduced by Flex-MIG, can effectively improve the efficiency of GPU clusters by addressing the rigidity and underutilization issues of NVIDIA MIG.

Abstract: GPU clusters in multi-tenant settings often suffer from underutilization, making GPU-sharing technologies essential for efficient resource use. Among them, NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) has gained traction for providing hardware-level isolation that enables concurrent workloads without interference. However, MIG's hardware rigidity and the conventional one-to-one allocation model jointly lead to severe fragmentation and cluster-wide underutilization. We present Flex-MIG, a software-only framework that replaces one-to-one with a one-to-many allocation model and enables host-shared-memory collectives across MIG instances without hardware modification. Flex-MIG eliminates drain-required reconfiguration, reduces fragmentation, and improves makespan by up to 17% across diverse traces, showing that rethinking MIG's operational model as a software-coordinated layer substantially improves cluster efficiency.

### [165] [SPADA: A Spatial Dataflow Architecture Programming Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09447)
*Lukas Gianinazzi,Tal Ben-Nun,Torsten Hoefler*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPADA, a programming language for spatial dataflow architectures, addressing challenges in dataflow management and scalability with improved developer efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify programming and enhance usability on spatial dataflow architectures by addressing challenges in dataflow orchestration, routing, and scaling.

Method: Development of SPADA programming language with precise dataflow control, a formal semantic framework, and a compiler for Cerebras CSL, demonstrated through the GT4Py DSL.

Result: SPADA reduces code size by 6-8x compared to CSL and achieves scalable performance over three orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: SPADA unifies programming for spatial dataflow architectures, improving usability and performance while establishing robust theoretical underpinnings.

Abstract: Spatial dataflow architectures like the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine achieve exceptional performance in AI and scientific applications by leveraging distributed memory across processing elements (PEs) and localized computation. However, programming these architectures remains challenging due to the need for explicit orchestration of data movement through reconfigurable networks-on-chip and asynchronous computation triggered by data arrival. Existing FPGA and CGRA programming models emphasize loop scheduling but overlook the unique capabilities of spatial dataflow architectures, particularly efficient dataflow over regular grids and intricate routing management.
  We present SPADA, a programming language that provides precise control over data placement, dataflow patterns, and asynchronous operations while abstracting architecture-specific low-level details. We introduce a rigorous dataflow semantics framework for SPADA that defines routing correctness, data races, and deadlocks. Additionally, we design and implement a compiler targeting Cerebras CSL with multi-level lowering.
  SPADA serves as both a high-level programming interface and an intermediate representation for domain-specific languages (DSLs), which we demonstrate with the GT4Py stencil DSL. SPADA enables developers to express complex parallel patterns -- including pipelined reductions and multi-dimensional stencils -- in 6--8x less code than CSL with near-ideal weak scaling across three orders of magnitude. By unifying programming for spatial dataflow architectures under a single model, SPADA advances both the theoretical foundations and practical usability of these emerging high-performance computing platforms.

### [166] [Minimize Your Critical Path with Combine-and-Exchange Locks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09194)
*Simon König,Lukas Epple,Christian Becker*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES), a userspace synchronization approach, achieving significant performance improvements by optimizing critical sections and parallel workload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing userspace synchronization primitives mimic kernel-level approaches, causing unnecessary delays and limiting the throughput of highly parallel applications.

Method: The authors propose CES, a novel method to keep contended critical sections on the same thread while evenly distributing parallelizable tasks across other threads.

Result: CES achieved up to 3x improvement in application benchmarks and up to 8x improvement in microbenchmarks.

Conclusion: CES offers a more efficient userspace synchronization model, addressing delay issues and improving parallel application performance across diverse languages and libraries.

Abstract: Coroutines are experiencing a renaissance as many modern programming languages support the use of cooperative multitasking for highly parallel or asynchronous applications. One of the greatest advantages of this is that concurrency and synchronization is manged entirely in the userspace, omitting heavy-weight system calls. However, we find that state-of-the-art userspace synchronization primitives approach synchronization in the userspace from the perspective of kernel-level scheduling. This introduces unnecessary delays on the critical path of the application, limiting throughput. In this paper, we re-think synchronization for tasks that are scheduled entirely in the userspace (e.g., coroutines, fibers, etc.). We develop Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES), a novel scheduling approach that ensures contended critical sections stay on the same thread of execution while parallelizable work is evenly spread across the remaining threads. We show that our approach can be applied to many existing languages and libraries, resulting in 3-fold performance improvements in application benchmarks as well as 8-fold performance improvements in microbenchmarks.

### [167] [No Cords Attached: Coordination-Free Concurrent Lock-Free Queues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09410)
*Yusuf Motiwala*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cyclic Memory Protection (CMP), a coordination-free queue maintaining strict FIFO semantics, unbounded capacity, and lock-free progress, achieving simpler and more efficient designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concurrency in queue design introduces complexities often due to overprotection against reclamation issues (e.g., ABA problems), which becomes costly and inefficient at scale, especially in AI workloads.

Method: CMP uses bounded protection windows to achieve efficient reclamation, ensures strict FIFO ordering, and employs linearizability and bounded reclamation analysis for theoretical guarantees.

Result: CMP outperforms current lock-free queue implementations by 1.72-4x under high contention and demonstrates scalability across hundreds of threads.

Conclusion: CMP establishes that highly concurrent queues can retain simplicity and performance without sacrificing queue semantics, providing a better design for scalable workloads.

Abstract: The queue is conceptually one of the simplest data structures-a basic FIFO container. However, ensuring correctness in the presence of concurrency makes existing lock-free implementations significantly more complex than their original form. Coordination mechanisms introduced to prevent hazards such as ABA, use-after-free, and unsafe reclamation often dominate the design, overshadowing the queue itself. Many schemes compromise strict FIFO ordering, unbounded capacity, or lock-free progress to mask coordination overheads. Yet the true source of complexity lies in the pursuit of infinite protection against reclamation hazards--theoretically sound but impractical and costly. This pursuit not only drives unnecessary complexity but also creates a protection paradox where excessive protection reduces system resilience rather than improving it. While such costs may be tolerable in conventional workloads, the AI era has shifted the paradigm: training and inference pipelines involve hundreds to thousands of concurrent threads per node, and at this scale, protection and coordination overheads dominate, often far heavier than the basic queue operations themselves.
  This paper introduces Cyclic Memory Protection (CMP), a coordination-free queue that preserves strict FIFO semantics, unbounded capacity, and lock-free progress while restoring simplicity. CMP reclaims the strict FIFO that other approaches sacrificed through bounded protection windows that provide practical reclamation guarantees. We prove strict FIFO and safety via linearizability and bounded reclamation analysis, and show experimentally that CMP outperforms state-of-the-art lock-free queues by up to 1.72-4x under high contention while maintaining scalability to hundreds of threads. Our work demonstrates that highly concurrent queues can return to their fundamental simplicity without weakening queue semantics.

*Miroslav Popovic,Marko Popovic,Pavle Vasiljevic,Miodrag Djukic*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Python framework for FL and verifies three algorithms, focusing on the third (TDM communication).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formally verify a generic federated learning (FL) algorithm to ensure correctness and reliability in edge systems.

Method: Used CSP process algebra modeling and the PAT model checker to validate the third algorithm via safety and liveness properties.

Result: The study successfully verified the TDM communication algorithm, ensuring deadlock-freeness and proper termination.

Conclusion: The framework proves capable of enabling formal verification for critical FL algorithms, enhancing algorithm robustness and dependability.

Abstract: The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple FL framework targeting edge systems, which provides the three generic algorithms: the centralized federated learning, the decentralized federated learning, and the universal TDM communication in the current time slot. The first two were formally verified in a previous paper using the CSP process algebra, and in this paper, we use the same approach to formally verify the third one, in two phases. In the first phase, we construct the CSP model as a faithful representation of the real Python code. In the second phase, the model checker PAT automatically proves correctness of the third generic algorithm by proving its deadlock freeness (safety property) and successful termination (liveness property).

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper investigates multi-node distributed inference in large language models using GPU-based supercomputers and introduces a new hierarchical all-reduce algorithm (NVRAR) for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient scaling strategies across multiple GPUs and nodes due to the increasing size of LLMs and their computational demands.

Method: The authors conducted experiments using various inference engines (including the research prototype YALIS) to study model-parallel scaling behavior and performance bottlenecks. They also developed and integrated the NVRAR hierarchical all-reduce algorithm into YALIS.

Result: NVRAR demonstrated 1.9x-3.6x lower latency than existing approaches like NCCL for specific message sizes and a 1.72x reduction in end-to-end batch latency for the Llama 3.1 405B model in multi-node scenarios.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical performance challenges in distributed inference for LLMs and offers NVRAR as a significant improvement for multi-node workloads, showcasing its relevance in high-performance computing environments.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, distributed inference has become increasingly important. Model-parallel strategies must now efficiently scale not only across multiple GPUs but also across multiple nodes. In this work, we present a detailed performance study of multi-node distributed inference using LLMs on GPU-based supercomputers. We conduct experiments with several state-of-the-art inference engines alongside YALIS, a research-oriented prototype engine designed for controlled experimentation. We analyze the strong-scaling behavior of different model-parallel schemes and identify key bottlenecks. Since all-reduce operations are a common performance bottleneck, we develop NVRAR, a hierarchical all-reduce algorithm based on recursive doubling with NVSHMEM. NVRAR achieves up to 1.9x-3.6x lower latency than NCCL for message sizes between 128 KB and 2 MB on HPE Slingshot and InfiniBand interconnects. Integrated into YALIS, NVRAR achieves up to a 1.72x reduction in end-to-end batch latency for the Llama 3.1 405B model in multi-node decode-heavy workloads using tensor parallelism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and early detection of arrhythmias is crucial for better cardiac care, especially in real-time scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces a model combining 1D CNN, attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM for ECG classification and addresses class imbalance with a class-weighted loss function.

Result: The proposed model outperformed baseline models in accuracy and F1-score on the CPSC 2018 dataset, utilizing only 0.945 million parameters.

*Kaleem Ullah Qasim,Jiashu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAR is a training methodology that uses curriculum learning on architectural depth to reduce computational costs and improve training efficiency of recursive reasoning models, achieving faster training and improved inference performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recursive reasoning models are powerful but computationally expensive to train, which limits their adoption and further research.

Method: The authors propose CGAR, featuring Progressive Depth Curriculum (gradually increasing recursion depth during training) and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting (loss weighting aligned with gradient decay), reducing training time and preventing overfitting.

Result: CGAR achieves a 42% reduction in training cost (1.71x speedup) with minimal accuracy drop (0.63%), and improves inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning on architectural depth, as implemented in CGAR, allows recursive reasoning models to be trained efficiently on modest hardware, opening avenues for broader usage and further improvement.

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

*Rui Zhu,Yuexing Peng,George C. Alexandropoulos,Wenbo Wang,Wei Xiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhyKAN, a learnable and adaptive basis system for electromagnetic modeling, overcoming the static limitations of traditional methods like RWG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static, geometry-defined basis functions in electromagnetic modeling and to incorporate learnable, adaptive capabilities to improve modeling accuracy.

Method: The paper presents PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes the RWG basis. It integrates a local KAN branch and a global branch with physical consistency informed by Green's function priors.

Result: PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors and accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions across standard geometries.

Conclusion: PhyKAN bridges the gap between classical solvers and neural network models for electromagnetic modeling, offering interpretability and physics-consistency.

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) method that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters via task-agnostic restarts and time-varying Bayesian optimization, outperforming five existing PBT variants and other HPO algorithms without additional budget or hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of setting the number of steps between hyperparameter updates in Population Based Training (PBT) algorithms and improve efficiency in adjusting hyperparameters during neural network training.

Method: IPBT combines task-agnostic restarts that reuse weight information with time-varying Bayesian optimization to dynamically adjust hyperparameters during HPO.

Result: IPBT is shown to match or outperform five PBT variants and other HPO methods (random search, ASHA, SMAC3) across eight image classification and reinforcement learning tasks without additional budget or hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed IPBT method effectively improves hyperparameter optimization without requiring increased resources and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) can lift the burden of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) of neural networks. HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs.

TL;DR: TabPFN-2.5 is an enhanced foundation model for tabular data, showing significant performance improvements over previous models and industry benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable and high-performing tabular foundation model that can handle larger datasets and improve accuracy in classification and regression tasks.

Method: TabPFN-2.5 was developed for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features. It includes a new distillation engine for converting the model into compact, deployable structures like MLP or tree ensembles.

Result: TabPFN-2.5 outperformed tuned tree-based models, demonstrated superior accuracy compared to industry standards such as AutoGluon, and achieved high win rates against XGBoost for small to medium datasets.

Conclusion: TabPFN-2.5 marks a significant improvement in tabular AI, providing scalability, performance, and production-readiness, thereby strengthening the TabPFN ecosystem.

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the expressivity and interpretability of neural network states by encoding Turing-complete syntax within high-dimensional vector spaces.

Method: Implemented arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC) within the Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs) and extended VSA to encode Lisp 1.5.

Result: The approach allows neural network states to code for arbitrarily structured and interpretable representations, increasing their capability in machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: Structured representation encoding enhances neural network behavior, making them more general and intelligent for advanced tasks.

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

Result: Deep networks with longer prediction horizons recover latent structures, validated through linear and non-linear settings.

Conclusion: Predictive coding can induce structured representations under specific conditions, offering insights into its mechanisms and bridging empirical observations with theory.

Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

*Philipp Anthes,Dominik Sobania,Franz Rothlauf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSGP uses pre-trained transformer models for semantic program variation, achieving superior performance and compact solutions in symbolic regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve semantic genetic programming by leveraging transformer models for controlled variation of offspring programs.

Method: TSGP utilizes pre-trained transformer models to generate offspring programs, balancing semantic similarity and diverse structural variations.

Result: Evaluated on 24 datasets, TSGP outperforms existing GP methods, achieving high accuracy and producing compact solutions.

Conclusion: TSGP effectively balances exploration and exploitation, offering accurate and compact solutions with controlled semantic variations.

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

*Can Yang,Zhenzhong Wang,Junyuan Liu,Yunpeng Gong,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEGNet is a Physics-Embedded Graph Network designed to improve simulations of PDE-governed physical phenomena by integrating physical constraints and hierarchical architectures into graph neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional numerical solvers (high computational cost) and existing data-driven methods (error accumulation and poor physical consistency) in solving complex PDEs.

Method: The authors developed PEGNet, using PDE-guided message passing to embed key physical dynamics (convection, viscosity, diffusion) into distinct message functions of graph networks. They also used a hierarchical architecture for multi-scale feature capture and added physical regularization in the loss function.

Result: PEGNet demonstrated superior long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency compared to existing methods, validated on benchmarks like respiratory airflow and drug delivery datasets.

Conclusion: PEGNet provides an efficient, physically consistent alternative to existing solvers for PDE-related simulations while addressing key challenges in multiphysics and complex geometries.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

*David Sanchez,Holly Lopez,Michelle Buraczyk,Anantaa Kotal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAIRPLAI is a framework integrating human oversight into machine learning systems to balance accuracy, fairness, and privacy in decision-making contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in balancing accuracy, fairness, and privacy in machine learning systems impacting socially critical areas like healthcare and finance.

Method: FAIRPLAI introduces privacy-fairness trade-off visualizations, interactive stakeholder inputs, and private auditing loops to enable practical, domain-adaptable oversight.

Result: FAIRPLAI consistently achieves strong privacy protections and reduces fairness disparities compared to automated methods.

Conclusion: FAIRPLAI fosters responsible, effective, and interpretable AI systems by embedding human judgment in critical areas, ensuring trustworthiness in high-impact applications.

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

### [180] [Benevolent Dictators? On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08721)
*Andreas Einwiller,Kanishka Ghosh Dastidar,Artur Romazanov,Annette Hautli-Janisz,Michael Granitzer,Florian Lemmerich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations in studying AI agent behaviors in games like the dictator game. By focusing on the impact of system prompts, the proposed framework analyzes behavioral and linguistic patterns to improve insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address gaps in the current study of AI agent behaviors, particularly questioning the robustness of previous studies, which often ignore system prompt sensitivity in shaping behavioral outcomes.

Method: The authors propose the LLM-ABS framework to study AI agent behaviors with a focus on three components: the role of system prompts, using neutral prompt variations for reliability, and examining linguistic features of responses.

Result: Key findings include AI agents often showing a preference for fairness and a significant impact of system prompts on behavior. Linguistic analysis also reveals distinct response patterns influenced by prompts.

Conclusion: A robust framework is proposed for better studying LLM agent behaviors, highlighting challenges like prompt sensitivity, while contributing a foundation for future robust analyses.

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

### [181] [Macroscopic Emission Modeling of Urban Traffic Using Probe Vehicle Data: A Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08722)
*Mohammed Ali El Adlouni,Ling Jin,Xiaodan Xu,C. Anna Spurlock,Alina Lazar,Kaveh Farokhi Sadabadi,Mahyar Amirgholy,Mona Asudegi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study applies machine learning to develop empirical macroscopic emission fundamental diagrams (eMFDs) using large-scale traffic and emission data for predicting emissions and optimizing urban congestion management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address urban congestion, which worsens vehicle efficiency, greenhouse emissions, and air pollution. Macroscopic eMFDs hold promise but are rarely empirically developed due to historical data limitations.

Method: Machine learning methods are utilized to predict the relationship between network-wide emissions and traffic variables using granular data from U.S. urban areas.

Result: The study demonstrated the generation of location-dependent eMFDs and enhanced understanding of how emissions relate to traffic characteristics, infrastructure, and vehicle profiles.

Conclusion: This approach enables transportation authorities to monitor carbon emissions accurately and make informed decisions to reduce emissions and optimize traffic management at a regional scale.

Abstract: Urban congestions cause inefficient movement of vehicles and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.

TL;DR: This paper proposes two algorithms for graph coarsening based on Gromov-Wasserstein geometry with promising results on large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph coarsening is a fundamental task in graph representation and analysis, and there is a need for improved methods leveraging advanced geometry metrics like Gromov-Wasserstein.

Method: The study introduces two algorithms: Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), which iteratively merges pairs of nodes, and $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), which uses clustering for grouping nodes based on distortion.

Result: The proposed algorithms were tested on six large-scale datasets and a clustering task. They outperformed existing methods across different parameters and scenarios.

Conclusion: The authors demonstrate that their methods provide optimal graph coarsening performance and establish their effectiveness compared to existing solutions.

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

*Samuel Bilson,Maurice Cox,Anna Pustogvar,Andrew Thompson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for evaluating uncertainty in machine learning classification models, suitable for nominal properties, and highlights its applications in critical fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of defined standards and frameworks for uncertainty evaluation in ML classification models for nominal properties, limiting their applicability in crucial areas such as climate observation and medical diagnosis.

Method: The authors developed a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework utilizing probability mass functions and related statistical summaries applicable to classification models.

Result: The framework was demonstrated in two impactful applications—climate and earth observation, and medical diagnosis—highlighting its relevance and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework lays the groundwork for extending existing measurement uncertainty guides to encompass nominal properties, increasing their relevance for ML models.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) classification models are increasingly being used in a wide range of applications where it is important that predictions are accompanied by uncertainties, including in climate and earth observation, medical diagnosis and bioaerosol monitoring. The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for nominal properties. This framework is based on probability mass functions and summary statistics thereof, and it is applicable to ML classification. We also illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis. Our framework would enable an extension of the GUM to uncertainty for nominal properties, which would make both applicable to ML classification models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clear, standalone derivation of the bias-variance decomposition for prediction errors using Bregman divergence, addressing gaps in prior presentations.

Method: Provide detailed derivation and discussion, situating the decomposition within the context of maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families.

Result: Presented a pedagogical derivation of the bias-variance decomposition for Bregman divergence, consolidating and clarifying prior knowledge.

Conclusion: This paper offers an accessible and clarified version of the bias-variance decomposition for Bregman divergence, enhancing understanding in statistical and machine learning applications.

Abstract: The bias-variance decomposition is a central result in statistics and machine learning, but is typically presented only for the squared error. We present a generalization of the bias-variance decomposition where the prediction error is a Bregman divergence, which is relevant to maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families. While the result is already known, there was not previously a clear, standalone derivation, so we provide one for pedagogical purposes. A version of this note previously appeared on the author's personal website without context. Here we provide additional discussion and references to the relevant prior literature.

### [185] [FedPM: Federated Learning Using Second-order Optimization with Preconditioned Mixing of Local Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09100)
*Hiro Ishii,Kenta Niwa,Hiroshi Sawada,Akinori Fujino,Noboru Harada,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPM is a new Federated Learning method that uses second-order optimization to address issues like drift in local preconditioners, improving test accuracy and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing second-order optimization methods in Federated Learning often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, particularly in heterogeneous data setups, which impairs convergence and model accuracy.

Method: FedPM refines update rules by decomposing second-order updates into local client updates and server-based preconditioned parameter mixing, thus mitigating issues with preconditioner drift.

Result: Experiments show that FedPM achieves significantly better test accuracy than existing methods, demonstrating the benefits of leveraging second-order optimization.

Conclusion: FedPM effectively addresses preconditioner drift and enhances performance in Federated Learning, offering a theoretical and practical advancement over prior methods.

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

*Ismail Lamaakal,Chaymae Yahyati,Yassine Maleh,Khalid El Makkaoui,Ibrahim Ouahbi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BayesQ introduces an uncertainty-aware post-training quantization framework to optimize quantization results using posterior expected loss, improving performance on ResNet-50 and BERT-base benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of quantized models under tight bit constraints, addressing limitations in traditional post-training quantization approaches.

Method: BayesQ employs a Gaussian posterior for weights, designs codebooks minimizing distortion, and allocates precision via a greedy knapsack method, incorporating Monte Carlo calibration and optional distillation techniques.

Result: BayesQ achieves measurable performance gains on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) benchmarks compared to existing quantization approaches such as GPTQ.

Conclusion: BayesQ demonstrates the effectiveness of uncertainty-guided quantization, reframing quantization as risk minimization in a practical, performant pipeline.

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

*Tomoki Koike,Elizabeth Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes LyapInf, a physics-informed machine learning method to infer Lyapunov functions from trajectory data to compute stability regions without explicit system equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining stability regions for dynamical systems, especially in aerospace, is often challenging as existing methods require explicit system governing equations.

Method: The LyapInf method uses a quadratic Lyapunov function form and fits its operator to trajectory data by minimizing the Zubov equation residuals. This provides an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region.

Result: Numerical tests on benchmarks show LyapInf characterizes near-maximal stability regions successfully, solely using trajectory data.

Conclusion: LyapInf offers a novel way to compute stability regions for dynamical systems by inferring Lyapunov functions without needing explicit system equations.

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents TIGER (Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations), a method to improve multi-agent reinforcement learning by modeling and utilizing the temporal evolution of inter-agent coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL approaches generally fail to account for the temporal evolution of inter-agent interactions, which is crucial for adaptable coordination and robust policy learning.

Method: TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs for agents, capturing both current and historical interactions. A temporal attention-based encoder aggregates these interactions to develop time-aware embeddings that improve cooperative policy learning.

Result: TIGER significantly outperforms standard MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency on benchmarks focused on coordination. Ablation studies affirm the joint importance of structural and temporal modeling.

Conclusion: Capturing the temporal dynamics of inter-agent relationships is vital for enhancing MARL. TIGER demonstrates this capability effectively, contributing to more adaptable and efficient cooperative learning strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

*Xincheng Xu,Thilina Ranbaduge,Qing Wang,Thierry Rakotoarivelo,David Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DP-PMLF, a method that combines per-sample momentum and low-pass filtering to improve accuracy of DPSGD while maintaining differential privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the model accuracy degradation caused by differential privacy in DPSGD, particularly due to noise and bias introduced during training.

Method: DP-PMLF integrates per-sample momentum to smooth gradients before clipping and applies a low-pass filtering post-processing step to mitigate DP noise without using extra privacy budget.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows DP-PMLF improves convergence rate under DP guarantees, and empirical evaluations demonstrate enhanced privacy-utility trade-off compared to existing variants.

Conclusion: DP-PMLF effectively mitigates the drawbacks of DP noise and clipping bias, achieving better trade-offs between privacy and utility in training deep neural networks.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores topological descriptors for graph products, comparing Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH), and provides algorithms for PH computation with product filtrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance the use of topological descriptors in relational data by analyzing how filtrations on graph products impact expressive power and computational aspects of EC and PH.

Method: The authors analyze the expressive power of EC and PH on color-based filtrations in graph products, design algorithms for PH diagram computation for vertex and edge filtrations, and empirically validate findings.

Result: PH descriptors of graph products encode more information than individual computations, unlike EC. The paper includes runtime, expressivity analysis, and graph classification tests.

Conclusion: Graph products with product filtrations offer advanced PH-based descriptors for efficient graph analysis, outperforming EC in information encoding. Algorithms and code enhance accessibility.

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

### [191] [Rethinking Graph Super-resolution: Dual Frameworks for Topological Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08853)
*Pragya Singh,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two frameworks for graph super-resolution to address issues in existing GNN approaches and evaluates them on real-world and simulated datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing GNN-based methods for graph super-resolution and to create solutions applicable in resource-constrained fields like medicine.

Method: The authors propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks: Bi-SR for structure-aware node super-resolution and DEFEND for learning edge representations through dual graphs.

Result: The frameworks achieved state-of-the-art performance on key topological measures using a brain connectome dataset, and performed well on additional simulated datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks advance graph super-resolution by addressing scalability, expressivity, and structure-awareness, validated by real and simulated dataset benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

Method: CSTs use covariance wavelets as filters in deep untrained networks to sequentially process data and generate hierarchical representations. Computational efficiency is enhanced via pruning, and the approach is designed to be robust to finite-sample covariance estimation errors.

Result: CSTs demonstrate improved stability, handle close covariance eigenvalues better than PCA, and achieve comparable or superior results to trained models such as VNNs, particularly in low-sample settings.

Conclusion: CSTs combine the benefits of PCA and VNNs, offering a robust, training-free, and efficient tool for analyzing data with complex covariance structures, demonstrated through enhanced age prediction on neurodegenerative patient datasets.

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between mechanistic interpretability on toy models and real-world model applications, specifically in Transformer models.

Method: Improved Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) with a new causal importance function and loss function tailored for sequential data.

Result: SPD demonstrated effectiveness on a toy induction-head model and GPT-2-small, identifying interpretable mechanisms like 'golf' and 'basketball.'

Conclusion: The study provides a step forward in adapting SPD for modern models, indicating its potential for uncovering interpretable structures in parameter space.

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

*Erik Hartman,Jonas Wallin,Johan Malmström,Jimmy Olsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends Feynman-Kac steering to diffusion-based protein design for efficient, guided molecular generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advancements in diffusion-based models enabled realistic protein structure generation but lacked steering towards specific functional goals.

Method: Feynman-Kac steering is coupled with structure generation, using rewards computed on ProteinMPNN-refined models and all-atom relaxation.

Result: The method improves predicted interface energetics consistently across diverse targets with minimal computational effort.

Conclusion: Inference-time Feynman-Kac control generalizes diffusion-based protein design, enabling guided generation for arbitrary objectives.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ForeSWE is a novel model that uses deep learning and probabilistic approaches to improve Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) forecasting in snow-dominant watersheds by capturing spatio-temporal correlations and providing uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of forecasting SWE, which is spatio-temporally variable and influenced by several environmental factors, using enhanced methods that utilize spatial/temporal correlations while also providing uncertainty estimates for informed decision-making.

Method: The paper introduces ForeSWE, a probabilistic spatio-temporal model that integrates an attention mechanism for spatio-temporal interactions with a Gaussian process module to quantify prediction uncertainty.

Result: ForeSWE demonstrates significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and uncertainty estimation when tested on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The model's effectiveness in improving SWE forecasting and providing reliable uncertainty estimates can support water management decisions, offering a platform for deployment and community feedback.

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

TL;DR: This paper explores the theoretical advantages of neural networks by analyzing the training dynamics of adaptive feature programs through over-parameterized sequence models and proposes the concept of Feature Error Measure (FEM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical advantages of neural networks and analyze their learning dynamics more abstractly using the adaptive feature program.

Method: Using over-parameterized sequence models and introducing the Feature Error Measure (FEM) to evaluate and simplify the analysis of training dynamics in adaptive feature programs.

Result: The Feature Error Measure (FEM) was shown to decrease during training in various adaptive feature models like linear regression and single/multiple index models, validating the effectiveness of the adaptive feature program.

Conclusion: The decreasing trend of FEM indicates the potential success of the adaptive feature program in analyzing and understanding neural network training dynamics.

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

*Navid Mohammadi Foumani,Soheila Ghane,Nam Nguyen,Mahsa Salehi,Geoffrey I. Webb,Geoffrey Mackellar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EEG-X is a robust foundation model for EEG analysis that addresses challenges of dataset variability and low SNR, enhancing cross-domain generalization and signal noise resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges in EEG foundation models stemming from variability across datasets (devices, configurations) and low signal-to-noise ratio that obstruct the focus on brain signals over artifacts.

Method: EEG-X uses location-based channel embedding and a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy. It integrates a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer for efficient frequency- and shape-aware signal representation, enhancing noise robustness.

Result: EEG-X surpasses state-of-the-art models in EEG tasks, particularly in cross-domain scenarios with varying electrode layouts, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: EEG-X effectively generalizes across EEG datasets with varying device settings and diminishes noise sensitivity, advancing the field of EEG representation learning.

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

*Woosuk Chung,Seokwoo Hong,Wonhyeok Lee,Sangyoon Bae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage model combining per-epoch encoding with contextual features to enhance automated sleep staging accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of manual sleep staging, such as labor-intensive processes and variability, and to incorporate contextual information ignored by current deep learning models.

Method: The proposed method uses a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder and a 1D CNN aggregator, integrating contextual features including clinical metadata and expert-scored annotations.

Result: The model significantly outperforms PSG-only baselines, with macro-F1 improving from 0.7745 to 0.8031 and micro-F1 from 0.8774 to 0.9051, with event annotations providing the most improvement.

Conclusion: Incorporating clinically meaningful contextual features enhances sleep staging accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable and practical solution for improving automated systems.

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

*Oliver Wang,Pengrui Quan,Kang Yang,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces spectral predictability ($Ω$) as a simple metric to expedite time series forecasting model selection, showing its potential to predict performance across different model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting practitioners face challenges in model validation due to high computational costs, making it essential to find efficient methods for model selection.

Method: The researchers utilize spectral predictability ($Ω$) to categorize model performance across various datasets and controlled experiments, analyzing its impact on the stratification of model families.

Result: The experiments reveal that TSFMs perform better when $Ω$ values are high, while their advantage diminishes as $Ω$ decreases. The computation of $Ω$ is quick, enabling efficient differentiation between suitable and unsuitable models for the data.

Conclusion: Spectral predictability metric offers a practical way to reduce validation costs and direct attention to models capable of handling complex, low-$Ω$ problems.

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated diagnosis methods for stroke suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, contributing to healthcare disparities.

Method: FAST-CAD integrates domain-adversarial training and group distributionally robust optimization to ensure demographic-invariant representations and robust performance across subgroups.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior diagnostic accuracy and fairness across different demographic subgroups, supported by theoretical analysis of the framework's convergence and fairness guarantees.

Conclusion: FAST-CAD achieves both practical improvements in stroke diagnosis fairness and theoretical insights, marking progress in equitable medical AI systems.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weaver, an efficient and interpretable spatiotemporal forecasting model for transportation networks, improving computational costs and accuracy using novel techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in transportation network forecasting by creating a model that is accurate, interpretable, efficient, and resilient to disturbances, improving upon Transformer-based models' high computational costs and lack of interpretability.

Method: The proposed model, Weaver, applies Kronecker product approximations to decompose spatiotemporal attention into local maps, introduces Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient for improved graph generation and stability, and utilizes a Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning.

Result: Evaluations on benchmark datasets (PEMS-BAY and METR-LA) demonstrate that Weaver delivers competitive performance across different models while significantly improving training efficiency.

Conclusion: Weaver provides a breakthrough in traffic forecasting by offering an interpretable, efficient model with superior computational performance, paving the way for better handling of transportation network challenges.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIVO, a diffusion model-based approach to overcome conservatism and imbalance issues in offline reinforcement learning, achieving superior policy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Value overestimation from out-of-distribution actions in offline reinforcement learning limits policy efficiency, prompting the need for improved methods using diffusion models.

Method: DIVO uses a binary-weighted mechanism guided by advantage values for diffusion model training and dynamically filters high-return-potential actions during policy improvement, balancing conservatism and exploration.

Result: Empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that DIVO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, notably in challenging sparse reward environments like AntMaze.

Conclusion: DIVO effectively improves offline RL policies by enhancing the balance between conservatism and exploration, leading to significant performance gains across benchmarks.

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of optimizing hyperparameters for neural networks on tabular data, which suffers from non-convex search spaces and high computational costs.

Method: The proposed method, QIBONN, uses qubit-based representations to encode feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization, employing quantum-inspired rotations and qubit mutations for optimization.

Result: Experimental results on 13 real-world datasets show QIBONN's competitiveness with classical tree-based methods and other hyperparameter optimization algorithms under the same resource constraints.

Conclusion: QIBONN provides an effective quantum-inspired approach for hyperparameter optimization, demonstrating competitive performance within a fixed tuning budget and under noise conditions.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.

*Kazuki Iwahana,Yusuke Yamasaki,Akira Ito,Takayuki Miura,Toshiki Shibahara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method to counter backdoor attacks in machine learning models by reconstructing trigger-activated changes (TAC) more accurately, improving clean accuracy and backdoor suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks compromise machine learning models by making them behave maliciously on poisoned data while remaining normal on clean data. Existing defense methods struggle with precision due to inaccurate TAC estimation.

Method: The proposed method reconstructs TAC values by formulating the minimal perturbation required for misclassification as a convex quadratic optimization problem. It identifies poisoned classes through statistical analysis of $L^2$ norms of perturbations and fine-tunes backdoors using this information.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that the method achieves better backdoor suppression and higher clean accuracy than current defenses across varied attack types and architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective and precise approach for mitigating backdoor attacks in machine learning while maintaining strong clean data performance.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

Result: The enhanced CVAE approach achieved a 5% reduction in Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and a 7.7% increase in log-likelihood compared to existing methods, improving image generation.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that leveraging learnable Gaussian decoders and normalizing flows in CVAEs addresses significant generative image quality issues, offering a valid improvement over existing techniques.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

### [208] [Bayesian Mixture of Experts For Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08968)
*Maryam Dialameh,Hossein Rajabzadeh,Weiwei Zhang,Walid Ahmed,Hyock Ju Kwon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bayesian-MoE, a framework for estimating uncertainty in fine-tuned LLMs via Mixture-of-Experts architectures, improving calibration and reliability with scalable post-hoc modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often lack reliable uncertainty estimation, which is critical for decision-making. The paper addresses the need for scalable and accurate uncertainty estimates in fine-tuned LLMs.

Method: The authors propose Bayesian-MoE, using structured Laplace approximation on the second linear layer of each expert in Mixture-of-Experts architectures. They leverage Kronecker-factored approximations to enable scalable posterior estimation without modifying the training process.

Result: Bayesian-MoE demonstrated reduced expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) on benchmark tasks compared to baseline methods. This highlights its effectiveness in improving uncertainty estimation in MoE-based LLMs.

Conclusion: Bayesian-MoE is a practical approach for enhancing uncertainty estimation in fine-tuned LLMs, enabling reliable performance without additional training or parameters by leveraging existing modular expert pathways in MoE architectures.

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

### [209] [Selective Sinkhorn Routing for Improved Sparse Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08972)
*Duc Anh Nguyen,Huu Binh Ta,Nhuan Le Duc,Tan M. Nguyen,Toan Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), improving Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) by eliminating auxiliary losses for token-to-expert assignments, resulting in enhanced efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SMoE models struggle with diversity in expert utilization, reliance on computationally expensive algorithms, and the use of auxiliary losses, causing increased complexity and inefficiency.

Method: The authors formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem with constraints, deriving gating scores from the transport map and using a lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing mechanism.

Result: SSR demonstrates faster training, increased accuracy, and enhanced robustness in both language modeling and image classification tasks.

Conclusion: Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR) improves SMoE by simplifying routing mechanisms, promoting balanced token assignments, and enhancing computational efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has gained prominence as a scalable and computationally efficient architecture, enabling significant growth in model capacity without incurring additional inference costs. However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.

*Michael Nercessian,Wenxin Zhang,Alexander Schubert,Daphne Yang,Maggie Chung,Ahmed Alaa,Adam Yala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes BRIDGE, a novel randomized controlled trial (RCT) design for validating AI models by reusing historical trial data, effectively saving costs and reducing enrollment for clinical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and lengthy timelines of traditional RCTs in validating rapidly developing AI-based risk models, while maintaining rigorous clinical evidence generation.

Method: The design involves reusing participant-level data from completed AI model trials in cases of agreement between old and updated AI models. A checklist is provided to ensure valid causal inference and maintain type I error.

Result: Using datasets for breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, BRIDGE showed significant overlap between successive AI models, reducing required trial enrollment by 46.6% and saving over $2.8 million in breast cancer screening simulations.

Conclusion: The BRIDGE design supports adaptive, cost-effective RCTs for iterative AI model validation, accelerating their clinical translation while maintaining robust evidence generation.

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds by embedding it into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space using the $p$-Fréchet map, resulting in faster computation and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges of existing intrinsic methods for clustering on high-dimensional and non-Euclidean manifolds, and improve efficiency and accuracy especially in complex scenarios.

Method: Utilize the $p$-Fréchet map to embed manifold data into lower-dimensional Euclidean space, enabling the use of standard clustering techniques like k-means.

Result: Demonstrates up to two orders of magnitude runtime improvement and high clustering accuracy on both synthetic and real high-dimensional data, outperforming intrinsic manifold-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is computationally efficient and accurate for clustering on manifolds, especially effective in scenarios where existing methods fail.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in autonomous driving but face challenges like high computation and privacy concerns within distributed environments.

Method: FLAD incorporates a cloud-edge-vehicle architecture, optimized communication scheduling, and knowledge distillation to allow collaborative training of LLMs on distributed multimodal sensory data.

Result: FLAD improves autonomous driving model training efficiency, data privacy, and resource utilization, as demonstrated through tests on NVIDIA Jetsons.

Conclusion: FLAD highlights potential advancements for collaborative training of autonomous driving models while addressing implementation challenges and optimizing performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of federated learning caused by data distribution differences through a causal inference method called FedSDWC, which enhances generalization and out-of-distribution detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome reliability issues in federated learning caused by covariate and semantic shifts in data distribution.

Method: The authors propose FedSDWC, a method that integrates invariant and variant features using causal inference to construct causal semantic representations.

Result: FedSDWC's generalization error bound is theoretically derived, and experiments on benchmark datasets show its superior performance, outperforming FedICON by 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: FedSDWC improves federated learning's capability to generalize and detect OOD data in real-world cases affected by distribution shifts, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

TL;DR: This paper addresses semantic drift in graph neural network aggregation for text-attributed graphs by introducing Geodesic Aggregation and GeoGNN to preserve manifold structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address semantic drift caused by linear aggregation mechanisms in graph neural networks for text-attributed graphs, ultimately improving semantic fidelity and expressive power.

Method: This work introduces Geodesic Aggregation, leveraging geodesics via log-exp mappings on the unit sphere, and develops GeoGNN with spherical attention and manifold interpolation.

Result: GeoGNN mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines across benchmark datasets with improved text-attributed graph learning.

Conclusion: Manifold-aware aggregation mechanisms, such as GeoGNN, are crucial for maintaining semantic fidelity and enhancing performance in text-attributed graph learning.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for preference elicitation rely heavily on parametric reward models, which are prone to inaccuracies when feedback is sparse. A new approach is needed to ensure efficiency and robustness in sparse feedback settings.

Method: The authors propose using feedback augmentation to enhance model-free dueling bandit frameworks. They integrate augmented confidence bounds and analyze trade-offs through regret analysis.

Result: The prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across diverse IPE benchmarks, including recommendation systems, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of a feedback-augmented model-free approach to interactive preference elicitation, paving the way for broader applications.

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

*Anthony Baez,Wang Zhang,Ziwen Ma,Lam Nguyen,Subhro Das,Luca Daniel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PINN-Proj, a projection method to ensure physical law conservation in Physics-Informed Neural Networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs, using soft constraints, can fail to conserve integral physical quantities, leading to violations of physical laws.

Method: Projection formulae derived from constrained non-linear optimization aim to ensure conservation of linear and quadratic integrals in PINNs.

Result: PINN-Proj achieves 3-4 orders of magnitude improved conservation accuracy, with slight PDE solution error reduction and better convergence.

Conclusion: PINN-Proj is a robust general framework for guaranteeing integral conservation in PINNs where feasible solutions are available.

Abstract: We propose a novel projection method that guarantees the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve the flexibility and accuracy of clustering categorical attributes by learning customized category relationships rather than relying on fixed ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of fixed category relationships in clustering categorical attributes, which hinder adaptability to various cluster structures and reduce clustering accuracy.

Method: The method learns customized category relationships compatible with Euclidean distance metrics, allowing for better adaptation to different cluster structures and integration with mixed numerical-categorical datasets.

Result: Experiments on 12 benchmark datasets demonstrated an improvement in clustering accuracy, with the proposed method achieving an average ranking of 1.25 compared to 5.21 of the best current method.

Conclusion: The method enhances the clustering algorithm's fitting ability through learnable category relationships and proves highly effective in achieving superior clustering results across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of VLM-generated labels, such as noise and lack of error correction, by introducing a mechanism to enhance label quality efficiently.

Method: HCL selectively applies human correction to instances where VLM predictions show discrepancies. A risk-consistent estimator and conditional probability method enhance label distribution estimation using VLM outputs and model predictions.

Result: Experiments show the method improves classification performance, is robust against label noise, and reduces annotation labor costs.

Conclusion: HCL effectively combines human correction and machine learning techniques to enhance label quality, with significant implications for weak supervision scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

*Ziwei Li,Shuzi Niu,Tao Yuan,Huiyuan Li,Wenjia Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reduce fill-ins in LU factorization for large sparse matrices by learning a reordering function that minimizes the \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimizing fill-ins during LU factorization is crucial for reducing memory and computational costs in large sparse matrices. Existing approaches have limitations as minimizing fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives lack theoretical guarantees.

Method: The method uses a graph encoder-based reordering network that predicts row or column node scores to derive a permutation. Two reparameterization techniques and a factorization process are integrated into the optimization for more accurate objective alignment.

Result: This approach achieved a 20% reduction in fill-ins and a 17.8% reduction in LU factorization time on the SuiteSparse benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces fill-ins and computational time in sparse matrix LU factorization, outperforming existing techniques with a theoretically informed approach.

Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: The paper studies label-flipping data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment in large language models, investigating their theoretical foundations and proposing methods to minimize attack costs while preserving effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models play critical roles in real-world applications, but their vulnerability to data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment demands in-depth theoretical analysis to ensure their robustness.

Method: The authors formulate the minimum-cost data poisoning attack as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints and derive bounds on attack cost. They also propose a post-processing approach to reduce the number of label flips in existing attacks.

Result: Empirical results show that the proposed post-processing method significantly reduces poisoning costs, especially when the feature dimension of the reward model is small compared to the dataset size.

Conclusion: The research identifies theoretical vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provides tools to evaluate and mitigate the impact of low-cost poisoning attacks, enhancing understanding and robustness of LLM systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that TERLA enhances the efficiency, performance, and scalability of reinforcement learning agents in defending networks with varying characteristics, indicating practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored problem of class imbalance in multi-view contexts, with a focus on trustworthy solutions for long-tailed classification.

Method: The paper proposes TMLC, a framework featuring group consensus for opinion aggregation inspired by Social Identity Theory, alongside a novel uncertainty-guided pseudo-data generation mechanism with a new distance metric adapted from SMOTE.

Result: Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that TMLC outperforms existing methods in classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed TMLC framework effectively addresses long-tailed classification in multi-view scenarios, showcasing the feasibility and superiority of the approach.

Abstract: Class imbalance has been extensively studied in single-view scenarios; however, addressing this challenge in multi-view contexts remains an open problem, with even scarcer research focusing on trustworthy solutions. In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving superior performance. The code is released at https://github.com/cncq-tang/TMLC.

*Junyi Liu,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a chaining-based framework to estimate uncertainty bounds in Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), improving robustness and addressing limitations of prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for uncertainty bounds in GPR rely on posterior estimates, hyperparameter tuning, or specific input features, but these methods lack robustness and global consistency.

Method: The authors develop a chaining-based framework for estimating bounds on expected extreme values without requiring specific input access, with kernel-specific refinements and numerical tightness improvements.

Result: The experimental results validate theoretical claims, showing improved performance over existing methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework provides tighter and more robust uncertainty bounds for GPR, both globally and locally, and enhances its application in safety-critical scenarios.

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Zhuoyun Du,Runze Wang,Huiyu Bai,Zouying Cao,Xiaoyong Zhu,Bo Zheng,Wei Chen,Haochao Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper suggests a new paradigm for direct communication between LLM agents using latent states, which enhances collaboration and problem-solving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitation of natural language communication in LLM-based agents, as it constrains the depth and nuance of transmitted information during collaborative tasks.

Method: The paper introduces Interlat, a paradigm using the last hidden states of LLMs as communication representations with an additional latent space compression system.

Result: Experiments show Interlat surpasses fine-tuned CoT prompting and single-agent methods, fostering deeper exploration, faster inference, and efficient handling of information.

Conclusion: Interlat proves the feasibility of using latent space for inter-agent communication, showcasing its potential for optimizing collaboration and reasoning in future systems.

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

### [226] [Unsupervised Feature Selection Through Group Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09166)
*Shira Lifshitz,Ofir Lindenbaum,Gal Mishne,Ron Meir,Hadas Benisty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GroupFS is a novel unsupervised feature selection method that identifies and selects groups of related features without predefined partitions or label supervision, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised feature selection methods focus on individual features, ignoring the fact that related features often work together to provide informative insights. Current methods relying on predefined feature groupings or label supervision are limiting.

Method: GroupFS employs an end-to-end differentiable framework to discover latent feature groups and select the most informative among them. It uses Laplacian smoothness for both feature and sample graphs, alongside a group sparsity regularizer.

Result: GroupFS demonstrated superior performance over nine datasets (images, tabular, and biological data) for unsupervised feature selection, enhancing clustering and identifying meaningful feature group patterns.

Conclusion: GroupFS advances unsupervised FS by effectively targeting group structure without requiring predefined or supervised labels, offering better generalization across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

*Yohan Jung,Hyungi Lee,Wenlong Chen,Thomas Möllenhoff,Yingzhen Li,Juho Lee,Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors propose a novel method for building compact memory in logistic regression to address catastrophic forgetting, achieving significant improvements in accuracy for continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between continual learning and batch training performance, emphasizing the development of compact memory to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The method involves formulating optimal memory search as Hessian-matching and using probabilistic PCA to estimate it.

Result: The proposed method outperforms Experience Replay, achieving 60% accuracy with 0.3% memory size and 74% accuracy with 2% memory size on Split-ImageNet, closely approaching batch accuracy of 77.6%.

Conclusion: The study showcases a promising approach to developing compact memory for continual learning, offering potential for broader applications in deep learning.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, continual learning still does not match the performance of batch training. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task. Our work opens a new direction for building compact memory that can also be useful in the future for continual deep learning.

### [228] [Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer for Stable Cross-Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09173)
*Guojian Wang,Quinson Hon,Xuyang Chen,Lin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DFDT, a new data fusion method to improve decision transformers (DTs) under cross-domain shifts, emphasizing enhanced data alignment and token continuity for better adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods that struggle with poor stitchability, RTG continuity, and performance under domain shifts.

Method: DFDT utilizes a two-level data filter with maximum mean discrepancy mismatch and optimal transport deviation to align data and trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. It also replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens and employs a Q-guided regularizer to prevent policy inconsistencies.

Result: DFDT outperforms offline reinforcement learning baselines across multiple domain shifts such as gravity, kinematic, and morphology changes in D4RL-style control tasks. The improvements include better return stability and enhanced token-sequence semantics.

Conclusion: DFDT successfully addresses key challenges of cross-domain shifts by improving data stitching, semantic token continuity, and overall policy performance, providing theoretical guarantees of performance based on alignment measures.

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

### [229] [FSampler: Training Free Acceleration of Diffusion Sampling via Epsilon Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09180)
*Michael A. Vladimir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSampler is a tool to improve sampling efficiency in diffusion models by minimizing function evaluations and maintaining high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the inefficiency of traditional diffusion samplers that require numerous function evaluations, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.

Method: FSampler uses a training-free mechanism, leveraging a short history of denoising signals to predict future steps with finite difference predictors. It validates and stabilizes predictions, includes drift corrections, and introduces protective mechanisms like periodic anchors to bound trajectory deviations.

Result: FSampler integrates seamlessly with various sampling methods (e.g., Euler/DDIM) and reduces computational overhead. Tests on specific models showed time savings of 8-22% and a 15-25% reduction in model calls at high fidelity, with up to 50% saved at lower fidelity.

Conclusion: FSampler offers an effective, sampler-agnostic solution to enhance the efficiency of diffusion samplers while maintaining high output quality, providing significant time and computational savings without altering existing sampling formulas.

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in detecting AI-generated text by improving the quality of benchmark datasets, focusing on cleansing DetectRL to remove exploitable patterns and mitigate spoofing attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to prevent the misuse of large language models (LLMs) by developing effective detectors for AI-generated text, which require high-quality benchmark datasets for training and evaluation.

Method: The authors identified exploitable patterns in the DetectRL dataset and applied data cleansing operations to eliminate these shortcomings.

Result: Cleansed datasets were shown to make direct spoofing attacks more difficult, improving the robustness of detectors trained on the new dataset.

Conclusion: Enhancing dataset quality through cleansing better prepares AI detection systems to resist spoofing attacks. The reprocessed dataset is made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: We present a stochastic version of the mean-shift clustering algorithm. In this stochastic version a randomly chosen sequence of data points move according to partial gradient ascent steps of the objective function. Theoretical results illustrating the convergence of the proposed approach, and its relative performances is evaluated on synthesized 2-dimensional samples generated by a Gaussian mixture distribution and compared with state-of-the-art methods. It can be observed that in most cases the stochastic mean-shift clustering outperforms the standard mean-shift. We also illustrate as a practical application the use of the presented method for speaker clustering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoCo-MILP, a framework improving the prediction of solutions for MILP problems by addressing misalignments in existing GNN-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving large-scale MILP instances is computationally challenging, and existing GNN approaches fail to align with MILP's intrinsic structural properties.

Method: It combines an Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss with an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer to better capture variable priorities and competitive relationships.

Result: CoCo-MILP achieves a solution gap reduction of up to 68.12% on benchmarks compared to traditional solvers.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively advances learning-based MILP solution prediction, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCMax, a fully parameter-free clustering framework addressing hyperparameter reliance in clustering methods. SCMax combines hierarchical clustering with self-supervised consensus scoring to determine optimal cluster numbers, achieving superior performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering methods depend heavily on hyperparameters like the number of clusters, limiting their real-world applicability. The motivation is to create a parameter-free and adaptive solution for clustering.

Method: SCMax integrates hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single process. It uses a self-supervised task to improve data representation at each agglomeration step and employs a consensus score based on nearest neighbors to identify the optimal number of clusters.

Result: Experiments across various datasets show SCMax surpassing existing clustering techniques, particularly in scenarios with an unknown cluster count.

Conclusion: SCMax provides a novel parameter-free clustering framework leveraging consensus maximization, offering better clustering results without relying on sensitive hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PlanB&B, a model-based reinforcement learning approach for improving variable selection in mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) branch-and-bound algorithms. It achieves superior outcomes over previous RL methods across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional hand-crafted heuristics used in branch-and-bound solvers for MILP problems and explore reinforcement learning to tailor branching strategies for specific problem distributions.

Method: The study proposes PlanB&B, a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that uses a learned internal model of B&B dynamics to devise better branching strategies, combining RL advancements in board games with Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Result: Computational experiments demonstrate that PlanB&B outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Conclusion: PlanB&B represents a successful integration of model-based reinforcement learning with MILP solvers, showing potential to optimize branching strategies and extend RL achievements into combinatorial optimization domains beyond board games.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&B). A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a distributed GNN-based framework to solve scalability and accuracy issues in combinatorial optimization problems on large graphs using subgraph partitioning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph neural network methods face scalability and accuracy issues when addressing combinatorial optimization, especially on large and complex graphs.

Method: The framework partitions large graphs into smaller subgraphs for independent training, then applies reinforcement learning to ensure relationships between nodes are learned.

Result: Experiments on real-world and synthetic large-scale graphs show improved solution quality, efficiency, and scalability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework allows GNNs to scale effectively while maintaining accuracy and is validated in large-scale graph scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a threat model targeting both utility and fairness in federated learning, and counters it with GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework to maintain accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces vulnerabilities from adversarial behaviors compromising utility and fairness, with limited strategies addressing simultaneous degradation of both.

Method: The paper proposes the Dual-Facet Attack (S-DFA and Sp-DFA) to demonstrate the threat to both predictive accuracy and fairness, and introduces GuardFed, using fairness-aware reference models and dual-perspective trust scores for defense.

Result: Experiments show existing defenses fail against DFAs, whereas GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: GuardFed represents a state-of-the-art solution for robust federated learning defense against concurrent threats to utility and fairness.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

*Helena Monke,Benjamin Fresz,Marco Bernreuther,Yilin Chen,Marco F. Huber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RENTT, a method to transform neural networks into exact equivalent decision trees, addressing issues like faithfulness and computational scalability in explainable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are powerful but hindered by their opacity and black-box nature, causing trust issues. Explainable AI methods exist but often fail in faithfulness and scalability, particularly for large or complex networks.

Method: The authors present RENTT, an algorithm to transform neural networks, including CNNs and RNNs, into exact multivariate decision trees. These trees provide feature importance calculations (global, regional, and local) with theoretical proofs and computational efficiency.

Result: Experiments showed RENTT's computational efficiency and scalability while outperforming approximation methods like LIME and SHAP in producing faithful ground truth explanations.

Conclusion: RENTT is a novel method for generating faithful and computationally efficient explainable models for neural networks, improving scalability and exactness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Tensor Circuit Neural Network (TCNN) that outperforms existing methods by achieving superior generalization, robustness, and efficiency with low complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications.

Method: The proposed TCNN leverages tensor neural networks combined with residual circuit models, an innovative activation operation in the complex number field, and an information fusion layer to effectively improve feature learning, generalization, and robustness.

Result: Compared to state-of-the-art models, TCNN demonstrates an average accuracy improvement of 2%-3% across datasets, better performance under noise attack scenarios, and similar performance in terms of trainable parameters and CPU running time.

Conclusion: The TCNN achieves superior generalization ability and robustness, even in adverse conditions, while maintaining low complexity, supported by an ablation study confirming its architectural advantages.

Abstract: It is challenging to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications. Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\%-3\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.

*Tong Wu,Yutong He,Bin Wang,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies activation memory bottlenecks in large language models (LLMs) and introduces Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel architecture that reduces memory usage while preserving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address memory overhead challenges in LLMs, particularly focusing on activation memory arising from feed-forward networks during training and inference.

Method: The paper introduces Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), which activates only the Top-K relevant channels per token using SwiGLU's gating mechanism to reduce activation memory.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that MoC reduces activation memory, enhances inference efficiency, and achieves throughput gains without compromising performance.

Conclusion: MoC presents an effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem in LLMs, balancing memory efficiency and model performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

*Mohsen Amiri,Konstantin Avrachenkov,Ibtihal El Mimouni,Sindri Magnússon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MARBLE, a model that enhances Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) by addressing nonstationary environments through latent Markov states. It proposes theoretical and empirical findings showing the model's effectiveness in dynamic decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of classical RMABs, which assume fixed dynamics, making them unsuitable for changing environments. This aim is to create a framework that handles nonstationarity in evolving decision-making scenarios.

Method: The authors develop MARBLE, a framework that integrates latent Markov states into RMABs, enabling them to model nonstationary environments. A novel Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion is introduced, and synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) is proposed. They prove theoretical convergence of the method and validate it using a calibrated simulator.

Result: The theoretical results show that QWI under the MAI criterion converges to the optimal Q-function, even with unobserved regime switches. Empirical validation demonstrates that QWI adapts effectively to shifting latent states and outperforms in a recommender system.

Conclusion: MARBLE offers a robust extension of RMABs for nonstationary environments, supported by theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence. The findings validate MARBLE as an effective approach for adaptive and optimal decision-making in dynamic contexts.

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

*Xinpeng Li,Kai Ming Ting*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution in AI models, proposes a new method called DFAX, and demonstrates its superiority over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and opacity of black-box AI models have created a demand for reliable techniques to explain their decisions. Existing feature attribution methods lack a formal definition and fall short in capturing the data distribution effectively.

Method: The authors provide a formal definition of feature attribution and present DFAX, a novel, model-agnostic method that explains classifier predictions using the underlying data distribution.

Result: DFAX outperforms state-of-the-art feature attribution methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, as evidenced by results from extensive experiments.

Conclusion: This paper formalizes the feature attribution problem, highlights the shortcomings of existing methods, and introduces DFAX as a superior solution that uses the data distribution to explain model decisions.

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WOODELF, a Python package for efficiently computing SHAP values using a novel algorithm, achieving significant speed improvements on CPU and GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of existing SHAP computation methods, particularly on large datasets, and integrate game theory and Boolean logic to enhance interpretability in decision tree ensembles.

Method: WOODELF creates a pseudo-Boolean formula capturing feature values, tree structures, and entire background datasets to compute SHAP values efficiently. It uses NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy for implementation.

Result: WOODELF achieved substantial speedups, computing Background SHAP values on a large dataset in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU, outperforming existing methods by a wide margin.

Conclusion: WOODELF offers a highly efficient, scalable, and hardware-agnostic solution for SHAP computations, enabling practical large-scale applications in various domains.

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

TL;DR: Proposes using conditional diffusion models to address undersampled PET imaging caused by gaps in detector layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of undersampled sinograms due to unconstrained PET detector layouts in real-world designs.

Method: Employs conditional diffusion models as a generative approach to interpolate missing PET sinogram data.

Result: Enables recovery of missing lines-of-response, allowing for efficient and flexible PET scanner designs.

Conclusion: Conditional diffusion models can enhance PET imaging, supporting innovative, cost-efficient, patient-friendly geometries.

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CREAT, a novel attack on sequential recommenders using constrained reinforcement learning for effective and stealthy profile pollution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the practicality and stealthiness of adversarial attacks on sequential recommenders, addressing limitations like detectable shifts and coarse perturbations.

Method: The paper introduces the CREAT framework, utilizing bi-level optimization, multi-reward reinforcement learning, and constrained group-step perturbations to achieve targeted mispredictions with minimal detectability.

Result: Experiments show the effectiveness of CREAT, achieving targeted pollution while maintaining high stealthiness and evasiveness in recommendation systems.

Conclusion: CREAT provides a sophisticated method to exploit vulnerabilities in sequential recommenders, improving adversarial efficacy while reducing detection risks.

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

TL;DR: AdaCuRL is a novel adaptive curriculum RL framework addressing challenges in LLM reasoning training, such as Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation. It dynamically matches data difficulty to model capability while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for training LLMs face issues with mixed difficulty samples and challenges in curriculum learning, including manual designs and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The paper introduces AdaCuRL, a framework combining coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation, adaptive curriculum scheduling, data revisitation, adaptive referencing, and sparse KL strategies.

Result: AdaCuRL improves reasoning tasks in LLMs and MLLMs across diverse benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: AdaCuRL presents a robust solution to enhance RL training for LLMs by dynamically aligning training processes, preventing policy degradation, and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

*Philip Sosnin,Matthew Wicker,Josh Collyer,Calvin Tsay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a framework to certify model robustness against training data perturbations, including data poisoning, unlearning, and differential privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Certifying models against training data perturbations is a less explored area compared to inference-time adversarial robustness, though critical in contexts like poisoning attacks, unlearning, and privacy guarantees.

Method: The authors propose AGT, a unified framework that bounds reachable parameter sets through provable parameter-space analysis for models trained with first-order optimization.

Result: AGT formalizes robustness analysis for diverse training data perturbations and provides provable parameter-space bounds.

Conclusion: The work highlights AGT as a robust approach to certify resilience of models in the face of varying training data reliability scenarios.

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CallosumNet, a framework for efficient unlearning in spatio-temporal graphs, achieving complete unlearning with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for complete and efficient unlearning in spatio-temporal graphs has emerged due to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), as existing unlearning methods are costly and inefficient in this context.

Method: CallosumNet employs two innovative techniques: Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC) for localized subgraph creation and Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB) to reconstruct global spatio-temporal dependencies.

Result: CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CallosumNet provides an efficient and effective solution to the challenge of spatio-temporal graph unlearning, supporting privacy compliance with minimal performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

*Jiao Chen,Weihua Li,Jianhua Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a retain-free unlearning framework for IIoT environments named Probing then Editing (PTE), which focuses on efficient knowledge editing without relying on whole datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial IIoT environments require a mechanism for models to selectively forget outdated or erroneous data without relying on retain data, which conflicts with computational and privacy constraints.

Method: The framework, PTE, probes the decision boundary for the data to be forgotten and optimizes a push-pull strategy. Push dismantles the target's decision region, while pull anchors retained class knowledge using masked knowledge distillation.

Result: Experiments show that PTE achieves an effective balance between the ability to unlearn and preserving model utility in benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: PTE provides an efficient retain-free unlearning mechanism suitable for IIoT scenarios while maintaining the balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAEs face challenges when applied to scientific data with group symmetries beyond language models, needing adaptations to maintain their effectiveness.

Method: The authors introduce adaptively equivariant SAEs that utilize group symmetries, training on synthetic images to improve feature extraction and probing performance.

Result: Adaptive SAEs with incorporated symmetries demonstrate superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs on tasks involving scientific data.

Conclusion: Integrating group symmetries into SAEs enhances their utility for mechanistic interpretability in non-language domains, making them more effective in downstream applications.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for effective graph machine learning in scenarios with sparse data, personalization requirements, and privacy constraints, which current methods often struggle to fully address.

Method: The proposed approach utilizes data augmentation, prompt tuning, and in-context learning to enhance graph tasks. It incorporates Dynamic UMAP for personalized graph embeddings and a Bayesian variational framework to enable federated learning.

Result: The method supports low-resource tasks like node classification and link prediction, aligns language model representations with graph structures, and demonstrates applications in knowledge graphs, recommendation systems, and citation/product graphs.

Conclusion: The study presents a comprehensive methodology for integrating large language models with graph machine learning, ensuring personalization and privacy. It emphasizes evaluation standards while addressing convergence and privacy modeling.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Motivation: With urbanization causing traffic congestion, the study aims to improve traffic forecasting strategies through ITS, using statistical, ML, and DL methods.

Method: The study compares various traffic forecasting models on data from California's Harbor Freeway, evaluating their performance across 20 forecasting windows using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-Square.

Result: ANFIS-GP performed best for short-term with RMSE of 0.038, while Bi-LSTM showed robustness and superior results for medium-term (20 forecasting with RMSE of 0.1863). Bi-LSTM demonstrated higher robustness indicated by lower slope in performance degradation.

Conclusion: Hybrid models combining ML/DL and statistical methods hold potential for enhancing traffic forecasting accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Method: The authors propose a framework combining global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model interpretability.

Result: The framework was validated on 341 SEP events across solar cycles 22-24 and demonstrated improved insights in a case study on major SEP events.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances explainability and enables better physics-informed understanding of SEP event predictions.

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

*Andrew Hamara,Greg Hamerly,Pablo Rivas,Andrew C. Freeman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SOLIS, which reduces planning in complex decision-making to simple vector operations within a learned embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to simplify planning in high-dimensional decision spaces by proposing an alternative method to traditional dynamics models or policy training.

Method: The authors employ supervised contrastive learning to create an evaluation-aligned embedding space, where outcome similarity is represented by proximity and a global advantage vector guides decision-making.

Result: Their method, SOLIS, is demonstrated in chess, where it achieves competitive strength through shallow search techniques in the learned space.

Conclusion: Evaluation-aligned latent planning, as demonstrated by SOLIS, provides a lightweight alternative to more complex planning methods, showing potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

### [255] [PDAC: Efficient Coreset Selection for Continual Learning via Probability Density Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09487)
*Junqi Gao,Zhichang Guo,Dazhi Zhang,Yao Li,Yi Ran,Biqing Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a more efficient method for coreset construction in rehearsal-based continual learning by proposing the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method, leveraging probability density for sample selection and improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and high computational cost of current coreset selection methods in rehearsal-based continual learning and improve the quality of selected samples.

Method: Analyze the contribution of samples through MSE error decomposition, develop PDAC using a Projected Gaussian Mixture model for density-based selection, and implement SPDAC with streaming Expectation Maximization for adaptability.

Result: The proposed PDAC and SPDAC methods demonstrate superior performance in continual learning tasks compared to existing baselines, providing both effectiveness in knowledge retention and efficiency.

Conclusion: PDAC and SPDAC enhance rehearsal-based continual learning by prioritizing high-density samples for buffer construction, achieving better computational efficiency and training efficacy.

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoSynth is a framework for generating datasets and optimizing workflows for specialized LLM tasks without manual labeled data, enabling efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for scalable, cost-effective data generation for fine-tuning large language models, particularly in subjective and open-ended tasks where labeled datasets are difficult and expensive to curate.

Method: AutoSynth uses a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel hybrid reward system without relying on existing labeled datasets. It employs two LLM-as-judge components to dynamically evaluate sample quality and workflow effectiveness.

Result: In experiments with subjective educational tasks, AutoSynth-generated workflows show significant improvements over baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and can match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, with a dramatic reduction in human effort.

Conclusion: AutoSynth effectively addresses the cold start problem and introduces a scalable and automated solution for dataset and workflow generation for subjective LLM tasks, making the process more efficient and accessible.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an advanced reinforcement learning framework that utilizes second-order optimization techniques for faster convergence and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address slow convergence in first-order methods and utilize curvature information for better optimization in deterministic actor-critic algorithms.

Method: The paper extends deterministic policy gradient methods by introducing a quadratic critic that approximates both the true policy gradient and performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning mechanism estimates critic parameters, enabling quasi-Newton actor updates.

Result: Numerical examples substantiate improved convergence speed and better performance as compared to standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed second-order deterministic actor-critic framework is a significant enhancement applicable to differentiable policy classes, effectively improving optimization and learning efficiency in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenePheno introduces an interpretable prediction framework for determining knockout-induced phenotypic abnormalities directly from gene sequences, addressing scalability and generalizability issues in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between genetic sequences and phenotypes by creating a scalable and generalizable approach for predicting multiple phenotype abnormalities directly from gene sequences.

Method: The study proposes GenePheno, a multi-label prediction framework using contrastive learning, exclusive regularization for biological consistency, and a gene function bottleneck layer for interpretability.

Result: GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art performance on curated datasets and effectively reveals gene functional mechanisms through case studies.

Conclusion: GenePheno provides an innovative and interpretable solution for phenotype prediction, advancing scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation in genetic studies.

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high latency and power consumption challenges in machine learning model inference due to extensive arithmetic computations.

Method: A digital-time-domain approach using delay accumulation and a Winner-Takes-All scheme, coupled with Hamming distance-based and logarithmic delay compression methods for TMs.

Result: The proposed architecture offers orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput compared to a baseline digital TM architecture.

Conclusion: The approach effectively optimizes Tsetlin machine inference, providing a resource-efficient and high-performance solution for machine learning models.

Abstract: Machine learning fits model parameters to approximate input-output mappings, predicting unknown samples. However, these models often require extensive arithmetic computations during inference, increasing latency and power consumption. This paper proposes a digital-time-domain computing approach for Tsetlin machine (TM) inference process to address these challenges. This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput.

*Samyak Sanghvi,Nishant Ranjan,Tarak Karmakar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SiDGen is a scalable, protein-structure-informed computational tool for designing chemically-valid, pocket-compatible ligands efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck in computational drug discovery of designing ligands that are both chemically and structurally compatible with protein binding pockets, overcoming limitations of current methods.

Method: SiDGen employs a protein-conditioned diffusion approach integrating masked SMILES with lightweight folding-derived features, providing scalability and two conditioning pathways for structural context.

Result: SiDGen achieves high ligand validity, uniqueness, novelty, and competitive docking performance while saving memory and computational resources.

Conclusion: SiDGen facilitates scalable, structure-informed ligand generation, enhancing high-throughput drug discovery with practical efficiency and expressivity.

Abstract: Designing ligands that are both chemically valid and structurally compatible with protein binding pockets is a key bottleneck in computational drug discovery. Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Negative Space Learning for Machine Translation (NSL-MT), a method that penalizes models for generating linguistically invalid outputs to improve translation quality, especially in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in machine translation when limited parallel annotated data is available, and to improve translation quality while reducing data requirements.

Method: NSL-MT encodes linguistic constraints as severity-weighted penalties in the loss function and introduces synthetic violations of grammar to teach models what not to generate.

Result: NSL-MT significantly boosts BLEU scores (3-12% for strong models, 56-89% for weaker models) and improves data efficiency by enabling effective training with fewer examples.

Conclusion: NSL-MT offers a data-efficient, effective method of training MT models under low-resource conditions, improving translation quality through penalization of invalid structures.

Abstract: We introduce Negative Space Learning MT (NSL-MT), a training method that teaches models what not to generate by encoding linguistic constraints as severity-weighted penalties in the loss function. NSL-MT increases limited parallel data with synthetically generated violations of target language grammar, explicitly penalizing the model when it assigns high probability to these linguistically invalid outputs. We demonstrate that NSL-MT delivers improvements across all architectures: 3-12\% BLEU gains for well-performing models and 56-89\% gains for models lacking descent initial support. Furthermore, NSL-MT provides a 5x data efficiency multiplier -- training with 1,000 examples matches or exceeds normal training with 5,000 examples. Thus, NSL-MT provides a data-efficient alternative training method for settings where there is limited annotated parallel corporas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of temporal covariate shift and unstable gradient flow in Spiking Neural Networks, which hinder their performance in AI applications.

Method: The authors propose MP-Init, aligning initial membrane potential with stationary distribution, and TrSG, stabilizing gradient flow concerning the threshold voltage during the training of SNNs.

Result: The proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art accuracy across static and dynamic image datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of the innovations.

Conclusion: The paper's innovations significantly enhance the training and performance of SNNs, contributing to the development of energy-efficient AI paradigms, and the code is made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the direct training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated high-quality outputs even at early timesteps, paving the way for novel energy-efficient AI paradigms. However, the inherent non-linearity and temporal dependencies in SNNs introduce persistent challenges, such as temporal covariate shift (TCS) and unstable gradient flow with learnable neuron thresholds. In this paper, we present two key innovations: MP-Init (Membrane Potential Initialization) and TrSG (Threshold-robust Surrogate Gradient). MP-Init addresses TCS by aligning the initial membrane potential with its stationary distribution, while TrSG stabilizes gradient flow with respect to threshold voltage during training. Extensive experiments validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on both static and dynamic image datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/kookhh0827/SNN-MP-Init-TRSG

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper introduces PANDA, a framework that accurately identifies antagonistic jobs causing performance interference in datacenters by leveraging global historical knowledge and a new contention metric, achieving better results than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of performance interference in warehouse-scale datacenters caused by antagonistic jobs overconsuming shared resources, which existing methods fail to handle efficiently, especially under noisy and multi-victim scenarios.

Method: The method employs a novel framework, PANDA, that uses cycles per instruction (CPI) as a performance metric, integrates global historical knowledge to suppress measurement noise, and introduces a machine-level CPI metric to detect contention among multiple co-located tasks.

Result: PANDA was evaluated on a Google production trace, improving the accuracy of antagonist ranking from 50-55% to 82.6% and maintaining consistent performance under multi-victim scenarios with minimal runtime overhead.

Conclusion: PANDA significantly advances antagonist identification in datacenters by outperforming existing approaches in accuracy and noise-resilience, facilitating better resource management in production-scale environments.

Abstract: Modern warehouse-scale datacenters commonly collocate multiple jobs on shared machines to improve resource utilization. However, such collocation often leads to performance interference caused by antagonistic jobs that overconsume shared resources. Existing antagonist-detection approaches either rely on offline profiling, which is costly and unscalable, or use a sample-from-production approach, which suffers from noisy measurements and fails under multi-victim scenarios. We present PANDA, a noise-resilient antagonist identification framework for production-scale datacenters. Like prior correlation-based methods, PANDA uses cycles per instruction (CPI) as its performance metric, but it differs by (i) leveraging global historical knowledge across all machines to suppress sampling noise and (ii) introducing a machine-level CPI metric that captures shared-resource contention among multiple co-located tasks. Evaluation on a recent Google production trace shows that PANDA ranks true antagonists far more accurately than prior methods -- improving average suspicion percentile from 50-55% to 82.6% -- and achieves consistent antagonist identification under multi-victim scenarios, all with negligible runtime overhead.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Soteria, a functional-style library for developing symbolic execution (SE) engines directly tailored to source languages like Rust and C, outperforming existing alternatives in performance and bug detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of using intermediate languages (ILs) in SE tools, which lead to trade-offs in performance, accuracy, and proper support for specific language features.

Method: The authors propose Soteria, a functional-style OCaml library that allows developers to construct SE engines directly based on source-language semantics, achieving configurability, compositional reasoning, and simplicity.

Result: The developed SE engines, Soteria^Rust and Soteria^C, handle Rust’s Tree Borrows model and C respectively. They achieve competitive or superior performance and bug detection compared to leading tools like Kani and CBMC.

Conclusion: Building SE engines directly for source languages, rather than relying on ILs, is a more efficient and effective approach, and Soteria exemplifies this with strong theoretical foundations and practical success.

Abstract: Symbolic execution (SE) tools often rely on intermediate languages (ILs) to support multiple programming languages, promising reusability and efficiency. In practice, this approach introduces trade-offs between performance, accuracy, and language feature support. We argue that building SE engines \emph{directly} for each source language is both simpler and more effective. We present Soteria, a lightweight OCaml library for writing SE engines in a functional style, without compromising on performance, accuracy or feature support. Soteria enables developers to construct SE engines that operate directly over source-language semantics, offering \emph{configurability}, compositional reasoning, and ease of implementation. Using Soteria, we develop Soteria$^{\text{Rust}}$, the \emph{first} Rust SE engine supporting Tree Borrows (the intricate aliasing model of Rust), and Soteria$^{\text{C}}$, a compositional SE engine for C. Both tools are competitive with or outperform state-of-the-art tools such as Kani, Pulse, CBMC and Gillian-C in performance and the number of bugs detected. We formalise the theoretical foundations of Soteria and prove its soundness, demonstrating that sound, efficient, accurate, and expressive SE can be achieved without the compromises of ILs.

Motivation: To draw a connection between Galois slicing, a technique initially designed for explaining program executions, and differentiable programming, to expand its theoretical framework and apply it to quantitative interval analysis.

Method: Galois slicing is reformulated using the CHAD approach to automatic differentiation and presented via categorical semantics for a structured exploration.

Result: The reformulation helps extend Galois slicing to quantitative interval analysis and clarifies decisions in previous implementations.

Conclusion: Using categorical semantics enriches the theoretical understanding of Galois slicing, facilitating new applications and deepening the analytical framework.

Abstract: Galois slicing is a technique for program slicing for provenance, developed by Perera and collaborators. Galois slicing aims to explain program executions by demonstrating how to track approximations of the input and output forwards and backwards along a particular execution. In this paper, we explore an analogy between Galois slicing and differentiable programming, seeing the implementation of forwards and backwards slicing as a kind of automatic differentiation. Using the CHAD approach to automatic differentiation due to Vákár and collaborators, we reformulate Galois slicing via a categorical semantics. In doing so, we are able to explore extensions of the Galois slicing idea to quantitative interval analysis, and to clarify the implicit choices made in existing instantiations of this approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph estimation methods face scalability issues with large and long-term applications, necessitating more efficient approaches.

Method: The authors enhance the MAC algorithm by introducing a specialized solver, optimizing step size strategies, and developing automatic connectivity-preserving schemes.

Result: The improvements deliver a 2x speedup in runtime, faster convergence, better solution quality, and eliminate the need for manual edge specification.

Conclusion: The proposed advancements render MAC more efficient, scalable, and practical for real-time long-term state estimation scenarios.

Abstract: Long-term state estimation over graphs remains challenging as current graph estimation methods scale poorly on large, long-term graphs. To address this, our work advances a current state-of-the-art graph sparsification algorithm, maximizing algebraic connectivity (MAC). MAC is a sparsification method that preserves estimation performance by maximizing the algebraic connectivity, a spectral graph property that is directly connected to the estimation error. Unfortunately, MAC remains computationally prohibitive for online use and requires users to manually pre-specify a connectivity-preserving edge set. Our contributions close these gaps along three complementary fronts: we develop a specialized solver for algebraic connectivity that yields an average 2x runtime speedup; we investigate advanced step size strategies for MAC's optimization procedure to enhance both convergence speed and solution quality; and we propose automatic schemes that guarantee graph connectivity without requiring manual specification of edges. Together, these contributions make MAC more scalable, reliable, and suitable for real-time estimation applications.

Motivation: To unlock the full potential of robots in human-populated environments, it is crucial to enable synergistic collaboration where humans and robots can interact and share information effectively.

Method: The authors analyze the interaction pipeline from translating multimodal human inputs to robot-understandable representations, adaptive planning, role allocation, and control-feedback mechanisms.

Result: The paper identifies key components that facilitate intuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration and highlights promising directions for future advancements.

Conclusion: Effective human-robot collaboration requires continuous communication and adaptation to intuitively share instructions, expertise, and states between humans and robots, making HRC more seamless and accessible.

Abstract: Remarkable capabilities have been achieved by robotics and AI, mastering complex tasks and environments. Yet, humans often remain passive observers, fascinated but uncertain how to engage. Robots, in turn, cannot reach their full potential in human-populated environments without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting their behavior. To achieve a synergistic human-robot collaboration (HRC), a continuous information flow should be established: humans must intuitively communicate instructions, share expertise, and express needs. In parallel, robots must clearly convey their internal state and forthcoming actions to keep users informed, comfortable, and in control. This review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots. We examine the full interaction pipeline: from the human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs into robot-understandable representations, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to the control layer and feedback mechanisms to close the loop. Finally, we highlight trends and promising directions toward more adaptive, accessible HRC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure system safety when using learned perception modules, which are often prone to failure when faced with OoD measurements due to epistemic uncertainty.

Method: Introduces ATOM-CBF, an approach with two components: (1) an adaptive perception error margin sensitive to OoD data and (2) a safety filter integrating this margin, ensuring adaptability and safety in real-time.

Result: The framework was empirically validated, showing safety maintenance on an F1Tenth vehicle (LiDAR scans) and a quadruped robot (RGB images) during simulations.

Conclusion: ATOM-CBF effectively adapts to epistemic uncertainty from OoD measurements, ensuring system safety without requiring additional ground-truth labels or distribution shift details.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of real-world systems is challenging, especially when they rely on learned perception modules to infer the system state from high-dimensional sensor data. These perception modules are vulnerable to epistemic uncertainty, often failing when encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) measurements not seen during training. To address this gap, we introduce ATOM-CBF (Adaptive-To-OoD-Measurement Control Barrier Function), a novel safe control framework that explicitly computes and adapts to the epistemic uncertainty from OoD measurements, without the need for ground-truth labels or information on distribution shifts. Our approach features two key components: (1) an OoD-aware adaptive perception error margin and (2) a safety filter that integrates this adaptive error margin, enabling the filter to adjust its conservatism in real-time. We provide empirical validation in simulations, demonstrating that ATOM-CBF maintains safety for an F1Tenth vehicle with LiDAR scans and a quadruped robot with RGB images.

Method: CENIC integrates advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration to create a continuous-time simulator capable of handling stiff dynamics efficiently.

Result: CENIC is able to achieve real-time simulation speeds comparable to existing discrete-time simulators while maintaining guarantees on accuracy and convergence.

Conclusion: CENIC proves to be a highly efficient and accurate continuous-time simulator, merging the advantages of continuous integration and discrete time-stepping, suitable for modern robotics workflows.

Abstract: State-of-the-art robotics simulators operate in discrete time. This requires users to choose a time step, which is both critical and challenging: large steps can produce non-physical artifacts, while small steps force the simulation to run slowly. Continuous-time error-controlled integration avoids such issues by automatically adjusting the time step to achieve a desired accuracy. But existing error-controlled integrators struggle with the stiff dynamics of contact, and cannot meet the speed and scalability requirements of modern robotics workflows. We introduce CENIC, a new continuous-time integrator that brings together recent advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration, inheriting benefits from both continuous integration and discrete time-stepping. CENIC runs at fast real-time rates comparable to discrete-time robotics simulators like MuJoCo, Drake and Isaac Sim, while also providing guarantees on accuracy and convergence.

*Richard Cheng,Peter Werner,Carolyn Matl*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a motion planning method for dual-arm robots, focusing on reducing high-dimensional complexity using shared joints' structure, achieving rapid planning and high success rates in real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time motion planning for dual-arm robots is challenging in unknown, dynamic environments because of their high-dimensional configuration space and complex collision constraints.

Method: The authors construct dynamic roadmaps for each kinematic chain of dual-arm robots, exploiting structural links due to shared torso joints to optimize search efficiency and reduce dimensionality.

Result: Experiments on a 19 DoF robot in a grocery store showed a 0.4s average planning time with a 99.9% success rate in over 2000 motion plans.

Conclusion: Utilizing shared joint structures as proposed significantly enhances motion planning efficiency and reliability for high-degree-of-freedom dual-arm robots in real-world settings.

Abstract: High degree-of-freedom dual-arm robots are becoming increasingly common due to their morphology enabling them to operate effectively in human environments. However, motion planning in real-time within unknown, changing environments remains a challenge for such robots due to the high dimensionality of the configuration space and the complex collision-avoidance constraints that must be obeyed. In this work, we propose a novel way to alleviate the curse of dimensionality by leveraging the structure imposed by shared joints (e.g. torso joints) in a dual-arm robot. First, we build two dynamic roadmaps (DRM) for each kinematic chain (i.e. left arm + torso, right arm + torso) with specific structure induced by the shared joints. Then, we show that we can leverage this structure to efficiently search through the composition of the two roadmaps and largely sidestep the curse of dimensionality. Finally, we run several experiments in a real-world grocery store with this motion planner on a 19 DoF mobile manipulation robot executing a grocery fulfillment task, achieving 0.4s average planning times with 99.9% success rate across more than 2000 motion plans.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances human-robot collaboration by leveraging planning-level intention prediction and simulation-based training, yielding both safety and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: In mobile robot shared control, effectively understanding human motion intention is critical for seamless human-robot collaboration. This paper presents a novel shared control framework featuring planning-level intention prediction. A path replanning algorithm is designed to adjust the robot's desired trajectory according to inferred human intentions. To represent future motion intentions, we introduce the concept of an intention domain, which serves as a constraint for path replanning. The intention-domain prediction and path replanning problems are jointly formulated as a Markov Decision Process and solved through deep reinforcement learning. In addition, a Voronoi-based human trajectory generation algorithm is developed, allowing the model to be trained entirely in simulation without human participation or demonstration data. Extensive simulations and real-world user studies demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces operator workload and enhances safety, without compromising task efficiency compared with existing assistive teleoperation approaches.

*Ningnan Wang,Weihuang Chen,Liming Chen,Haoxuan Ji,Zhongyu Guo,Xuchong Zhang,Hongbin Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCOPE, a zero-shot framework for embodied visual navigation that emphasizes frontier boundaries and exploration potential to enhance decision quality and long-horizon planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of integration of visual frontier boundaries and effective inference between partial observations and navigation goals in existing methods motivates the development of SCOPE.

Method: SCOPE employs a Vision-Language Model to assess exploration potential, organizes it into a spatio-temporal graph, and introduces a self-reconsideration mechanism to improve reliability and prevent overconfidence.

Result: SCOPE delivers a 4.6% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in embodied navigation tasks, showing better calibration, generalization, and decision quality.

Conclusion: By leveraging frontier information and dynamic exploration strategies, SCOPE advances embodied navigation, outperforming current approaches and demonstrating its effectiveness across tasks.

Abstract: Embodied visual navigation remains a challenging task, as agents must explore unknown environments with limited knowledge. Existing zero-shot studies have shown that incorporating memory mechanisms to support goal-directed behavior can improve long-horizon planning performance. However, they overlook visual frontier boundaries, which fundamentally dictate future trajectories and observations, and fall short of inferring the relationship between partial visual observations and navigation goals. In this paper, we propose Semantic Cognition Over Potential-based Exploration (SCOPE), a zero-shot framework that explicitly leverages frontier information to drive potential-based exploration, enabling more informed and goal-relevant decisions. SCOPE estimates exploration potential with a Vision-Language Model and organizes it into a spatio-temporal potential graph, capturing boundary dynamics to support long-horizon planning. In addition, SCOPE incorporates a self-reconsideration mechanism that revisits and refines prior decisions, enhancing reliability and reducing overconfident errors. Experimental results on two diverse embodied navigation tasks show that SCOPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 4.6\% in accuracy. Further analysis demonstrates that its core components lead to improved calibration, stronger generalization, and higher decision quality.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that effectively integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as active, high-level planners in robotic navigation tasks, significantly improving navigation efficiency using structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic navigation methods do not fully exploit the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This paper aims to shift VLMs from passive observers to active planners, enhancing their role in robotics.

Method: The framework leverages VLMs for high-level planning via frontier-based exploration using techniques like chain-of-thought prompting for logical reasoning, integration of recent action history to prevent loops, and spatial reasoning by interpreting top-down obstacle maps alongside first-person views.

Result: Testing on benchmarks such as HM3D, Gibson, and MP3D demonstrates significantly more efficient and direct navigation trajectories compared to existing methodologies.

Conclusion: This novel integration of VLMs as strategic planners in robotic navigation leads to improved efficiency and marks a step towards more capable embodied agents.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are set to transform robotic navigation, existing methods often underutilize their reasoning capabilities. To unlock the full potential of VLMs in robotics, we shift their role from passive observers to active strategists in the navigation process. Our framework outsources high-level planning to a VLM, which leverages its contextual understanding to guide a frontier-based exploration agent. This intelligent guidance is achieved through a trio of techniques: structured chain-of-thought prompting that elicits logical, step-by-step reasoning; dynamic inclusion of the agent's recent action history to prevent getting stuck in loops; and a novel capability that enables the VLM to interpret top-down obstacle maps alongside first-person views, thereby enhancing spatial awareness. When tested on challenging benchmarks like HM3D, Gibson, and MP3D, this method produces exceptionally direct and logical trajectories, marking a substantial improvement in navigation efficiency over existing approaches and charting a path toward more capable embodied agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited perception and decision-making in standalone autonomous driving systems by introducing a cooperative multi-agent framework integrated across perception, prediction, and planning.

Method: The framework employs a novel multi-level fusion strategy, unifying perception and prediction tasks, and incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to improve BEV representations and enhance decoder capabilities for diverse motion patterns.

Result: UniMM-V2X significantly improves autonomous driving performance on the DAIR-V2X dataset, with 39.7% better perception accuracy, 7.2% less prediction error, and 33.2% improved planning compared to UniV2X.

Conclusion: The proposed MoE-enhanced multi-level cooperative paradigm demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in advancing autonomous driving through hierarchical cooperation across core tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous driving holds transformative potential but remains fundamentally constrained by the limited perception and isolated decision-making with standalone intelligence. While recent multi-agent approaches introduce cooperation, they often focus merely on perception-level tasks, overlooking the alignment with downstream planning and control, or fall short in leveraging the full capacity of the recent emerging end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present UniMM-V2X, a novel end-to-end multi-agent framework that enables hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning. At the core of our framework is a multi-level fusion strategy that unifies perception and prediction cooperation, allowing agents to share queries and reason cooperatively for consistent and safe decision-making. To adapt to diverse downstream tasks and further enhance the quality of multi-level fusion, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to dynamically enhance the BEV representations. We further extend MoE into the decoder to better capture diverse motion patterns. Extensive experiments on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 39.7% improvement in perception accuracy, a 7.2% reduction in prediction error, and a 33.2% improvement in planning performance compared with UniV2X, showcasing the strength of our MoE-enhanced multi-level cooperative paradigm.

Motivation: Address the challenges of premature convergence and limited solution diversity in traditional metaheuristic algorithms applied to UAV path planning.

Method: Proposed the Enhanced Multi-Strategy Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (EDMO), integrating DQTOS for local optima escape, BDFSS for adaptive refinement, and OLOBL for enhanced global exploration.

Result: EDMO outperformed 14 advanced algorithms in benchmarks like CEC2017 and CEC2020 and demonstrated practical efficacy in UAV trajectory planning and engineering tasks.

Conclusion: EDMO proves to be effective in solving complex UAV path planning problems, showcasing adaptability, robustness, and optimization accuracy.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), effective path planning has become increasingly important. Although traditional search methods have been extensively applied, metaheuristic algorithms have gained popularity due to their efficiency and problem-specific heuristics. However, challenges such as premature convergence and lack of solution diversity still hinder their performance in complex scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Enhanced Multi-Strategy Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (EDMO) algorithm, tailored for three-dimensional UAV trajectory planning in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. EDMO integrates three novel strategies: (1) a Dynamic Quantum Tunneling Optimization Strategy (DQTOS) to enable particles to probabilistically escape local optima; (2) a Bio-phototactic Dynamic Focusing Search Strategy (BDFSS) inspired by microbial phototaxis for adaptive local refinement; and (3) an Orthogonal Lens Opposition-Based Learning (OLOBL) strategy to enhance global exploration through structured dimensional recombination. EDMO is benchmarked on 39 standard test functions from CEC2017 and CEC2020, outperforming 14 advanced algorithms in convergence speed, robustness, and optimization accuracy. Furthermore, real-world validations on UAV three-dimensional path planning and three engineering design tasks confirm its practical applicability and effectiveness in field robotics missions requiring intelligent, adaptive, and time-efficient planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for VO and VIO are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications on resource-constrained devices due to their reliance on absolute camera pose estimation and extensive map optimization.

Method: The proposed SMF-VO employs a 'motion-centric' framework, estimating motion directly from sparse optical flow without explicit pose estimation. It uses a 3D ray-based motion field formulation suitable for various camera models.

Result: The approach achieves superior efficiency and competitive accuracy, running over 100 FPS on a Raspberry Pi 5 using only a CPU, as demonstrated on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SMF-VO offers a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional visual odometry, making it particularly well-suited for mobile robotics and wearable devices.

Abstract: Traditional Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) methods rely on a 'pose-centric' paradigm, which computes absolute camera poses from the local map thus requires large-scale landmark maintenance and continuous map optimization. This approach is computationally expensive, limiting their real-time performance on resource-constrained devices. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sparse Motion Field Visual Odometry (SMF-VO), a lightweight, 'motion-centric' framework. Our approach directly estimates instantaneous linear and angular velocity from sparse optical flow, bypassing the need for explicit pose estimation or expensive landmark tracking. We also employed a generalized 3D ray-based motion field formulation that works accurately with various camera models, including wide-field-of-view lenses. SMF-VO demonstrates superior efficiency and competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets, achieving over 100 FPS on a Raspberry Pi 5 using only a CPU. Our work establishes a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional methods, making it highly suitable for mobile robotics and wearable devices.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have achieved significant advances, and full autonomy within defined operational design domains near practical deployment. Expanding these domains requires addressing safety assurance under diverse conditions. Information sharing through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, enabled by a Dynamic Map platform built from vehicle and roadside sensor data, offers a promising solution. Real-world experiments with numerous infrastructure sensors incur high costs and regulatory challenges. Conventional single-host simulators lack the capacity for large-scale urban traffic scenarios. This paper proposes D-AWSIM, a distributed simulator that partitions its workload across multiple machines to support the simulation of extensive sensor deployment and dense traffic environments. A Dynamic Map generation framework on D-AWSIM enables researchers to explore information-sharing strategies without relying on physical testbeds. The evaluation shows that D-AWSIM increases throughput for vehicle count and LiDAR sensor processing substantially compared to a single-machine setup.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address limitations in existing motion tracking methods for legged robots, such as reliance on reference data during deployment and the need for extensive parameter tuning, which hinders adaptability and efficiency.

Method: APEX integrates expert demonstrations into reinforcement learning using decaying action priors to bias exploration initially toward demonstrations, combined with a multi-critic framework to balance task performance and motion style.

Result: APEX demonstrates improved sample efficiency, style transfer across terrains, robustness to reward variations, and enables a single policy to handle diverse motions. Experiments validate its effectiveness both in simulations and on a Unitree Go2 robot.

Conclusion: APEX provides an efficient, adaptable, and robust method for learning locomotion in legged robots, advancing reinforcement learning with guidance-driven exploration and generalization across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Learning natural, animal-like locomotion from demonstrations has become a core paradigm in legged robotics. Despite the recent advancements in motion tracking, most existing methods demand extensive tuning and rely on reference data during deployment, limiting adaptability. We present APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient Exploration), a plug-and-play extension to state-of-the-art motion tracking algorithms that eliminates any dependence on reference data during deployment, improves sample efficiency, and reduces parameter tuning effort. APEX integrates expert demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL) by incorporating decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is combined with a multi-critic framework that balances task performance with motion style. Moreover, APEX enables a single policy to learn diverse motions and transfer reference-like styles across different terrains and velocities, while remaining robust to variations in reward design. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments in both simulation and on a Unitree Go2 robot. By leveraging demonstrations to guide exploration during RL training, without imposing explicit bias toward them, APEX enables legged robots to learn with greater stability, efficiency, and generalization. We believe this approach paves the way for guidance-driven RL to boost natural skill acquisition in a wide array of robotic tasks, from locomotion to manipulation.

*Amirhossein Kazemipour,Robert K. Katzschmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for real-time, independent control of torque and stiffness in soft actuators, ensuring stability and adaptability during contact interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining independent torque-stiffness control in artificial muscles during dynamic contact scenarios, enabling better human-robot interaction and adaptive control.

Method: The paper develops a unified force law for modeling various soft actuator types and a cascaded controller with analytical inverse dynamics to achieve independent modulation of torque and stiffness.

Result: The framework demonstrates significant improvements in handling contact disturbances with faster settling on soft surfaces, reduced force on rigid surfaces, and increased stability compared to fixed policies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework supports musculoskeletal antagonistic systems in executing adaptive impedance control, advancing the safety and performance of human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Antagonistic soft actuators built from artificial muscles (PAMs, HASELs, DEAs) promise plant-level torque-stiffness decoupling, yet existing controllers for soft muscles struggle to maintain independent control through dynamic contact transients. We present a unified framework enabling independent torque and stiffness commands in real-time for diverse soft actuator types. Our unified force law captures diverse soft muscle physics in a single model with sub-ms computation, while our cascaded controller with analytical inverse dynamics maintains decoupling despite model errors and disturbances. Using co-contraction/bias coordinates, the controller independently modulates torque via bias and stiffness via co-contraction-replicating biological impedance strategies. Simulation-based validation through contact experiments demonstrates maintained independence: 200x faster settling on soft surfaces, 81% force reduction on rigid surfaces, and stable interaction vs 22-54% stability for fixed policies. This framework provides a foundation for enabling musculoskeletal antagonistic systems to execute adaptive impedance control for safe human-robot interaction.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces tools to measure diversity and learnability in embodied intelligence datasets, overcoming limitations in current evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the difficulty of comprehensively evaluating the diversity and learnability of embodied intelligence datasets due to their multimodal nature.

Method: Two tools are proposed: a diversity entropy measure for multimodal dataset diversity, and an interpretable algorithm to quantify dataset learnability without requiring training.

Result: The approach is validated on simulated and real-world datasets, showing that the tools provide actionable insights for improving dataset diversity and learnability.

Conclusion: The work lays the groundwork for creating higher-quality datasets that enhance the progress of embodied intelligence research.

Abstract: In embodied intelligence, datasets play a pivotal role, serving as both a knowledge repository and a conduit for information transfer. The two most critical attributes of a dataset are the amount of information it provides and how easily this information can be learned by models. However, the multimodal nature of embodied data makes evaluating these properties particularly challenging. Prior work has largely focused on diversity, typically counting tasks and scenes or evaluating isolated modalities, which fails to provide a comprehensive picture of dataset diversity. On the other hand, the learnability of datasets has received little attention and is usually assessed post-hoc through model training, an expensive, time-consuming process that also lacks interpretability, offering little guidance on how to improve a dataset. In this work, we address both challenges by introducing two principled, data-driven tools. First, we construct a unified multimodal representation for each data sample and, based on it, propose diversity entropy, a continuous measure that characterizes the amount of information contained in a dataset. Second, we introduce the first interpretable, data-driven algorithm to efficiently quantify dataset learnability without training, enabling researchers to assess a dataset's learnability immediately upon its release. We validate our algorithm on both simulated and real-world embodied datasets, demonstrating that it yields faithful, actionable insights that enable researchers to jointly improve diversity and learnability. We hope this work provides a foundation for designing higher-quality datasets that advance the development of embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the RGMP framework to address inefficiencies in humanoid robots' multimodal control and visuomotor generalization using geometric-semantic reasoning and recursive Gaussian-based motion modeling, achieving notable improvements in task success and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid robot approaches rely heavily on data-driven methods requiring extensive datasets, often neglecting geometric reasoning and inefficiently modeling robot-target relationships, raising training inefficiency concerns.

Method: The RGMP framework integrates geometric-semantic skill reasoning with data-efficient visuomotor control. It includes a Geometric-prior Skill Selector for adaptive skill sequence generation and an Adaptive Recursive Gaussian Network for compact hierarchy modeling of robot-object interactions.

Result: The RGMP framework achieved 87% task success in generalization tests and demonstrated 5x greater data efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: RGMP effectively improves cross-domain generalization and data efficiency for humanoid and robotic systems by incorporating geometric-semantic reasoning and recursive Gaussian process adaptation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots exhibit significant potential in executing diverse human-level skills. However, current research predominantly relies on data-driven approaches that necessitate extensive training datasets to achieve robust multimodal decision-making capabilities and generalizable visuomotor control. These methods raise concerns due to the neglect of geometric reasoning in unseen scenarios and the inefficient modeling of robot-target relationships within the training data, resulting in significant waste of training resources. To address these limitations, we present the Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy (RGMP), an end-to-end framework that unifies geometric-semantic skill reasoning with data-efficient visuomotor control. For perception capabilities, we propose the Geometric-prior Skill Selector, which infuses geometric inductive biases into a vision language model, producing adaptive skill sequences for unseen scenes with minimal spatial common sense tuning. To achieve data-efficient robotic motion synthesis, we introduce the Adaptive Recursive Gaussian Network, which parameterizes robot-object interactions as a compact hierarchy of Gaussian processes that recursively encode multi-scale spatial relationships, yielding dexterous, data-efficient motion synthesis even from sparse demonstrations. Evaluated on both our humanoid robot and desktop dual-arm robot, the RGMP framework achieves 87% task success in generalization tests and exhibits 5x greater data efficiency than the state-of-the-art model. This performance underscores its superior cross-domain generalization, enabled by geometric-semantic reasoning and recursive-Gaussion adaptation.

*Eungchang Mason Lee,Kevin Christiansen Marsim,Hyun Myung*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces LODESTAR, a LiDAR-inertial odometry method for overcoming degeneracies in challenging environments via degeneracy-aware modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges presented by degenerate environments (e.g., long corridors, high-altitude flights) that degrade the performance of LiDAR-inertial odometry due to imbalanced or sparse measurements.

Method: LODESTAR utilizes two novel modules: the degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filter (DA-ASKF), which adapts state estimation based on degeneracy levels, and degeneracy-aware data exploitation (DA-DE), which selectively uses measurements to improve localization.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that LODESTAR achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing LiDAR-based odometry methods, especially in degenerate conditions.

Conclusion: LODESTAR effectively addresses degeneracies in LiDAR-inertial odometry, making it reliable for robotics applications in challenging environments.

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) has been widely used in robotics due to its high accuracy. However, its performance degrades in degenerate environments, such as long corridors and high-altitude flights, where LiDAR measurements are imbalanced or sparse, leading to ill-posed state estimation. In this letter, we present LODESTAR, a novel LIO method that addresses these degeneracies through two key modules: degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filter (DA-ASKF) and degeneracy-aware data exploitation (DA-DE). DA-ASKF employs a sliding window to utilize past states and measurements as additional constraints. Specifically, it introduces degeneracy-aware sliding modes that adaptively classify states as active or fixed based on their degeneracy level. Using Schmidt-Kalman update, it partially optimizes active states while preserving fixed states. These fixed states influence the update of active states via their covariances, serving as reference anchors--akin to a lodestar. Additionally, DA-DE prunes less-informative measurements from active states and selectively exploits measurements from fixed states, based on their localizability contribution and the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. Consequently, DA-ASKF enables degeneracy-aware constrained optimization and mitigates measurement sparsity, while DA-DE addresses measurement imbalance. Experimental results show that LODESTAR outperforms existing LiDAR-based odometry methods and degeneracy-aware modules in terms of accuracy and robustness under various degenerate conditions.

*Yuxi Wei,Zirui Wang,Kangning Yin,Yue Hu,Jingbo Wang,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses scalable learning for humanoid robots using human motion videos, introducing a pipeline to create a dataset (Humanoid-Union) and proposing SCHUR framework for effective use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human motion videos are rich in data and semantic meanings, representing an untapped potential to address the data bottleneck in humanoid robot learning.

Method: Develop an autonomous pipeline to transform human motion videos into a dataset (Humanoid-Union) and create the SCHUR framework for scalable learning in the context of text-motion alignment and high-level robot control.

Result: SCHUR achieved significant improvements in robot motion accuracy (37% MPJPE reduction) and alignment quality (25% FID improvement) over prior methods. It also showed effectiveness in real-world robot applications.

Conclusion: The use of large-scale human video-based data, coupled with advanced learning frameworks, unlocks improved control and semantic alignment for humanoid robots.

Abstract: Data scaling has long remained a critical bottleneck in robot learning. For humanoid robots, human videos and motion data are abundant and widely available, offering a free and large-scale data source. Besides, the semantics related to the motions enable modality alignment and high-level robot control learning. However, how to effectively mine raw video, extract robot-learnable representations, and leverage them for scalable learning remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-Union, a large-scale dataset generated through an autonomous pipeline, comprising over 260 hours of diverse, high-quality humanoid robot motion data with semantic annotations derived from human motion videos. The dataset can be further expanded via the same pipeline. Building on this data resource, we propose SCHUR, a scalable learning framework designed to explore the impact of large-scale data on high-level control in humanoid robots. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHUR achieves high robot motion generation quality and strong text-motion alignment under data and model scaling, with 37\% reconstruction improvement under MPJPE and 25\% alignment improvement under FID comparing with previous methods. Its effectiveness is further validated through deployment in real-world humanoid robot.

### [287] [UMIGen: A Unified Framework for Egocentric Point Cloud Generation and Cross-Embodiment Robotic Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09302)
*Yan Huang,Shoujie Li,Xingting Li,Wenbo Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces UMIGen, a framework addressing challenges in robotic learning by enabling robust data collection using a handheld device and efficient optimization for egocentric observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust policies in robotic learning need large-scale, high-quality data, but traditional methods are hindered by high costs, specialized hardware, and limited spatial generalization.

Method: UMIGen integrates two components: Cloud-UMI for handheld data collection of 3D observations and a visibility-aware optimization mechanism for generating field-of-view-specific observations.

Result: UMIGen demonstrates effective cross-embodiment generalization and improves data collection efficiency in diverse manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: UMIGen overcomes hardware restrictions and enhances 3D data generation, enabling better robotic policy transferability and data collection efficiency across embodiments.

Abstract: Data-driven robotic learning faces an obvious dilemma: robust policies demand large-scale, high-quality demonstration data, yet collecting such data remains a major challenge owing to high operational costs, dependence on specialized hardware, and the limited spatial generalization capability of current methods. The Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) relaxes the strict hardware requirements for data collection, but it is restricted to capturing only RGB images of a scene and omits the 3D geometric information on which many tasks rely. Inspired by DemoGen, we propose UMIGen, a unified framework that consists of two key components: (1) Cloud-UMI, a handheld data collection device that requires no visual SLAM and simultaneously records point cloud observation-action pairs; and (2) a visibility-aware optimization mechanism that extends the DemoGen pipeline to egocentric 3D observations by generating only points within the camera's field of view. These two components enable efficient data generation that aligns with real egocentric observations and can be directly transferred across different robot embodiments without any post-processing. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that UMIGen supports strong cross-embodiment generalization and accelerates data collection in diverse manipulation tasks.

*Stepan Dergachev,Artem Pshenitsyn,Aleksandr Panov,Alexey Skrynnik,Konstantin Yakovlev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoRL-MPPI, a novel method that fuses Cooperative Reinforcement Learning with Model Predictive Path Integral for improved multi-robot collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable multi-robot systems face challenges in decentralized collision avoidance, and existing MPPI approaches suffer from limitations due to uninformed random sampling.

Method: CoRL-MPPI integrates a pretrained action policy (via Cooperative Reinforcement Learning) into MPPI's sampling, leveraging deep neural networks to guide intelligent decisions while maintaining MPPI's theoretical guarantees.

Result: Simulation experiments in dynamic, dense environments show that CoRL-MPPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as ORCA, BVC, and multi-agent MPPI in terms of navigation efficiency and safety.

Conclusion: CoRL-MPPI effectively enhances multi-robot navigation by improving collision avoidance performance and robustness while retaining theoretical benefits of MPPI.

Abstract: Decentralized collision avoidance remains a core challenge for scalable multi-robot systems. One of the promising approaches to tackle this problem is Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) -- a framework that is naturally suited to handle any robot motion model and provides strong theoretical guarantees. Still, in practice MPPI-based controller may provide suboptimal trajectories as its performance relies heavily on uninformed random sampling. In this work, we introduce CoRL-MPPI, a novel fusion of Cooperative Reinforcement Learning and MPPI to address this limitation. We train an action policy (approximated as deep neural network) in simulation that learns local cooperative collision avoidance behaviors. This learned policy is then embedded into the MPPI framework to guide its sampling distribution, biasing it towards more intelligent and cooperative actions. Notably, CoRL-MPPI preserves all the theoretical guarantees of regular MPPI. We evaluate our approach in dense, dynamic simulation environments against state-of-the-art baselines, including ORCA, BVC, and a multi-agent MPPI implementation. Our results demonstrate that CoRL-MPPI significantly improves navigation efficiency (measured by success rate and makespan) and safety, enabling agile and robust multi-robot navigation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPIDER is a physics-informed framework to convert human motion data into robot trajectories, addressing data scarcity in humanoid and dexterous hand control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid and dexterous hand policy learning needs extensive motion data; collecting robot-specific data is costly. Human motion capture can address this but lacks necessary dynamic information.

Method: SPIDER uses physics-based sampling to transform kinematic human demonstrations into robot trajectories while refining feasibilities and contact sequences via virtual guidance.

Result: The framework demonstrates scalability across 9 robot types and 6 datasets, improving success rates by 18% and being 10 times faster than traditional RL methods.

Conclusion: SPIDER provides an efficient, scalable method for converting human motion data into robot training data, enabling diverse data generation for effective policy learning.

Abstract: Learning dexterous and agile policy for humanoid and dexterous hand control requires large-scale demonstrations, but collecting robot-specific data is prohibitively expensive. In contrast, abundant human motion data is readily available from motion capture, videos, and virtual reality, which could help address the data scarcity problem. However, due to the embodiment gap and missing dynamic information like force and torque, these demonstrations cannot be directly executed on robots. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalable Physics-Informed DExterous Retargeting (SPIDER), a physics-based retargeting framework to transform and augment kinematic-only human demonstrations to dynamically feasible robot trajectories at scale. Our key insight is that human demonstrations should provide global task structure and objective, while large-scale physics-based sampling with curriculum-style virtual contact guidance should refine trajectories to ensure dynamical feasibility and correct contact sequences. SPIDER scales across diverse 9 humanoid/dexterous hand embodiments and 6 datasets, improving success rates by 18% compared to standard sampling, while being 10X faster than reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, and enabling the generation of a 2.4M frames dynamic-feasible robot dataset for policy learning. As a universal physics-based retargeting method, SPIDER can work with diverse quality data and generate diverse and high-quality data to enable efficient policy learning with methods like RL.

*Fangqi Zhu,Zhengyang Yan,Zicong Hong,Quanxin Shou,Xiao Ma,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces WMPO, a framework for Vision-Language-Action-based reinforcement learning that eliminates the need for real-world interactions by using pixel-aligned world models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models struggle with learning from failures and self-corrections due to their dependence on expert demonstrations, while reinforcement learning in robotics is hindered by high sample complexity.

Method: The authors propose WMPO, utilizing pixel-based predictions with VLA features for reinforcement learning without real-world environment interactions, and employ policy optimization through GRPO for enhanced performance.

Result: WMPO significantly increases sample efficiency, achieves better performance, facilitates emergent behaviors like self-correction, and ensures robust generalization and lifelong learning in both simulated and real-robot environments.

Conclusion: WMPO provides a viable and effective alternative for scalable on-policy reinforcement learning in robotics, resulting in improved learning efficiency and robotic capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation, but their reliance on expert demonstrations limits their ability to learn from failures and perform self-corrections. Reinforcement learning (RL) addresses these through self-improving interactions with the physical environment, but suffers from high sample complexity on real robots. We introduce World-Model-based Policy Optimization (WMPO), a principled framework for on-policy VLA RL without interacting with the real environment. In contrast to widely used latent world models, WMPO focuses on pixel-based predictions that align the "imagined" trajectories with the VLA features pretrained with web-scale images. Crucially, WMPO enables the policy to perform on-policy GRPO that provides stronger performance than the often-used off-policy methods. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-robot settings demonstrate that WMPO (i) substantially improves sample efficiency, (ii) achieves stronger overall performance, (iii) exhibits emergent behaviors such as self-correction, and (iv) demonstrates robust generalization and lifelong learning capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAP-VLA, a memory-augmented framework that enhances Vision-Language-Action models to handle long-horizon robotic tasks by integrating demonstration-based memory prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained VLA models struggle with long-horizon tasks as they lack memory and only rely on immediate sensory inputs.

Method: The proposed MAP-VLA constructs a memory library from task demonstrations, uses learnable soft prompts via prompt tuning for memory optimization, and retrieves relevant memory through trajectory matching during task execution to guide the VLA model.

Result: MAP-VLA achieves up to 7.0% improvements in simulation benchmarks and 25.0% in real robot evaluations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods for long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: This framework provides a lightweight, plug-and-play solution to enhance pre-trained VLA models for long-horizon robotic manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements and flexibility.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in improving robustness and generalization for end-to-end robotic manipulation. However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SpatialActor is a robust framework enhancing robotic manipulation by decoupling semantics and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art performance under noisy and diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods in robotic manipulation, including sparse sampling in point-based methods and sensitivity to depth noise in image-based approaches.

Method: SpatialActor employs a Semantic-guided Geometric Module for adaptive fusion of geometry and a Spatial Transformer for accurate 2D-3D mapping using low-level spatial cues.

Result: SpatialActor achieved state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench, 13.9%-19.4% improvement under noisy conditions, enhanced few-shot task generalization, and robustness to spatial perturbations.

Conclusion: SpatialActor provides a robust and accurate solution for robotic manipulation by resolving key limitations of decoupled semantics and geometry, making it effective in diverse practical scenarios.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires precise spatial understanding to interact with objects in the real world. Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations. Project Page: https://shihao1895.github.io/SpatialActor

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of large vision models lacking precise geometric understanding required for dexterous 3D grasping by robotic hands.

Method: A force-closure grasp generation pipeline, leveraging simulation for local geometric understanding, is combined with a diffusion model trained on distillation data for real-time operations on camera point clouds.

Result: The proposed approach integrates semantic understanding from large vision models with simulation-based geometric precision, achieving semantic grasping without manual training data.

Conclusion: The method achieves high-performance robotic grasping by fusing global semantic knowledge and local geometric precision, showcasing its effectiveness without requiring manual data collection.

Abstract: Large Vision Models trained on internet-scale data have demonstrated strong capabilities in segmenting and semantically understanding object parts, even in cluttered, crowded scenes. However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.

*Jarin Tasnim,Debasish Chakroborti,Chanchal K. Roy,Kevin A. Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Backporting introduces technical debt in software maintenance, with 4.3% of cases causing new debt across Apache, Eclipse, and Python ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why technical debt arises during backporting in stable software versions.

Method: Analyzed 105,396 commits from 31,076 backport sources in 87 repositories across three software ecosystems (Apache, Eclipse, Python).

Result: Approximately 4.3% of backports create technical debt; Apache has the highest absolute debt cases while Python and Eclipse have higher debt-to-commit ratios.

Conclusion: Backporting can lead to technical debt, especially in early cycles for Apache and mid-cycles for Python and Eclipse; inexperienced developers or those under high workloads contribute more to debt formation.

Abstract: Maintaining software is an ongoing process that stretches beyond the initial release. Stable software versions continuously evolve to fix bugs, add improvements, address security issues, and ensure compatibility. This ongoing support involves Backporting, which means taking a fix or update from a newer version and applying it to an older version of the same software. As software versions evolve, new technical debt can arise during backport maintenance activities. This study examines the technical debt involved in fixing 105,396 commits from 31,076 backport sources across 87 repositories in three software ecosystems (Apache, Eclipse, and Python). The goal is to identify when and why new technical debt arises during backporting in stable source code. Our results indicate that approximately 4.3% of backports introduce new technical debt. Apache contributes the most absolute instances, while Python and Eclipse exhibit nearly three times higher debt-to-commit ratios than Apache. Feature migrations make older Apache releases debt-prone in the early phase, whereas Python and Eclipse releases tend to accumulate technical debt mostly during the middle phase of their release cycles. Additionally, developers who are inexperienced, under high workloads, or non-owners are more likely to introduce technical debt during backporting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated approach to generate test plans for live testing in production environments, minimizing disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual test plan design is tedious, prone to errors, and increasingly challenging for large, complex systems.

Method: The authors propose a method for automating the generation of test plans to orchestrate test activities and mitigate interference with production traffic.

Result: The proposed approach successfully reduces service disruptions caused by live testing, demonstrated through a case study.

Conclusion: Automating test plan generation improves efficiency and ensures smooth testing in production environments with minimized disruptions.

Abstract: Live testing is performed in the production environment ideally without causing unacceptable disturbance to the production traffic. Thus, test activities have to be orchestrated properly to avoid interferences with the production traffic. A test plan is the road map that specifies how the test activities need to be orchestrated. Developing a test plan includes tasks such as test configuration selection/generation, test configuration deployment planning, creating the test runs schedule, choosing strategies to mitigate the risk of interferences, etc. The manual design of a test plan is tedious and error prone. This task becomes harder especially when the systems are large and complex. In this paper we propose an approach for automating test plans generation. With this approach we aim at reducing service disruption that may be induced by the testing activities in production. We illustrate our approach with a case study and discuss its different aspects.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a low-data domain coding assistant for industrial use, focusing on generating high-quality code with limited data and avoiding reliance on cloud solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Companies are hesitant to use cloud-based coding solutions due to trust issues, and training coding assistants for proprietary Programmable Logic Controller languages is challenging due to domain specificity.

Method: The authors developed a local coding assistant using small fine-tuned models on edge devices, combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), reasoning, bug correction, and code validity checks for enhanced performance.

Result: The tool effectively generated high-quality code for industrial use through prompt engineering, directed retrieval, bug correction, and user feedback evaluation, validated with code compilation metrics.

Conclusion: A RAG-based coding assistant can succeed in low-data contexts for industrial applications using fine-tuned local models and robust engineering practices, providing a viable alternative to cloud-based LLMs.

Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers are operated by proprietary code dialects; this makes it challenging to train coding assistants. Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPLVD, a novel model for software vulnerability detection that adopts a self-paced learning approach, achieving superior accuracy and precision over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing software vulnerability detection models face accuracy limitations due to low-quality training data. This calls for a new approach to improve vulnerability detection.

Method: SPLVD employs self-paced learning by dynamically selecting training data based on training progression, prioritizing easier source code at earlier training stages using a specially designed data selector.

Result: SPLVD achieves significantly higher F1 scores (89.2%, 68.7%, and 43.5%) across benchmark datasets and records a 90.9% precision on OpenHarmony projects.

Conclusion: SPLVD demonstrates considerable improvement in accurately detecting software vulnerabilities, showcasing its potential for practical application.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities are major risks to software systems. Recently, researchers have proposed many deep learning approaches to detect software vulnerabilities. However, their accuracy is limited in practice. One of the main causes is low-quality training data (i.e., source code). To this end, we propose a new approach: SPLVD (Self-Paced Learning for Software Vulnerability Detection). SPLVD dynamically selects source code for model training based on the stage of training, which simulates the human learning process progressing from easy to hard. SPLVD has a data selector that is specifically designed for the vulnerability detection task, which enables it to prioritize the learning of easy source code. Before each training epoch, SPLVD uses the data selector to recalculate the difficulty of the source code, select new training source code, and update the data selector. When evaluating SPLVD, we first use three benchmark datasets with over 239K source code in which 25K are vulnerable for standard evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that SPLVD achieves the highest F1 of 89.2%, 68.7%, and 43.5%, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. Then we collect projects from OpenHarmony, a new ecosystem that has not been learned by general LLMs, to evaluate SPLVD further. SPLVD achieves the highest precision of 90.9%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AILINKPREVIEWER, a tool leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate link previews in Pull Requests for enhanced code review efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of link integration in automated Pull Request tasks, which increases cognitive load for developers and limits available contextual information.

Method: AILINKPREVIEWER employs LLMs to generate contextual/non-contextual summaries and metadata-based previews from PR metadata (titles, descriptions, comments, link content). Three approaches were analyzed and compared.

Result: Contextual LLM summaries outperformed in metrics like BLEU and BERTScore, but user studies showed preference for non-contextual summaries due to their usability.

Conclusion: LLM-powered previews enhance code review efficiency and context richness, but there is a trade-off between metric performance and user preference.

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, where developers evaluate code changes to ensure quality and maintainability. Links to issues and external resources are often included in Pull Requests (PRs) to provide additional context, yet they are typically discarded in automated tasks such as PR summarization and code review comment generation. This limits the richness of information available to reviewers and increases cognitive load by forcing context-switching. To address this gap, we present AILINKPREVIEWER, a tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate previews of links in PRs using PR metadata, including titles, descriptions, comments, and link body content. We analyzed 50 engineered GitHub repositories and compared three approaches: Contextual LLM summaries, Non-Contextual LLM summaries, and Metadata-based previews. The results in metrics such as BLEU, BERTScore, and compression ratio show that contextual summaries consistently outperform other methods. However, in a user study with seven participants, most preferred non-contextual summaries, suggesting a trade-off between metric performance and perceived usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-powered link previews to enhance code review efficiency and to provide richer context for developers and automation in software engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of use case models is labor-intensive and often skipped in practice, creating a necessity for an efficient alternative.

Method: Integrates an open-weight LLM with advanced prompt engineering techniques to systematically extract actors and use cases from software requirements.

Result: The proposed method accelerates use case modeling by 60% while maintaining model quality, according to an exploratory study with professional software engineers.

Conclusion: The LLM-based approach enhances modeling efficiency and offers valuable process guidance, proving to be a practical solution in simplifying use case modeling.

Abstract: Use case modeling employs user-centered scenarios to outline system requirements. These help to achieve consensus among relevant stakeholders. Because the manual creation of use case models is demanding and time-consuming, it is often skipped in practice. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in this tedious process. The proposed method integrates an open-weight LLM to systematically extract actors and use cases from software requirements with advanced prompt engineering techniques. The method is evaluated using an exploratory study conducted with five professional software engineers, which compares traditional manual modeling to the proposed LLM-based approach. The results show a substantial acceleration, reducing the modeling time by 60\%. At the same time, the model quality remains on par. Besides improving the modeling efficiency, the participants indicated that the method provided valuable guidance in the process.

TL;DR: This paper studies configuration files for Claude Code projects, analyzing their concerns and practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how configuration files shape behavior and effectiveness of agentic code assistants like Claude Code.

Method: Empirical study analyzing 328 configuration files from Claude Code-related projects.

Result: Findings emphasize importance of diverse concerns in configuration files, especially architectural specifications.

Conclusion: Agent configuration files play a critical role in shaping agent behavior by addressing software engineering concerns and practices.

Abstract: Agentic code assistants are a new generation of AI systems capable of performing end-to-end software engineering tasks. While these systems promise unprecedented productivity gains, their behavior and effectiveness depend heavily on configuration files that define architectural constraints, coding practices, and tool usage policies. However, little is known about the structure and content of these configuration artifacts. This paper presents an empirical study of the configuration ecosystem of Claude Code, one of the most widely used agentic coding systems. We collected and analyzed 328 configuration files from public Claude Code projects to identify (i) the software engineering concerns and practices they specify and (ii) how these concerns co-occur within individual files. The results highlight the importance of defining a wide range of concerns and practices in agent configuration files, with particular emphasis on specifying the architecture the agent should follow.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Routesplain, a routing framework designed for improving LLM performance on software-related tasks by using human-understandable query concepts, offering better accuracy and cost-efficiency compared to other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the variability in LLM performance across software-related tasks and improve accuracy while reducing costs by routing user queries intelligently.

Method: Routesplain uses interpretable concepts extracted from user queries to route them to appropriate LLMs. It evaluates 16 state-of-the-art LLMs on eight tasks and compares performance against black-box routing baselines.

Result: Routesplain improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness in software-related tasks compared to individual LLMs and competitive black-box methods.

Conclusion: Routesplain provides a more rational and interpretable approach to routing queries for software-related tasks, outperforming alternatives and opening possibilities for further improvements.

Abstract: LLMs now tackle a wide range of software-related tasks, yet we show that their performance varies markedly both across and within these tasks. Routing user queries to the appropriate LLMs can therefore help improve response quality while reducing cost. Prior work, however, has focused mainly on general-purpose LLM routing via black-box models. We introduce Routesplain, the first LLM router for software-related tasks, including multilingual code generation and repair, input/output prediction, and computer science QA. Unlike existing routing approaches, Routesplain first extracts human-interpretable concepts from each query (e.g., task, domain, reasoning complexity) and only routes based on these concepts, thereby providing intelligible, faithful rationales. We evaluate Routesplain on 16 state-of-the-art LLMs across eight software-related tasks; Routesplain outperforms individual models both in terms of accuracy and cost, and equals or surpasses all black-box baselines, with concept-level intervention highlighting avenues for further router improvements.

TL;DR: The paper presents a personalized model for predicting Alzheimer's disease progression using MRI and PET data, outperforming current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and predicting the progression of Alzheimer's disease at an individual level to improve clinical outcomes.

Method: The study uses a graph-based dynamical model to analyze longitudinal MRI and PET data, constructing individualized brain graphs to predict neurodegeneration.

Result: The model accurately forecasts AD biomarkers and cognitive decline, identifies progression subtypes, and pinpoints regions driving disease spread.

Conclusion: The personalized network-based framework enhances AD trajectory prediction and holds potential for improving treatment strategies and clinical research.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive spread of pathology across brain networks, yet forecasting this cascade at the individual level remains challenging. We present a personalized graph-based dynamical model that captures the spatiotemporal evolution of cortical atrophy from longitudinal MRI and PET data. The approach constructs individualized brain graphs and learns the dynamics driving regional neurodegeneration. Applied to 1,891 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the model accurately predicts key AD biomarkers -- including amyloid-beta, tau, neurodegeneration, and cognition -- outperforming clinical and neuroimaging benchmarks. Patient-specific parameters reveal distinct progression subtypes and anticipate future cognitive decline more effectively than standard biomarkers. Sensitivity analysis highlights regional drivers of disease spread, reproducing known temporolimbic and frontal vulnerability patterns. This network-based digital twin framework offers a quantitative, personalized paradigm for AD trajectory prediction, with implications for patient stratification, clinical trial design, and targeted therapeutic development.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper analyzes brain dynamics during different cortical states (wake/sleep stages) using iEEG data from 106 patients. It employs symbolic methodologies to identify distinct signal patterns for each stage and validates findings with a computational model and SVM classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how brain dynamics differ between wake and sleep stages, which is vital for uncovering processes such as memory consolidation and identifying potential indicators of neurological disorders.

Method: Using intracranial EEG recordings, the study characterizes signals with Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE) and Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM). Data is analyzed by mapping on a complexity-entropy plane and validated through computational models and SVM classification.

Result: Distinct dynamic signatures for each sleep stage were identified. Computational models successfully reproduced empirical data, and SVM achieved high accuracy in distinguishing cortical states.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates how combining empirical data analysis, computational modeling, and machine learning can effectively characterize and classify brain dynamics across wake and sleep stages.

Abstract: Characterizing the brain dynamics during different cortical states can reveal valuable information about its patterns across various cognitive processes. In particular, studying the differences between awake and sleep stages can shed light on the understanding of brain processes essential for physical and mental well-being, such as memory consolidation, information processing, and fatigue recovery. Alterations in these patterns may indicate disorders and pathologies such as obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, as well as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Here, we analyze time series obtained from intracranial recordings of 106 patients, covering four sleep stages: Wake, N2, N3, and REM. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), which can include electrocorticography (ECoG) and depth recordings, represents the state-of-the-art measurements of brain activity, offering unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution for investigating neural dynamics. We characterize the signals using Bandt and Pompe symbolic methodology to calculate the Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE) and the Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM) based on the Jensen and Shannon disequilibrium. By mapping the data onto the complexity-entropy plane, we observe that each stage occupies a distinct region, revealing its own dynamic signature. We show that our empirical results can be reproduced by a whole-brain computational model, in which each cortical region is described by a mean-field formulation based on networks of Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) neurons, adjusting the adaptation parameter to simulate the different sleep stages. Finally, we show that a classification approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) provides high accuracy in distinguishing between cortical states.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a thermodynamic-inspired framework to analyze neuropsychological systems using macroscopic state variables, demonstrating applications in mother-infant EEG dyads and optogenetic mouse models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify stability and reconfiguration in neuropsychological systems using macroscopic physical concepts to offer compact and grounded descriptors of complex brain-behavior interactions.

Method: The framework utilizes statistical thermodynamics, applying variables like entropy, internal energy, temperature, and Helmholtz free energy to EEG data and behavior in human and mouse studies.

Result: It successfully dissociates neural reconfiguration from behavioral outcomes and traces thermodynamic state transitions in both human and mouse datasets, aligning with behavioral and task-related changes.

Conclusion: The proposed thermodynamic framework provides a robust descriptor that generalizes across species and tasks, capturing coherent patterns in neuropsychological systems.

Abstract: This work presents a statistical thermodynamics-inspired framework that summarizes multichannel EEG and behavior using macroscopic state variables (entropy, internal energy, temperature, Helmholtz free energy) to quantify stability and reconfiguration in neuropsychological systems. Applied to mother-infant EEG dyads performing the A-not-B task, these variables dissociate neural reconfiguration from behavioral success across a large set of model and feature configurations. Informational heat increases during environmental switches and decision errors, consistent with increased information exchange with the task context. In contrast, correct choices are preceded by lower temperature and higher free energy in the window, and are followed by free-energy declines as the system re-stabilizes. In an independent optogenetic dam-pup paradigm, the same variables separate stimulation conditions and trace coherent trajectories in thermodynamic state space. Together, these findings show that the thermoinformational framework yields compact, physically grounded descriptors that hold in both human and mouse datasets studied here.

*Yuxin Bai,Aranyak Acharyya,Ashwin De Silva,Zeyu Shen,James Hassett,Joshua T. Vogelstein*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Prospective Control,' a framework extending PAC learning to address learning and control in non-stationary environments, proving its efficiency over reinforcement learning in tasks like foraging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between reinforcement learning and PAC learning frameworks for optimal control in dynamic, non-stationary environments.

Method: The authors extend the PAC learning framework into 'Prospective Control,' proving that empirical risk minimization can asymptotically achieve the Bayes optimal policy and evaluating its performance on tasks like foraging.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates significant efficiency over reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly in non-stationary foraging tasks.

Conclusion: Prospective Control provides a robust extension of PAC learning to solve dynamic control challenges, outperforming traditional reinforcement learning methods in non-stationary environments.

Abstract: Optimal control of the future is the next frontier for AI. Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning or online learning. While powerful, these frameworks for learning are mathematically distinct from Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, which has been the workhorse for the recent technological achievements in AI. We therefore build on the prior work of prospective learning, an extension of PAC learning (without control) in non-stationary environments (De Silva et al., 2023; Silva et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2026). Here, we further extend the PAC learning framework to address learning and control in non-stationary environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Control'', we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective control, foraging, which is a canonical task for any mobile agent, be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents.

TL;DR: This study explores the effects of introducing noise in training-set classes on classification tasks, using the BCOPS algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the impact of noise on model performance and prediction abstention rates using the BCOPS algorithm.

Method: Synthetic and real datasets were utilized to test the BCOPS algorithm in noisy and outlier scenarios.

Result: Small amounts of noise cause significant detriments to the model's performance and prediction robustness.

Conclusion: The robustness of the BCOPS algorithm diminishes with even minor noise additions to training classes, highlighting sensitivity in classification tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of adding noise to the training set classes in classification tasks using the BCOPS algorithm (Balanced and Conformal Optimized Prediction Sets), proposed by Guan & Tibshirani (2022). The BCOPS algorithm is an application of conformal prediction combined with a machine learning method to construct prediction sets such that the probability of the true class being included in the prediction set for a test observation meets a specified coverage guarantee. An observation is considered an outlier if its true class is not present in the training set. The study employs both synthetic and real datasets and conducts experiments to evaluate the prediction abstention rate for outlier observations and the model's robustness in this previously untested scenario. The results indicate that the addition of noise, even in small amounts, can have a significant effect on model performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference, addressing issues caused by unreliable uncertainty estimates in AI-assisted data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve estimation accuracy in AI-assisted data collection, while addressing the problem of inaccurate uncertainty estimates leading to noisy results.

Method: The authors propose interpolating optimally between uniform and active sampling, based on the reliability of uncertainty scores, and incorporate concepts from robust optimization.

Result: The method ensures the estimator performs at least as well as uniform sampling and generally better with reliable uncertainty estimates, demonstrated on real datasets.

Conclusion: By using robust sampling strategies, the paper achieves improved estimation accuracy while mitigating the risks of inaccurate uncertainty estimates in active sampling.

Abstract: Active statistical inference is a new method for inference with AI-assisted data collection. Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the increasing interest in self-consuming generative models and the need to analyze their retraining dynamics, especially in settings where traditional techniques fail.

Method: The authors use mathematical frameworks including nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theory to investigate retraining dynamics across four regimes and provide stability analyses.

Result: They derive convergence results in regimes where Banach contraction mapping arguments are not applicable and offer insights into the stability and instability of the retraining dynamics.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of self-consuming generative models, generalizes previous findings, and offers important mathematical insights into their dynamics and stability behavior.

Abstract: Self-consuming generative models have received significant attention over the last few years. In this paper, we study a self-consuming generative model with heterogeneous preferences that is a generalization of the model in Ferbach et al. (2024). The model is retrained round by round using real data and its previous-round synthetic outputs. The asymptotic behavior of the retraining dynamics is investigated across four regimes using different techniques including the nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theory. Our analyses improve upon that of Ferbach et al. (2024) and provide convergence results in settings where the well-known Banach contraction mapping arguments do not apply. Stability and non-stability results regarding the retraining dynamics are also given.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional validation methods for generative models in high-dimensional data scenarios, such as scalability, statistical power, and interpretability.

Method: The paper proposes the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM), a learning-based approach inspired by the Neyman-Pearson construction, for goodness-of-fit testing of generative networks.

Result: NPLM was tested on mixtures of Gaussian models with different dimensions and on the FlashSim generator for high-energy physics data. It demonstrated strong validation capabilities and identified regions where the generative models performed sub-optimally.

Conclusion: NPLM is a powerful tool for validating high-dimensional generative models and can identify areas where models need improvement, thus enhancing their reliability in scientific workflows.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly central to scientific workflows, yet their systematic use and interpretation require a proper understanding of their limitations through rigorous validation. Classic approaches struggle with scalability, statistical power, or interpretability when applied to high-dimensional data, making it difficult to certify the reliability of these models in realistic, high-dimensional scientific settings. Here, we propose the use of the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM), a learning based approach to goodness-of-fit testing inspired by the Neyman-Pearson construction, to test generative networks trained on high-dimensional scientific data. We demonstrate the performance of NPLM for validation in two benchmark cases: generative models trained on mixtures of Gaussian models with increasing dimensionality, and a public end-to-end generator for the Large Hadron Collider called FlashSim, trained on jet data, typical in the field of high-energy physics. We demonstrate that the NPLM can serve as a powerful validation method while also providing a means to diagnose sub-optimally modeled regions of the data.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative modeling framework called Branching Flows that operates over binary trees to address challenges in generating sequences of variable lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing generative approaches that struggle with tasks where the length or number of elements is not predetermined, such as protein design or language model responses.

Method: The proposed method uses Branching Flows, which transport distributions via stochastic branching and dying processes learned by the model, operating over binary tree structures.

Result: Branching Flows demonstrated effective generative capabilities in small molecule generation (multimodal), antibody sequence generation (discrete), and protein backbone generation (multimodal).

Conclusion: Branching Flows is a versatile and stable generative modeling tool for diverse domains and flexible tasks, enabling new capabilities in state evolution and variable-length sequence control.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching approaches to generative modeling have shown promise in domains where the state space is continuous, such as image generation or protein folding & design, and discrete, exemplified by diffusion large language models. They offer a natural fit when the number of elements in a state is fixed in advance (e.g. images), but require ad hoc solutions when, for example, the length of a response from a large language model, or the number of amino acids in a protein chain is not known a priori.
  Here we propose Branching Flows, a generative modeling framework that, like diffusion and flow matching approaches, transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. But in Branching Flows, the elements in the state evolve over a forest of binary trees, branching and dying stochastically with rates that are learned by the model. This allows the model to control, during generation, the number of elements in the sequence. We also show that Branching Flows can compose with any flow matching base process on discrete sets, continuous Euclidean spaces, smooth manifolds, and `multimodal' product spaces that mix these components. We demonstrate this in three domains: small molecule generation (multimodal), antibody sequence generation (discrete), and protein backbone generation (multimodal), and show that Branching Flows is a capable distribution learner with a stable learning objective, and that it enables new capabilities.

*Antonio Di Noia,Federico Ravenda,Antonietta Mira*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper discusses improving dimensionality reduction methods by utilizing an intrinsic dimension estimator for adaptive tuning of hyperparameters such as neighborhood size and target dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately capturing non-linearity in data during dimensionality reduction and improving local embeddings by optimizing neighborhood structures and dimensional space.

Method: Uses a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator to adaptively determine optimal neighborhood sizes for dimensionality reduction algorithms.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate improved projection methods on real-world and simulated data, achieving better learning task results and visualization quality.

Conclusion: The adaptive framework effectively enhances dimensionality reduction methods, optimizing local neighborhood structures and delivering improved computational outcomes.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task in modern data science. Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations.

*Tengyuan Liang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses denoising from noisy measurements when the noise distribution is unknown, proposing universal denoisers that outperform Bayes-optimal denoisers for reconstructing the underlying signal distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve denoising techniques where noise level is known but noise distribution is not, focusing on reconstructing the underlying signal distribution rather than individual realizations.

Method: The authors propose universal denoisers inspired by optimal transport and based on score matching. These denoisers refine distributional shrinkage and achieve higher accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions.

Result: The proposed denoisers outperform Tweedie's formula-derived Bayes-optimal denoisers, offering significant accuracy improvements such as $O(σ^4)$ and $O(σ^6)$ when reconstructing the signal distribution $P_X$.

Conclusion: Replacing Bayes-optimal denoisers with the proposed formulas achieves less aggressive shrinkage and higher-order accuracy for optimal reconstruction of the signal distribution.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of denoising from noisy measurements where only the noise level is known, not the noise distribution. In multi-dimensions, independent noise $Z$ corrupts the signal $X$, resulting in the noisy measurement $Y = X + σZ$, where $σ\in (0, 1)$ is a known noise level. Our goal is to recover the underlying signal distribution $P_X$ from denoising $P_Y$. We propose and analyze universal denoisers that are agnostic to a wide range of signal and noise distributions. Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(σ^4)$ and $O(σ^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Ampère equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.
  Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \[ \mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + σ^2 \nabla \log q(y), \] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \[ \mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \frac{σ^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y), \] \[ \mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \frac{σ^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y) - \frac{σ^4}{8} \nabla \left( \frac{1}{2} \| \nabla \log q(y) \|^2 + \nabla \cdot \nabla \log q(y) \right) . \]

*Kapil Garg,Xinru Tang,Jimin Heo,Dwayne R. Morgan,Darren Gergle,Erik B. Sudderth,Anne Marie Piper*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Investigates the impact of image quality on the accuracy of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in generating captions for blind and low-vision (BLV) people.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how image quality issues impact VLM performance and whether the captions produced meet the information needs of BLV individuals.

Method: Surveyed 86 BLV people and conducted systematic evaluations of VLM-generated captions with varying image quality issues.

Result: The best model achieved 98% accuracy for images without quality issues but dropped to 75% accuracy when issues were present, with severe declines as issues compounded.

Conclusion: Model evaluations should prioritize disabled people's experiences, and researchers should improve VLM reliability for BLV individuals.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used by blind and low-vision (BLV) people to identify and understand products in their everyday lives, such as food, personal products, and household goods. Despite their prevalence, we lack an empirical understanding of how common image quality issues, like blur and misframing of items, affect the accuracy of VLM-generated captions and whether resulting captions meet BLV people's information needs. Grounded in a survey with 86 BLV people, we systematically evaluate how image quality issues affect captions generated by VLMs. We show that the best model recognizes products in images with no quality issues with 98% accuracy, but drops to 75% accuracy overall when quality issues are present, worsening considerably as issues compound. We discuss the need for model evaluations that center on disabled people's experiences throughout the process and offer concrete recommendations for HCI and ML researchers to make VLMs more reliable for BLV people.

### [317] [Plug-and-Play Clarifier: A Zero-Shot Multimodal Framework for Egocentric Intent Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08971)
*Sicheng Yang,Yukai Huang,Weitong Cai,Shitong Sun,You He,Jiankang Deng,Hang Zhang,Jifei Song,Zhensong Zhang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Plug-and-Play Clarifier framework to address multimodal intent ambiguity in egocentric AI agents, involving three modules: text clarifier, vision clarifier, and cross-modal clarifier, all aimed at resolving ambiguity and improving interactive AI performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the performance limitations of egocentric AI agents caused by multimodal intent ambiguity stemming from underspecified language, imperfect visuals, and gestures, which affect task outcomes.

Method: The framework is modular and zero-shot, composed of: (1) a text clarifier for linguistic intent disambiguation through interactive dialogue, (2) a vision clarifier providing real-time feedback for better visual input, and (3) a cross-modal clarifier interpreting 3D pointing gestures for object grounding.

Result: Experiments show enhancements such as a 30% improvement in intent clarification for small language models, 20% improvement in vision-based corrective guidance, and 5% better accuracy in cross-modal referential grounding.

Conclusion: The plug-and-play framework effectively addresses multimodal ambiguity challenges in egocentric interactions, improving not only task success rates but also overall user experience, making AI models more competitive and accurate.

Abstract: The performance of egocentric AI agents is fundamentally limited by multimodal intent ambiguity. This challenge arises from a combination of underspecified language, imperfect visual data, and deictic gestures, which frequently leads to task failure. Existing monolithic Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to resolve these multimodal ambiguous inputs, often failing silently or hallucinating responses. To address these ambiguities, we introduce the Plug-and-Play Clarifier, a zero-shot and modular framework that decomposes the problem into discrete, solvable sub-tasks. Specifically, our framework consists of three synergistic modules: (1) a text clarifier that uses dialogue-driven reasoning to interactively disambiguate linguistic intent, (2) a vision clarifier that delivers real-time guidance feedback, instructing users to adjust their positioning for improved capture quality, and (3) a cross-modal clarifier with grounding mechanism that robustly interprets 3D pointing gestures and identifies the specific objects users are pointing to. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework improves the intent clarification performance of small language models (4--8B) by approximately 30%, making them competitive with significantly larger counterparts. We also observe consistent gains when applying our framework to these larger models. Furthermore, our vision clarifier increases corrective guidance accuracy by over 20%, and our cross-modal clarifier improves semantic answer accuracy for referential grounding by 5%. Overall, our method provides a plug-and-play framework that effectively resolves multimodal ambiguity and significantly enhances user experience in egocentric interaction.

### [318] [TaskSense: Cognitive Chain Modeling and Difficulty Estimation for GUI Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09309)
*Yiwen Yin,Zhian Hu,Xiaoxi Xu,Chun Yu,Xintong Wu,Wenyu Fan,Yuanchun Shi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cognitive Chain, a framework to model GUI task difficulty from a cognitive perspective, providing insights into human-AI consistency and agent capability gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI task difficulty measures overlook cognitive demands, focusing primarily on motor actions.

Method: The authors propose Cognitive Chain, which decomposes tasks into cognitive steps with difficulty indices based on information theories. They use an LLM-based method for automatic extraction of cognitive chains.

Result: Cognitive difficulty estimated by the framework correlates with user completion time, and state-of-the-art agents struggle on cognitively demanding tasks, highlighting capability gaps.

Conclusion: The paper suggests applications of the framework for improving agent training, evaluating capabilities, and optimizing human-agent interactions.

Abstract: Measuring GUI task difficulty is crucial for user behavior analysis and agent capability evaluation. Yet, existing benchmarks typically quantify difficulty based on motor actions (e.g., step counts), overlooking the cognitive demands underlying task completion. In this work, we propose Cognitive Chain, a novel framework that models task difficulty from a cognitive perspective. A cognitive chain decomposes the cognitive processes preceding a motor action into a sequence of cognitive steps (e.g., finding, deciding, computing), each with a difficulty index grounded in information theories. We develop an LLM-based method to automatically extract cognitive chains from task execution traces. Validation with linear regression shows that our estimated cognitive difficulty correlates well with user completion time (step-level R-square=0.46 after annotation). Assessment of state-of-the-art GUI agents shows reduced success on cognitively demanding tasks, revealing capability gaps and Human-AI consistency patterns. We conclude by discussing potential applications in agent training, capability assessment, and human-agent delegation optimization.

### [319] [Algorithmic Advice as a Strategic Signal on Competitive Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09454)
*Tobias R. Rebholz,Maxwell Uphoff,Christian H. R. Bernges,Florian Scholten*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper studies how algorithmic advice in economic games influences human behavior and market dynamics, demonstrating its potential to tacitly facilitate collusion and strategic coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the influence of algorithmic advice on strategic decision-making in competitive environments, addressing concerns around algorithmic collusion and market dynamics.

Method: Two pre-registered experiments were conducted using Bertrand price competition and Cournot quantity competition games, with participants receiving individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations that were either equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased.

Result: Algorithmic advice influenced pricing and production behaviors. Individualized, biased advice facilitated tacit collusion (higher prices or lower production), while equilibrium-aligned advice guided stable convergence. Participants responded more strongly to individualized advice.

Conclusion: Algorithmic advice can act as a strategic signal in competitive settings, enabling tacit coordination without explicit communication. This underscores the necessity for oversight in the design of such systems to prevent potential collusion.

Abstract: As algorithms increasingly mediate competitive decision-making, their influence extends beyond individual outcomes to shaping strategic market dynamics. In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments.

### [320] [Spatio-Temporal Data Enhanced Vision-Language Model for Traffic Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08978)
*Jingtian Ma,Jingyuan Wang,Wayne Xin Zhao,Guoping Liu,Xiang Wen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: A novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model (ST-CLIP) is proposed for Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), using spatio-temporal and vision-language data integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU) by integrating spatio-temporal and visual-textual data, which are often ignored in existing approaches.

Method: The proposed ST-CLIP model uses the CLIP backbone and introduces a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method. It includes a dynamic spatio-temporal representation module and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module.

Result: The model achieves superior performance in complex TSU scenarios, validated on two real-world datasets with a few-shot learning strategy.

Conclusion: This research contributes significantly by integrating spatio-temporal data into vision-language models, advancing TSU capabilities.

Abstract: Nowadays, navigation and ride-sharing apps have collected numerous images with spatio-temporal data. A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatiotemporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into visionlanguage models to facilitate TSU task. Experiments on two realworld datasets demonstrate superior performance in the complex scene understanding scenarios with a few-shot learning strategy.

*Lipisha Chaudhary,Trisha Mittal,Subhadra Gopalakrishnan,Ifeoma Nwogu,Jaclyn Pytlarz*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper presents MCAD, an end-to-end pipeline for generating audio descriptions (AD) for soccer games, without relying on ground truth AD. It fine-tunes a Video Large Language Model using movie AD datasets and incorporates multimodal cues during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make visual content accessible to individuals with visual impairments, especially in the domain of sports where audio descriptions are even less explored.

Method: The approach fine-tunes a Video Large Language Model on existing movie AD datasets to learn narrative conventions. During inference, it integrates multimodal cues like player identities and actions, soccer events, and game commentary to generate audio descriptions.

Result: MCAD successfully generates domain-specific AD for soccer games and introduces a new evaluation metric, ARGE-AD, which measures AD quality based on various characteristics. AD annotations for 100 soccer clips were created by experts.

Conclusion: MCAD advances automated AD generation beyond movies to niche domains like sports. Coupled with ARGE-AD, it facilitates accurate evaluation and sets a foundation for expanding accessibility tools to broader visual content.

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (AD) are essential for making visual content accessible to individuals with visual impairments. Recent works have shown a promising step towards automating AD, but they have been limited to describing high-quality movie content using human-annotated ground truth AD in the process. In this work, we present an end-to-end pipeline, MCAD, that extends AD generation beyond movies to the domain of sports, with a focus on soccer games, without relying on ground truth AD. To address the absence of domain-specific AD datasets, we fine-tune a Video Large Language Model on publicly available movie AD datasets so that it learns the narrative structure and conventions of AD. During inference, MCAD incorporates multimodal contextual cues such as player identities, soccer events and actions, and commentary from the game. These cues, combined with input prompts to the fine-tuned VideoLLM, allow the system to produce complete AD text for each video segment. We further introduce a new evaluation metric, ARGE-AD, designed to accurately assess the quality of generated AD. ARGE-AD evaluates the generated AD for the presence of five characteristics: (i) usage of people's names, (ii) mention of actions and events, (iii) appropriate length of AD, (iv) absence of pronouns, and (v) overlap from commentary or subtitles. We present an in-depth analysis of our approach on both movie and soccer datasets. We also validate the use of this metric to quantitatively comment on the quality of generated AD using our metric across domains. Additionally, we contribute audio descriptions for 100 soccer game clips annotated by two AD experts.

### [322] [Good-for-MDP State Reduction for Stochastic LTL Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09073)
*Christoph Weinhuber,Giuseppe De Giacomo,Yong Li,Sven Schewe,Qiyi Tang*

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: This paper addresses stochastic planning in MDPs with goals specified in LTL, proposing a novel state-space reduction method for GFM automata to improve scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for MDPs with LTL goals face scalability issues due to the large size of generated automata.

Method: The paper introduces a GFM state-space reduction technique using advanced transformations and a direct construction method for specific LTL formulas.

Result: The proposed techniques significantly reduce automata sizes and demonstrate practical scalability improvements in experiments.

Conclusion: The state-space reduction and specialized construction methods advance the scalability and practicality of solving MDPs with LTL specifications.

Abstract: We study stochastic planning problems in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with goals specified in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The state-of-the-art approach transforms LTL formulas into good-for-MDP (GFM) automata, which feature a restricted form of nondeterminism. These automata are then composed with the MDP, allowing the agent to resolve the nondeterminism during policy synthesis. A major factor affecting the scalability of this approach is the size of the generated automata. In this paper, we propose a novel GFM state-space reduction technique that significantly reduces the number of automata states. Our method employs a sophisticated chain of transformations, leveraging recent advances in good-for-games minimisation developed for adversarial settings. In addition to our theoretical contributions, we present empirical results demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our state-reduction technique. Furthermore, we introduce a direct construction method for formulas of the form $\mathsf{G}\mathsf{F}\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a co-safety formula. This construction is provably single-exponential in the worst case, in contrast to the general doubly-exponential complexity. Our experiments confirm the scalability advantages of this specialised construction.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a measurement-driven approach to predict early radio link failures in 5G railway environments using deep temporal models and lightweight features, enabling proactive measures like adaptive handovers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of early prediction of RLF in 5G railway environments, enhancing reliability and enabling proactive interventions.

Method: Six predictive models (CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, TimesNet) were benchmarked on metro-train traces under varied observation windows and prediction horizons.

Result: TimesNet achieved the best performance with the highest F1 score for a three-second horizon, while CNN offered a balanced accuracy-latency tradeoff for shorter prediction horizons.

Conclusion: Deep temporal models can predict reliability issues several seconds in advance, leveraging lightweight features on commercial devices to improve 5G railway system reliability.

Abstract: In this paper, a measurement-driven framework is proposed for early radio link failure (RLF) prediction in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10 Hz metro-train traces with serving and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six models, namely CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under varied observation windows and prediction horizons. When the observation window is three seconds, TimesNet attains the highest F1 score with a three-second prediction horizon, while CNN provides a favorable accuracy-latency tradeoff with a two-second horizon, enabling proactive actions such as redundancy and adaptive handovers. The results indicate that deep temporal models can anticipate reliability degradations several seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices, offering a practical path to early-warning control in 5G-based railway systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide solopreneurs with a structured approach for leveraging AI agents to overcome challenges of limited resources, while navigating creativity, decision-making, and scalable business growth.

Method: A 3-stage framework is proposed: (1) Imagination shaping (AI aids in market scanning, idea refinement), (2) Reality testing (AI helps prototype and gather feedback), and (3) Reality scaling (AI optimizes processes and scalability).

Result: The paper highlights the utility of AI agents as digital co-founders to enhance decision-making, creativity, and business scalability for solopreneurs.

Conclusion: AI agents can serve as pivotal tools for solopreneurs by enabling effective human-AI collaboration and addressing challenges like uncertainty and cognitive overload.

Abstract: This paper investigates how individual entrepreneurs can turn creative ideas into successful solo businesses in an era increasingly shaped by Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. It highlights the key steps that connect personal vision, structured experimentation, and lasting value creation, and shows how AI agents can act as digital co-founders throughout this journey. Building on research in entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, we present a framework with three key stages: (1) Imagination shaping, where vague goals become clear value propositions, supported by AI agents that help with market scanning, idea refinement, and rapid concept generation; (2) Reality testing, where these ideas are tested through low-cost experiments, structured feedback loops, and efficient execution, with AI agents automating tasks such as prototyping, content creation, customer interaction, and data analysis; and (3) Reality scaling, where successful ideas are transformed into repeatable processes, scalable market strategies, and long-term business models, increasingly operated and optimized by autonomous or semi-autonomous AI workflows. We focus on the specific context of solopreneurship, characterized by limited human resources, complete accountability for decision-making, and a strong association between the founder's identity and the business. The framework clearly identifies key enabling factors such as mental adaptability, effective planning, and successful human-AI collaboration within digital ecosystems. It also thoughtfully addresses ongoing challenges, like uncertainty and cognitive overload, which are heightened by our constant connectivity.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the challenges and solutions of integrating reinforcement learning in a mHealth clinical trial, LowSalt4Life 2, focused on reducing sodium intake via an app-based intervention for hypertensive patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness and reduce the burden of app-based health interventions by incorporating reinforcement learning into clinical trials, developing individualized treatment policies that adaptively engage participants.

Method: The trial deployed a reinforcement learning algorithm to send reminder notifications to app users in contexts where they were likely to engage with the app, based on real-time behavioral predictions.

Result: The study identified key implementation challenges, such as defining rewards, optimizing timescales, creating robust statistical models, ensuring computational efficiency, and addressing missing data, offering template solutions for each.

Conclusion: Integrating reinforcement learning into mHealth interventions improves their efficiency and personalization, but overcoming specific operational challenges is crucial for successful implementation and broader adoption.

Abstract: The ubiquitous nature of mobile health (mHealth) technology has expanded opportunities for the integration of reinforcement learning into traditional clinical trial designs, allowing researchers to learn individualized treatment policies during the study. LowSalt4Life 2 (LS4L2) is a recent trial aimed at reducing sodium intake among hypertensive individuals through an app-based intervention. A reinforcement learning algorithm, which was deployed in one of the trial arms, was designed to send reminder notifications to promote app engagement in contexts where the notification would be effective, i.e., when a participant is likely to open the app in the next 30-minute and not when prior data suggested reduced effectiveness. Such an algorithm can improve app-based mHealth interventions by reducing participant burden and more effectively promoting behavior change. We encountered various challenges during the implementation of the learning algorithm, which we present as a template to solving challenges in future trials that deploy reinforcement learning algorithms. We provide template solutions based on LS4L2 for solving the key challenges of (i) defining a relevant reward, (ii) determining a meaningful timescale for optimization, (iii) specifying a robust statistical model that allows for automation, (iv) balancing model flexibility with computational cost, and (v) addressing missing values in gradually collected data.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the increasing need for automated tools to prioritize and validate the growing number of exoplanet candidates detected by space missions.

Method: WATSON-Net is trained using Kepler data with 10-fold cross-validation, producing ten independent models. The preparation pipeline is standardized for extensibility to future missions like TESS.

Result: WATSON-Net achieves near state-of-the-art performance on Kepler data (R@P0.99 = 0.903) and is the best-performing non-fine-tuned classifier for TESS signals (precision 0.93, recall 0.76).

Conclusion: WATSON-Net is a robust, scalable tool fully integrated into the SHERLOCK pipeline, providing open-source solutions for exoplanet vetting across different missions.

Abstract: Context. As the number of detected transiting exoplanet candidates continues to grow, the need for robust and scalable automated tools to prioritize or validate them has become increasingly critical. Among the most promising solutions, deep learning models offer the ability to interpret complex diagnostic metrics traditionally used in the vetting process. Aims. In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives. Both the model and its data preparation tools are publicly available in the dearwatson Python package, fully open-source and integrated into the vetting engine of the SHERLOCK pipeline.

*Vukan Ninkovic,Dejan Vukobratovic*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Autoencoder-based methods are proposed for digital communication coding, overcoming gradient issues with a novel two-stage training procedure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the design of communication systems using data-driven autoencoder approaches, while addressing difficulties in enforcing binary codewords.

Method: Proposed a two-stage training procedure: continuous pretraining followed by direct binarization and fine-tuning without gradient approximations.

Result: The learned encoder-decoder pair recovers properties like linearity and distance of the optimal Hamming code, achieving optimal block error rate over the (7,4) configuration.

Conclusion: Compact autoencoder architectures can learn algebraically optimal binary codes effectively through the proposed training method.

Abstract: Error correcting codes play a central role in digital communication, ensuring that transmitted information can be accurately reconstructed despite channel impairments. Recently, autoencoder (AE) based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a data driven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. These results indicate that compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training.

*Haotian Yin,Aleksander Plocharski,Michal Jan Wlodarczyk,Przemyslaw Musialski*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a finite-difference method for curvature regularization in neural signed distance field (SDF) learning, aiming to improve computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational expense of existing curvature regularization methods that use higher-order differentiation or full Hessian information, which are costly in terms of GPU memory and training time.

Method: The proposed method employs finite-difference stencils based on Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2) to approximate second derivatives, replacing the need for full Hessian computation.

Result: The finite-difference approach achieves reconstruction accuracy comparable to methods using second-order automatic differentiation, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to 50%. It also proves robust with sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data.

Conclusion: The method offers a computationally efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning, with lower resource demands and robust performance in diverse data conditions.

Abstract: We introduce a finite-difference framework for curvature regularization in neural signed distance field (SDF) learning. Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two. Additional tests on sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data confirm that the proposed formulation is robust and general, offering an efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning.

*Qi Feng,Guang Lin,Purav Matlia,Denny Serdarevic*

Main category: q-fin.MF

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stochastic SINDy framework under a risk-neutral measure to recover BSDEs from limited financial data, bypassing the need for ergodicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional ergodicity-requiring approaches in identifying stochastic differential equations, especially for sparse financial data.

Method: Introduction of a stochastic SINDy approach under the risk-neutral probability measure to deduce BSDEs using limited financial time-series data.

Result: The algorithm enables forward-looking predictions and the generation of synthetic data paths aligned with the probabilistic law.

Conclusion: This framework eliminates the dependency on ergodicity, offering a novel method for recovering BSDEs and understanding probabilistic laws from financial data.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven framework for discovering probabilistic laws underlying the Feynman-Kac formula. Specifically, we introduce the first stochastic SINDy method formulated under the risk-neutral probability measure to recover the backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) from a single pair of stock and option trajectories. Unlike existing approaches to identifying stochastic differential equations-which typically require ergodicity-our framework leverages the risk-neutral measure, thereby eliminating the ergodicity assumption and enabling BSDE recovery from limited financial time series data. Using this algorithm, we are able not only to make forward-looking predictions but also to generate new synthetic data paths consistent with the underlying probabilistic law.

### [332] [A Deep Learning-Based Method for Fully Coupled Non-Markovian FBSDEs with Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08735)
*Hasib Uddin Molla,Ankit Banarjee,Matthew Backhouse,Jinniao Qiu*

Main category: q-fin.MF

TL;DR: The paper develops a deep learning approach for solving fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) in a non-Markovian framework, with error estimates, convergence analysis, and practical applications in utility maximization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the use of deep learning methods for more complex, fully coupled FBSDEs in non-Markovian frameworks, as these are relevant to advanced mathematical finance and control theory problems.

Method: The authors propose a novel deep learning-based approach that adapts to non-Markovian settings, where the drift and diffusion coefficients of the forward process depend on backward components $Y$ and $Z$. They also provide theoretical guarantees for error estimates and convergence.

Result: The new deep learning method successfully addresses the challenges of fully coupled FBSDEs. Additionally, it solves numerical examples, such as utility maximization problems under rough volatility, showcasing practical relevance.

Conclusion: The paper broadens the scope of deep learning-based numerical methods to handle non-Markovian, fully coupled FBSDEs, demonstrating both theoretical robustness and practical utility.

Abstract: In this work, we extend deep learning-based numerical methods to fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) within a non-Markovian framework. Error estimates and convergence are provided. In contrast to the existing literature, our approach not only analyzes the non-Markovian framework but also addresses fully coupled settings, in which both the drift and diffusion coefficients of the forward process may be random and depend on the backward components $Y$ and $Z$. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical applicability of our framework by addressing utility maximization problems under rough volatility, which are solved numerically with the proposed deep learning-based methods.

*Kelvin J. L. Koa,Jan Chen,Yunshan Ma,Huanhuan Zheng,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA) framework that combines natural language and time-series analysis to improve interpretable stock forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of integrating both textual reasoning and technical stock price analysis to improve interpretability and accuracy in forecasting.

Method: Stock price data is converted into textual annotations, and the reasoning trace is optimized with an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward. Time-series outputs are generated by conditioning on reasoning-based attributes.

Result: VTA achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy on stock datasets across U.S., Chinese, and European markets, and its reasoning traces are positively evaluated by industry experts.

Conclusion: VTA demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of combining verbal reasoning and technical analysis in stock forecasting, enhancing both interpretability and accuracy.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have been used to produce interpretable stock forecasts, they mainly focus on analyzing textual reports but not historical price data, also known as Technical Analysis. This task is challenging as it switches between domains: the stock price inputs and outputs lie in the time-series domain, while the reasoning step should be in natural language. In this work, we introduce Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA), a novel framework that combine verbal and latent reasoning to produce stock time-series forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable. To reason over time-series, we convert stock price data into textual annotations and optimize the reasoning trace using an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward objective. To produce time-series outputs from textual reasoning, we condition the outputs of a time-series backbone model on the reasoning-based attributes. Experiments on stock datasets across U.S., Chinese, and European markets show that VTA achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, while the reasoning traces also perform well on evaluation by industry experts.

### [335] [Multi-period Learning for Financial Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08622)
*Xu Zhang,Zhengang Huang,Yunzhi Wu,Xun Lu,Erpeng Qi,Yunkai Chen,Zhongya Xue,Qitong Wang,Peng Wang,Wei Wang*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) for financial time series forecasting, enhancing accuracy and efficiency by addressing multi-period characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for financial time series forecasting often fail to account for multi-period inputs and the interactions of short-term and medium-/long-term factors, which are crucial for improving prediction accuracy.

Method: The proposed MLF introduces three modules to optimize multi-period inputs: Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), and Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP). A Patch Squeeze module is also added to improve efficiency.

Result: MLF enhances both forecasting accuracy and efficiency by effectively integrating multi-period inputs, contributing to better predictions and reduced complexity. The framework eliminates redundancy and mitigates bias across periods.

Conclusion: MLF provides a novel approach to financial time series forecasting by integrating multi-period data more effectively and efficiently, making it a practical and innovative solution with accessible codes and datasets.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is important in finance domain. Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF). However, current TSF models either use only single-period input, or lack customized designs for addressing multi-period characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/MLF.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: This paper introduces federated learning for predicting financial distress at a state level in the U.S., ensuring data privacy while offering explainable AI insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address sensitive data centralization challenges and develop a socially responsible AI framework for predicting financial distress in diverse governance systems.

Method: Uses federated learning with states as independent data silos and integrates two explainable AI techniques for global and local insights. It utilizes a machine learning model tailored for categorical and imbalanced survey data.

Result: The framework identifies predictors of financial distress, ensuring data privacy and demonstrating scalable early warning systems for consumer credit risk.

Conclusion: Federated learning is presented as a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for socially responsible AI in financial inclusion and credit risk assessment.

Abstract: We present the first application of federated learning (FL) to the U.S. National Financial Capability Study, introducing an interpretable framework for predicting consumer financial distress across all 50 states and the District of Columbia without centralizing sensitive data. Our cross-silo FL setup treats each state as a distinct data silo, simulating real-world governance in nationwide financial systems. Unlike prior work, our approach integrates two complementary explainable AI techniques to identify both global (nationwide) and local (state-specific) predictors of financial hardship, such as contact from debt collection agencies. We develop a machine learning model specifically suited for highly categorical, imbalanced survey data. This work delivers a scalable, regulation-compliant blueprint for early warning systems in finance, demonstrating how FL can power socially responsible AI applications in consumer credit risk and financial inclusion.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores neural network architectures for predicting long-term financial time-series indexes across global markets and studies cross-training effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether training on indexes from one market yields comparable results for predicting another market’s indexes using neural network architectures.

Method: Various artificial neural network models are tested for cross-market predictions, analyzing their correlation in behavior.

Result: Training on one market's index demonstrated mostly positive results when applied to another market, supporting cross-predictions.

Conclusion: The findings align with the Efficient Market Hypothesis, suggesting cross-market learning can deliver effective financial forecasts.

Abstract: We investigate a number of Artificial Neural Network architectures (well-known and more ``exotic'') in application to the long-term financial time-series forecasts of indexes on different global markets. The particular area of interest of this research is to examine the correlation of these indexes' behaviour in terms of Machine Learning algorithms cross-training. Would training an algorithm on an index from one global market produce similar or even better accuracy when such a model is applied for predicting another index from a different market? The demonstrated predominately positive answer to this question is another argument in favour of the long-debated Efficient Market Hypothesis of Eugene Fama.

### [338] [Compact Artificial Neural Network Models for Predicting Protein Residue -- RNA Base Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08648)
*Stanislav Selitskiy*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: This study investigates using small Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for protein-RNA binding prediction, showing they can achieve good accuracy without extensive computational resources by optimizing training methods and model structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large ANN models require significant computational resources and large datasets, which are often unavailable to researchers, especially in the life sciences field where data is commonly limited.

Method: Shallow feed-forward ANN models were used with two hidden layers and non-linearities. These models employed a sliding window approach for context and experimented with different training techniques for unbalanced data.

Result: Only three non-linearities, ReLU, GLU, and Tanh, produced converging models. Increasing training data and using model ensembles significantly improved performance. The optimal context window size was approximately 30 residues and bases.

Conclusion: Small ANN models can achieve high accuracy for protein-RNA binding prediction, making this approach widely accessible to researchers with limited computing resources.

Abstract: Large Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models have demonstrated success in various domains, including general text and image generation, drug discovery, and protein-RNA (ribonucleic acid) binding tasks. However, these models typically demand substantial computational resources, time, and data for effective training. Given that such extensive resources are often inaccessible to many researchers and that life sciences data sets are frequently limited, we investigated whether small ANN models could achieve acceptable accuracy in protein-RNA prediction. We experimented with shallow feed-forward ANNs comprising two hidden layers and various non-linearities. These models did not utilize explicit structural information; instead, a sliding window approach was employed to implicitly consider the context of neighboring residues and bases. We explored different training techniques to address the issue of highly unbalanced data. Among the seven most popular non-linearities for feed-forward ANNs, only three: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Gated Linear Unit (GLU), and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) yielded converging models. Common re-balancing techniques, such as under- and over-sampling of training sets, proved ineffective, whereas increasing the volume of training data and using model ensembles significantly improved performance. The optimal context window size, balancing both false negative and false positive errors, was found to be approximately 30 residues and bases. Our findings indicate that high-accuracy protein-RNA binding prediction is achievable using computing hardware accessible to most educational and research institutions.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper introduces MicroEvoEval, the first benchmark for microstructure evolution prediction, evaluating 14 models for both numerical and physical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gaps in microstructure evolution simulation benchmarks, such as the lack of standardized comparisons and balanced focus on numerical accuracy and physical fidelity.

Method: MicroEvoEval benchmarks 14 models, focusing on four MicroEvo tasks, structured for short- and long-term analysis, and incorporates structure-preserving metrics.

Result: Modern architectures like VMamba were found to offer superior long-term stability, physical fidelity, and efficiency, outperforming traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Holistic evaluation frameworks are crucial, and modern architectures are promising for developing efficient surrogate models in materials science.

Abstract: Simulating microstructure evolution (MicroEvo) is vital for materials design but demands high numerical accuracy, efficiency, and physical fidelity. Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science.

Motivation: Address challenges like stagnation and instability in solving parametric nonlinear systems using Newton's method, especially under unbalanced nonlinearities.

Method: Developed a fixed-point neural operator (FPNO) integrating negative step sizes, unlike traditional Newton-based algorithms, for robust computation amid strong nonlinearities.

Result: Experiments show NP-Newton's efficiency and robustness across diverse real-world nonlinear applications amidst strong nonlinearities.

Conclusion: NP-Newton improves computational performance and stability in nonlinear systems using machine learning techniques like FPNO.

Abstract: We propose a novel neural preconditioned Newton (NP-Newton) method for solving parametric nonlinear systems of equations. To overcome the stagnation or instability of Newton iterations caused by unbalanced nonlinearities, we introduce a fixed-point neural operator (FPNO) that learns the direct mapping from the current iterate to the solution by emulating fixed-point iterations. Unlike traditional line-search or trust-region algorithms, the proposed FPNO adaptively employs negative step sizes to effectively mitigate the effects of unbalanced nonlinearities. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate the computational efficiency and robustness of the proposed NP-Newton method across multiple real-world applications, especially for very strong nonlinearities.

Retrospective validation demonstrated autonomous identification of high-risk targets including FcRH5 (hepatotoxicity) and CD229 (off-tumor toxicity), patent infringement risks for CD38+SLAMF7 combinations, and generation of comprehensive development roadmaps. By enabling parallel processing, specialized reasoning, and autonomous decision-making superior to monolithic AI systems, Bio AI Agent addresses critical gaps in precision oncology development and has potential to accelerate translation of next-generation immunotherapies from discovery to clinic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of intrinsic randomness and high overhead due to repeated executions in quantum model predictions for machine learning and classification tasks.

Method: Development of a novel measurement strategy enabling near-deterministic predictions for variational quantum classifiers, validated through theoretical modeling and experimental results.

Result: The proposed strategy enables significantly fewer quantum circuit executions with competitive classification accuracy in noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical trade-off reducing performance slightly but achieving improved resource efficiency in quantum classification tasks.

Abstract: Quantum computing promises a revolution in information processing, with significant potential for machine learning and classification tasks. However, achieving this potential requires overcoming several fundamental challenges. One key limitation arises at the prediction stage, where the intrinsic randomness of quantum model outputs necessitates repeated executions, resulting in substantial overhead. To overcome this, we propose a novel measurement strategy for a variational quantum classifier that allows us to define the unambiguous quantum classifier. This strategy achieves near-deterministic predictions while maintaining competitive classification accuracy in noisy environments, all with significantly fewer quantum circuit executions. Although this approach entails a slight reduction in performance, it represents a favorable trade-off for improved resource efficiency. We further validate our theoretical model with supporting experimental results.

*Shuli Zeng,Sijia Zhang,Feng Wu,Shaojie Tang,Xiang-Yang Li*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a decomposition framework to integrate deep neural networks into mixed-integer programming, achieving scalability and modularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedding neural networks into mixed-integer programs enhances decision-making capabilities but existing methods are inefficient and intractable.

Method: A dual-decomposition framework is introduced that splits the problem into a standard MIP and a constrained neural network subproblem, applying solvers specialized for each component to improve efficiency and scalability.

Result: The method is highly scalable (120x faster than baseline), modular (supports flexible NN sub-solvers), and adaptable (handles different neural architectures without performance loss).

Conclusion: This framework substantially improves the tractability of embedding neural networks into MIPs, offering significant efficiency and flexibility advantages.

Abstract: Embedding deep neural networks (NNs) into mixed-integer programs (MIPs) is attractive for decision making with learned constraints, yet state-of-the-art monolithic linearisations blow up in size and quickly become intractable. In this paper, we introduce a novel dual-decomposition framework that relaxes the single coupling equality u=x with an augmented Lagrange multiplier and splits the problem into a vanilla MIP and a constrained NN block. Each part is tackled by the solver that suits it best-branch and cut for the MIP subproblem, first-order optimisation for the NN subproblem-so the model remains modular, the number of integer variables never grows with network depth, and the per-iteration cost scales only linearly with the NN size. On the public \textsc{SurrogateLIB} benchmark, our method proves \textbf{scalable}, \textbf{modular}, and \textbf{adaptable}: it runs \(120\times\) faster than an exact Big-M formulation on the largest test case; the NN sub-solver can be swapped from a log-barrier interior step to a projected-gradient routine with no code changes and identical objective value; and swapping the MLP for an LSTM backbone still completes the full optimisation in 47s without any bespoke adaptation.

*Shreyas Bharadwaj,Bamdev Mishra,Cyrus Mostajeran,Alberto Padoan,Jeremy Coulson,Ravi N. Banavar*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper presents a new approach to solving least-squares problems using geometric robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical least-squares methods may fail under uncertainties. This paper is motivated by the need to handle robust least-squares optimization in a geometrically sound manner.

Method: The authors introduce a min-max optimization model on the Grassmannian manifold to represent uncertainty in geometric relations. They derive a closed-form solution for the inner maximization and develop an efficient algorithm.

Result: The new method strengthens robustness in least-squares problems and demonstrates better scalability with small uncertainty. It is tested in applications like data-enabled predictive control.

Conclusion: This robust least-squares approach provides geometric transparency and improves performance under uncertainty compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The paper studies a geometrically robust least-squares problem that extends classical and norm-based robust formulations. Rather than minimizing residual error for fixed or perturbed data, we interpret least-squares as enforcing approximate subspace inclusion between measured and true data spaces. The uncertainty in this geometric relation is modeled as a metric ball on the Grassmannian manifold, leading to a min-max problem over Euclidean and manifold variables. The inner maximization admits a closed-form solution, enabling an efficient algorithm with a transparent geometric interpretation. Applied to robust finite-horizon linear-quadratic tracking in data-enabled predictive control, the method improves upon existing robust least-squares formulations, achieving stronger robustness and favorable scaling under small uncertainty.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model for parking lot managers to utilize parked EV batteries as robust virtual energy storage services under uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for reliable and robust energy storage solutions using parked EV batteries while managing uncertainties like EV departures and state-of-charge limits.

Method: The proposed method involves a scenario-based convex optimization problem using Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets, incorporating robust constraint satisfaction and tunable trade-offs between profit and risk.

Result: The model delivers certified safety for out-of-sample constraints and shows robustness against distributional challenges, backed by numerical validation.

Conclusion: The proposed optimization model effectively demonstrates its ability to provide robust virtual energy services with efficient constraint satisfaction, confirming its practical viability.

Abstract: We propose an optimization model where a parking lot manager (PLM) can aggregate parked EV batteries to provide virtual energy storage services that are provably robust under uncertain EV departures and state-of-charge caps. Our formulation yields a data-driven convex optimization problem where a prosumer community agrees on a contract with the PLM for the provision of storage services over a finite horizon. Leveraging recent results in the scenario approach, we certify out-of-sample constraint safety. Furthermore, we enable a tunable profit-risk trade-off through scenario relaxation and extend our model to account for robustness to adversarial perturbations and distributional shifts over Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets. All the approaches are accompanied by tight finite-sample certificates. Numerical studies demonstrate the out-of-sample and out-of-distribution constraint satisfaction of our proposed model compared to the developed theoretical guarantees, showing their effectiveness and potential in robust and efficient virtual energy services.

*Addison Kalanther,Daniel Bostwick,Chinmay Maheshwari,Shankar Sastry*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic algorithm for a pursuit-evasion game involving UAVs in urban environments using bounded rationality and reinforcement learning, resulting in improved performance against random evaders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle pursuit-evasion scenarios where limited visibility, urban occlusion, and lack of information about the evader make tracking and interception challenging.

Method: A two-phase algorithm: offline reinforcement learning generates adversarial policies representing levels of rationality; online classification selects the best response based on these trained policies to deal with the current evader.

Result: Improved average performance for UAV pursuers when facing random evaders in an urban environment.

Conclusion: The neuro-symbolic approach demonstrates the utility of integrating deep reinforcement learning and online classification for improving strategies in complex pursuit-evasion dynamics.

Abstract: We consider a scenario where a team of two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) pursue an evader UAV within an urban environment. Each agent has a limited view of their environment where buildings can occlude their field-of-view. Additionally, the pursuer team is agnostic about the evader in terms of its initial and final location, and the behavior of the evader. Consequently, the team needs to gather information by searching the environment and then track it to eventually intercept. To solve this multi-player, partially-observable, pursuit-evasion game, we develop a two-phase neuro-symbolic algorithm centered around the principle of bounded rationality. First, we devise an offline approach using deep reinforcement learning to progressively train adversarial policies for the pursuer team against fictitious evaders. This creates $k$-levels of rationality for each agent in preparation for the online phase. Then, we employ an online classification algorithm to determine a "best guess" of our current opponent from the set of iteratively-trained strategic agents and apply the best player response. Using this schema, we improved average performance when facing a random evader in our environment.

*Romain Cosentino,Sarath Shekkizhar,Adam Earle*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The study explores agent interactions in multi-agent systems using language models, highlighting biased equilibrium, misaligned objectives, and conditions for asymmetric convergence, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve agent-to-agent language model interactions, specifically regarding stability, bias, and robustness in multi-agent systems.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework analyzing iterative gradient updates between agents with different objectives. Investigations include mathematical characterization of dynamics and designed an algorithm ensuring adversarial success in asymmetric setups.

Result: Proved existence of biased equilibrium due to misaligned objectives, established conditions for asymmetric convergence, and experimentally validated theories with transformer models and GPT-5.

Conclusion: The framework connects prompt design and interaction setup to system stability, bias, and robustness, offering tools to predict and defend multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for agent-to-agent interactions in multi-agent scenarios. We consider the setup in which two language model based agents perform iterative gradient updates toward their respective objectives in-context, using the output of the other agent as input. We characterize the generation dynamics associated with the interaction when the agents have misaligned objectives, and show that this results in a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target - with the residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the geometry induced by the prompt of each agent. We establish the conditions for asymmetric convergence and provide an algorithm that provably achieves an adversarial result, producing one-sided success. Experiments with trained transformer models as well as GPT$5$ for the task of in-context linear regression validate the theory. Our framework presents a setup to study, predict, and defend multi-agent systems; explicitly linking prompt design and interaction setup to stability, bias, and robustness.

*Zhuhui Li,Chunbo Luo,Liming Huang,Luyu Qi,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of multi-agent multi-objective systems (MAMOS), proposing the AA-MAMORL framework that enhances performance by accessing global utilities while maintaining decentralized execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of training non-stationarity and effectively manage heterogeneous objectives and utility functions in multi-agent systems.

Method: The authors propose the AA-MAMORL framework, which learns joint beliefs on agents' utility functions and policies during centralized training and enables decentralized decision-making without inter-agent communication during execution.

Result: Experiments in custom MAMO Particle and MOMALand environments show the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by leveraging global utility functions.

Conclusion: The AA-MAMORL framework proves effective for handling decentralized multi-agent multi-objective systems, providing both theoretical and experimental validation for improved decision-making and optimization.

Abstract: Multi-agent multi-objective systems (MAMOS) have emerged as powerful frameworks for modelling complex decision-making problems across various real-world domains, such as robotic exploration, autonomous traffic management, and sensor network optimisation. MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced version of the PIBT solver for Multi-Agent Path Finding, addressing limitations in agents requiring significant orientation actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PIBT is fast but struggles with scenarios where agents need complex rotation actions, negatively affecting its performance.

Method: The authors modified PIBT to support multi-action operations, enhancing its handling of time-consuming rotations while integrating graph-guidance techniques and large neighborhood search optimization.

Result: The enhanced PIBT achieves state-of-the-art performance in the online LMAPF-T setting, maintaining efficiency while improving in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The presented improvements make PIBT more effective in multi-agent path-finding scenarios involving orientation challenges without compromising speed and efficiency.

Abstract: PIBT is a rule-based Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) solver, widely used as a low-level planner or action sampler in many state-of-the-art approaches. Its primary advantage lies in its exceptional speed, enabling action selection for thousands of agents within milliseconds by considering only the immediate next timestep. However, this short-horizon design leads to poor performance in scenarios where agents have orientation and must perform time-consuming rotation actions. In this work, we present an enhanced version of PIBT that addresses this limitation by incorporating multi-action operations. We detail the modifications introduced to improve PIBT's performance while preserving its hallmark efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our method, when combined with graph-guidance technique and large neighborhood search optimization, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the online LMAPF-T setting.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: This paper presents a model-free computational approach to detect RNA modifications using nanopore sequencing, treating it as an anomaly detection task based on robust features from current signal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RNA modification detection techniques are limited by biases from reverse transcription, RNA fragmentation, and constraints of computational tools that require prior training on modification data.

Method: The authors propose a method reframing modification detection as anomaly detection, analyzing raw ionic current signals from nanopore sequencing with signature transform features, and scoring anomalies against unmodified RNA datasets.

Result: The method successfully identified diverse RNA modifications in known cases (E. coli rRNA), including a novel modification site in DENV sfRNA validated with qRT-PCR assays.

Conclusion: This approach operates effectively across RNA types and sequencing chemistries, providing a robust, training-free tool for RNA modification detection.

Abstract: Detecting chemical modifications on RNA molecules remains a key challenge in epitranscriptomics. Traditional reverse transcription-based sequencing methods introduce enzyme- and sequence-dependent biases and fragment RNA molecules, confounding the accurate mapping of modifications across the transcriptome. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing offers a powerful alternative by preserving native RNA molecules, enabling the detection of modifications at single-molecule resolution. However, current computational tools can identify only a limited subset of modification types within well-characterized sequence contexts for which ample training data exists. Here, we introduce a model-free computational method that reframes modification detection as an anomaly detection problem, requiring only canonical (unmodified) RNA reads without any other annotated data. For each nanopore read, our approach extracts robust, modification-sensitive features from the raw ionic current signal at a site using the signature transform, then computes an anomaly score by comparing the resulting feature vector to its nearest neighbors in an unmodified reference dataset. We convert anomaly scores into statistical p-values to enable anomaly detection at both individual read and site levels. Validation on densely-modified \textit{E. coli} rRNA demonstrates that our approach detects known sites harboring diverse modification types, without prior training on these modifications. We further applyied this framework to dengue virus (DENV) transcripts and mammalian mRNAs. For DENV sfRNA, it led to revealing a novel 2'-O-methylated site, which we validate orthogonally by qRT-PCR assays. These results demonstrate that our model-free approach operates robustly across different types of RNAs and datasets generated with different nanopore sequencing chemistries.

Conclusion: Deep VRegulome aids in functional analysis of non-coding regions, showcases survival-associated regulatory mutations, and provides tools for improved stratification based on non-coding signatures.

Abstract: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revealed numerous non-coding short variants whose functional impacts remain poorly understood. Despite recent advances in deep-learning genomic approaches, accurately predicting and prioritizing clinically relevant mutations in gene regulatory regions remains a major challenge. Here we introduce Deep VRegulome, a deep-learning method for prediction and interpretation of functionally disruptive variants in the human regulome, which combines 700 DNABERT fine-tuned models, trained on vast amounts of ENCODE gene regulatory regions, with variant scoring, motif analysis, attention-based visualization, and survival analysis. We showcase its application on TCGA glioblastoma WGS dataset in prioritizing survival-associated mutations and regulatory regions. The analysis identified 572 splice-disrupting and 9,837 transcription-factor binding site altering mutations occurring in greater than 10% of glioblastoma samples. Survival analysis linked 1352 mutations and 563 disrupted regulatory regions to patient outcomes, enabling stratification via non-coding mutation signatures.

*ZhenZhong Wang,Xin Zhang,Jun Liao,Min Jiang*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Interface Information-Aware Neural Operator (IANO) to improve accuracy in multiphase flow simulations by incorporating interface information as a physical prior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical solvers struggle with the computational complexity and heterogeneity of multiphase flows. Neural operators, while efficient, lack high-resolution accuracy in these systems due to spatial heterogeneity and limited quality training data.

Method: The proposed method, IANO, uses an interface-aware multiple function encoding mechanism to model physical fields and interfaces concurrently and a geometry-aware positional encoding mechanism to relate interface information, physical variables, and spatial positions.

Result: IANO achieves ~10% higher accuracy in multiphase flow simulations compared to baselines and shows robustness in low-data and noise-affected conditions.

Conclusion: IANO demonstrates effective and accurate multiphase flow predictions by incorporating physically-informed priors, showing promise for challenging computational scenarios.

Abstract: Multiphase flow systems, with their complex dynamics, field discontinuities, and interphase interactions, pose significant computational challenges for traditional numerical solvers. While neural operators offer efficient alternatives, they often struggle to achieve high-resolution numerical accuracy in these systems. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent spatial heterogeneity and the scarcity of high-quality training data in multiphase flows. In this work, we propose the Interface Information-Aware Neural Operator (IANO), a novel framework that explicitly leverages interface information as a physical prior to enhance the prediction accuracy. The IANO architecture introduces two key components: 1) An interface-aware multiple function encoding mechanism jointly models multiple physical fields and interfaces, thus capturing the high-frequency physical features at the interface. 2) A geometry-aware positional encoding mechanism further establishes the relationship between interface information, physical variables, and spatial positions, enabling it to achieve pointwise super-resolution prediction even in the low-data regimes. Experimental results demonstrate that IANO outperforms baselines by $\sim$10\% in accuracy for multiphase flow simulations while maintaining robustness under data-scarce and noise-perturbed conditions.

*Václav Kůla,Qipeng Kuang,Yuyi Wang,Yuanhong Wang,Ondřej Kuželka*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper provides a polynomial-time solution to a Weighted First-Order Model Counting Problem (WFOMC) with binary evidence on graphs of bounded treewidth, addressing computational barriers and showcasing efficiency through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the intractability of WFOMC problems with evidence by capitalizing on structural graph restrictions.

Method: They introduced a polynomial-time algorithm for WFOMC conditioned on binary evidence, restricted to graphs with bounded treewidth, for two-variable fragments FO^2 and C^2.

Result: The algorithm efficiently solves WFOMC problems under specified constraints and proves its applicability to combinatorial problems such as stable seating arrangements.

Conclusion: By restricting graph structure, the study ensures polynomial-time solutions for WFOMC with evidence, showing both theoretical advancement and practical scalability.

Abstract: The Weighted First-Order Model Counting Problem (WFOMC) asks to compute the weighted sum of models of a given first-order logic sentence over a given domain. Conditioning WFOMC on evidence -- fixing the truth values of a set of ground literals -- has been shown impossible in time polynomial in the domain size (unless $\mathsf{\#P \subseteq FP}$) even for fragments of logic that are otherwise tractable for WFOMC without evidence. In this work, we address the barrier by restricting the binary evidence to the case where the underlying Gaifman graph has bounded treewidth. We present a polynomial-time algorithm in the domain size for computing WFOMC for the two-variable fragments $\text{FO}^2$ and $\text{C}^2$ conditioned on such binary evidence. Furthermore, we show the applicability of our algorithm in combinatorial problems by solving the stable seating arrangement problem on bounded-treewidth graphs of bounded degree, which was an open problem. We also conducted experiments to show the scalability of our algorithm compared to the existing model counting solvers.

*Parsa Hedayatnia,Tina Tavakkoli,Hadi Amini,Mohammad Allahbakhsh,Haleh Amintoosi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new taxonomy for smart contract vulnerabilities based on program structure, presenting eight root-cause families and their mitigation examples, while cross-mapping with existing datasets to improve security practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart contracts often suffer from bugs leading to major losses, and existing tools fail to address vulnerabilities systematically or structurally.

Method: An attack-centric program-structure taxonomy is developed, unifying vulnerabilities into eight families with examples, exploit descriptions, mitigation strategies, and links to detection tools.

Result: The taxonomy enables better detection, reproducible audits, and improved security education, and reveals gaps in legacy datasets like SmartBugs and SolidiFI.

Conclusion: The taxonomy advances consistent vulnerability classification and practical security tools for researchers, auditors, and developers.

Abstract: Smart contracts concentrate high value assets and complex logic in small, immutable programs, where even minor bugs can cause major losses. Existing taxonomies and tools remain fragmented, organized around symptoms such as reentrancy rather than structural causes. This paper introduces an attack-centric, program-structure taxonomy that unifies Solidity vulnerabilities into eight root-cause families covering control flow, external calls, state integrity, arithmetic safety, environmental dependencies, access control, input validation, and cross-domain protocol assumptions. Each family is illustrated through concise Solidity examples, exploit mechanics, and mitigations, and linked to the detection signals observable by static, dynamic, and learning-based tools. We further cross-map legacy datasets (SmartBugs, SolidiFI) to this taxonomy to reveal label drift and coverage gaps. The taxonomy provides a consistent vocabulary and practical checklist that enable more interpretable detection, reproducible audits, and structured security education for both researchers and practitioners.

TL;DR: This paper identifies and investigates Signature Replay Vulnerabilities (SRVs) in smart contracts, introduces an automated detection tool LASiR using LLMs, and evaluates its performance across multiple blockchains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart contracts lack checks on signature usage conditions, leading to Signature Replay Vulnerabilities (SRVs) that pose risks to security and assets.

Method: The study analyzes 1,419 audit reports to classify SRVs, designs LASiR using LLM-based static taint analysis, symbolic execution, and conducts large-scale experiments on blockchain contracts.

Result: LASiR discovered SRVs in 19.63% of Ethereum contracts, affecting $4.76 million in assets, achieving an F1-score of 87.90% in detection.

Conclusion: SRVs are prevalent and impactful. LASiR demonstrates effective detection capabilities enhanced by LLM-informed semantic analysis.

Abstract: Smart contracts have significantly advanced blockchain technology, and digital signatures are crucial for reliable verification of contract authority. Through signature verification, smart contracts can ensure that signers possess the required permissions, thus enhancing security and scalability. However, lacking checks on signature usage conditions can lead to repeated verifications, increasing the risk of permission abuse and threatening contract assets. We define this issue as the Signature Replay Vulnerability (SRV). In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to investigate the causes and characteristics of the SRVs. From 1,419 audit reports across 37 blockchain security companies, we identified 108 with detailed SRV descriptions and classified five types of SRVs. To detect these vulnerabilities automatically, we designed LASiR, which utilizes the general semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the static taint analysis of the signature state and identify the signature reuse behavior. It also employs path reachability verification via symbolic execution to ensure effective and reliable detection. To evaluate the performance of LASiR, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15,383 contracts involving signature verification, selected from the initial dataset of 918,964 contracts across four blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The results indicate that SRVs are widespread, with affected contracts holding $4.76 million in active assets. Among these, 19.63% of contracts that use signatures on Ethereum contain SRVs. Furthermore, manual verification demonstrates that LASiR achieves an F1-score of 87.90% for detection. Ablation studies and comparative experiments reveal that the semantic information provided by LLMs aids static taint analysis, significantly enhancing LASiR's detection performance.

TL;DR: The paper validates the GeNIS dataset's efficacy for AI-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by reducing its dimensionality, training ML and DL models, and achieving high classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of cyberattacks' growing sophistication and the lack of diverse datasets for effective AI-based NIDS.

Method: The study employed five feature selection methods to reduce GeNIS dataset dimensionality, followed by training ML ensembles and DL models on binary and multiclass tasks.

Result: The models achieved high levels of accuracy and F1-scores, with ML ensembles slightly outperforming DL models in generalization and efficiency.

Conclusion: The GeNIS dataset is validated as reliable for intelligent intrusion detection, proving its effectiveness in supporting cybersecurity classification tasks.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) is a promising approach to tackle the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks. However, since Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models rely heavily on the quality of their training data, the lack of diverse and up-to-date datasets hinders their generalization capability to detect malicious activity in previously unseen network traffic. This study presents an experimental validation of the reliability of the GeNIS dataset for AI-based NIDS, to serve as a baseline for future benchmarks. Five feature selection methods, Information Gain, Chi-Squared Test, Recursive Feature Elimination, Mean Absolute Deviation, and Dispersion Ratio, were combined to identify the most relevant features of GeNIS and reduce its dimensionality, enabling a more computationally efficient detection. Three decision tree ensembles and two deep neural networks were trained for both binary and multiclass classification tasks. All models reached high accuracy and F1-scores, and the ML ensembles achieved slightly better generalization while remaining more efficient than DL models. Overall, the obtained results indicate that the GeNIS dataset supports intelligent intrusion detection and cyberattack classification with time-based and quantity-based behavioral features.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: iSeal is a novel fingerprinting method for LLM ownership verification designed to resist attacks, achieving 100% success under multiple challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safeguarding intellectual property of LLMs is critical given their high training cost and vulnerability to theft or misuse.

Method: iSeal injects unique features into both the LLM and an external module, supported by error correction and similarity-based verification to counter verification-time attacks.

Result: Empirical and theoretical analysis show iSeal achieving 100% fingerprint success rate on 12 LLMs against over 10 different attacks.

Conclusion: iSeal is a reliable and robust mechanism for LLM fingerprinting, outperforming existing methods in scenarios where attackers control the LLM processes.

Abstract: Given the high cost of large language model (LLM) training from scratch, safeguarding LLM intellectual property (IP) has become increasingly crucial. As the standard paradigm for IP ownership verification, LLM fingerprinting thus plays a vital role in addressing this challenge. Existing LLM fingerprinting methods verify ownership by extracting or injecting model-specific features. However, they overlook potential attacks during the verification process, leaving them ineffective when the model thief fully controls the LLM's inference process. In such settings, attackers may share prompt-response pairs to enable fingerprint unlearning or manipulate outputs to evade exact-match verification. We propose iSeal, the first fingerprinting method designed for reliable verification when the model thief controls the suspected LLM in an end-to-end manner. It injects unique features into both the model and an external module, reinforced by an error-correction mechanism and a similarity-based verification strategy. These components are resistant to verification-time attacks, including collusion-based fingerprint unlearning and response manipulation, backed by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. iSeal achieves 100 percent Fingerprint Success Rate (FSR) on 12 LLMs against more than 10 attacks, while baselines fail under unlearning and response manipulations.

*Taifeng Liu,Xinjing Liu,Liangqiu Dong,Yang Liu,Yilong Yang,Zhuo Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAE to sustain adversarial examples against domain drift in Class-Incremental Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial examples often fail in Class-Incremental Learning settings due to domain drift, necessitating more sustainable adversarial examples.

Method: The proposed SAE includes a Semantic Correction Module leveraging universal semantics and a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module to stabilize AE semantics.

Result: SAE improved adversarial example performance by 31.28% on average, even with a significant increase in class updates.

Conclusion: SAE successfully enhances the sustainability and robustness of adversarial examples against domain drift in dynamic Class-Incremental Learning models.

Abstract: Current adversarial examples (AEs) are typically designed for static models. However, with the wide application of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), models are no longer static and need to be updated with new data distributed and labeled differently from the old ones. As a result, existing AEs often fail after CIL updates due to significant domain drift. In this paper, we propose SAE to enhance the sustainability of AEs against CIL. The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAE outperforms baselines by an average of 31.28% when updated with a 9-fold increase in the number of classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of privacy mechanisms in MCDM methods, especially in dynamic and sensitive data-driven domains.

Method: Introduce a preprocessing step combining MCDM outranking methods with DP that aggregates user evaluations into a secure performance matrix.

Result: Achieved high statistical correlation between true rankings and anonymized versions while ensuring robust privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: The combined MCDM-DP approach effectively safeguards sensitive information without compromising decision accuracy.

Abstract: Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a sub-discipline of Operations Research that helps decision-makers in choosing, ranking, or sorting alternatives based on conflicting criteria. Over time, its application has been expanded into dynamic and data-driven domains, such as recommender systems. In these contexts, the availability and handling of personal and sensitive data can play a critical role in the decision-making process. Despite this increased reliance on sensitive data, the integration of privacy mechanisms with MCDM methods is underdeveloped. This paper introduces an integrated approach that combines MCDM outranking methods with Differential Privacy (DP), safeguarding individual contributions' privacy in ranking problems. This approach relies on a pre-processing step to aggregate multiple user evaluations into a comprehensive performance matrix. The evaluation results show a strong to very strong statistical correlation between the true rankings and their anonymized counterparts, ensuring robust privacy parameter guarantees.

Method: The methodology parses gate-level designs into graphs, uses SCOAP metrics for rare region identification, and applies graph transformations to synthesize realistic trigger-payload patterns while maintaining functionality.

Result: State-of-the-art graph-learning detection tools failed to identify Trojans on benchmarks generated by the framework, highlighting its effectiveness and setting new evaluation challenges.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between academic circuits and real-world SoC security evaluation, advancing the field while avoiding ethical risks by not sharing malicious attack steps.

Abstract: Industrial Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) often comprise hundreds of thousands to millions of nets and millions to tens of millions of connectivity edges, making empirical evaluation of hardware-Trojan (HT) detectors on realistic designs both necessary and difficult. Public benchmarks remain significantly smaller and hand-crafted, while releasing truly malicious RTL raises ethical and operational risks. This work presents an automated and scalable methodology for generating HT-like patterns in industry-scale netlists whose purpose is to stress-test detection tools without altering user-visible functionality. The pipeline (i) parses large gate-level designs into connectivity graphs, (ii) explores rare regions using SCOAP testability metrics, and (iii) applies parameterized, function-preserving graph transformations to synthesize trigger-payload pairs that mimic the statistical footprint of stealthy HTs. When evaluated on the benchmarks generated in this work, representative state-of-the-art graph-learning models fail to detect Trojans. The framework closes the evaluation gap between academic circuits and modern SoCs by providing reproducible challenge instances that advance security research without sharing step-by-step attack instructions.

### [364] [Unveiling Hidden Threats: Using Fractal Triggers to Boost Stealthiness of Distributed Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09252)
*Jian Wang,Hong Shen,Chan-Tong Lam*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Fractal-Triggered Distributed Backdoor Attack (FTDBA) to improve stealth and efficiency of attacks in federated learning by using fractal features, reducing the need for poisoned data and detection risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional distributed backdoor attacks require a significant amount of poisoned data to maintain attack strength, increasing exposure risks. There is a need for a low-exposure, high-efficiency attack method.

Method: The method employs fractal structures to strengthen the sub-triggers' features, reducing poisoned data requirements. It incorporates dynamic angular perturbation to balance stealth and efficiency during training phases.

Result: FTDBA achieves a 92.3% attack success rate using only 62.4% of the poisoning volume of traditional methods. It lowers detection rate by 22.8% and KL divergence by 41.2%.

Conclusion: FTDBA offers an innovative and effective approach for stealthy and efficient distributed backdoor attacks in federated learning by leveraging fractal features, advancing adversarial sample creation and increasing attack robustness.

Abstract: Traditional distributed backdoor attacks (DBA) in federated learning improve stealthiness by decomposing global triggers into sub-triggers, which however requires more poisoned data to maintian the attck strength and hence increases the exposure risk. To overcome this defect, This paper proposes a novel method, namely Fractal-Triggerred Distributed Backdoor Attack (FTDBA), which leverages the self-similarity of fractals to enhance the feature strength of sub-triggers and hence significantly reduce the required poisoning volume for the same attack strength. To address the detectability of fractal structures in the frequency and gradient domains, we introduce a dynamic angular perturbation mechanism that adaptively adjusts perturbation intensity across the training phases to balance efficiency and stealthiness. Experiments show that FTDBA achieves a 92.3\% attack success rate with only 62.4\% of the poisoning volume required by traditional DBA methods, while reducing the detection rate by 22.8\% and KL divergence by 41.2\%. This study presents a low-exposure, high-efficiency paradigm for federated backdoor attacks and expands the application of fractal features in adversarial sample generation.

*Yunfei Yang,Xiaojun Chen,Yuexin Xuan,Zhendong Zhao,Xin Zhao,He Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepTracer, a robust watermarking framework designed to protect AI models from theft and unauthorized use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking techniques fail under model-stealing attacks, making it hard for owners to prove model ownership effectively.

Method: The authors developed DeepTracer, which uses a novel watermark sample construction method, coupling loss constraint, and a key sample filtering mechanism for stronger verification.

Result: DeepTracer achieves superior resistance against model-stealing and watermark attacks, outperforming current methods across multiple datasets and models.

Conclusion: DeepTracer provides a robust and effective approach for model watermarking and ownership verification, setting a new standard in the field.

Abstract: Model watermarking techniques can embed watermark information into the protected model for ownership declaration by constructing specific input-output pairs. However, existing watermarks are easily removed when facing model stealing attacks, and make it difficult for model owners to effectively verify the copyright of stolen models. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of the failure of current watermarking methods under model stealing scenarios and then explore potential solutions. Specifically, we introduce a robust watermarking framework, DeepTracer, which leverages a novel watermark samples construction method and a same-class coupling loss constraint. DeepTracer can incur a high-coupling model between watermark task and primary task that makes adversaries inevitably learn the hidden watermark task when stealing the primary task functionality. Furthermore, we propose an effective watermark samples filtering mechanism that elaborately select watermark key samples used in model ownership verification to enhance the reliability of watermarks. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in defending against various model stealing attacks, as well as watermark attacks, and achieves new state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness.

*Muhammed El Mustaqeem Mazelan,Noor Hazlina Abdul,Nouar AlDahoul*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a password strength scoring system using machine learning, outperforming traditional methods and providing actionable feedback to enhance cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortcomings of traditional password strength meters, which are easily bypassed, providing users with a false sense of security.

Method: The authors implement and evaluate four machine learning models (RF, SVM, CNN, Logistic Regression) while introducing novel hybrid feature engineering techniques using a dataset of 660,000 passwords.

Result: The Random Forest model achieved superior performance with 99.12% accuracy and provides actionable insights into password vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The study presents a practical and highly accurate system for scoring password strengths, bridging predictive capabilities and usability to reduce vulnerabilities and empower users.

Abstract: Password security plays a crucial role in cybersecurity, yet traditional password strength meters, which rely on static rules like character-type requirements, often fail. Such methods are easily bypassed by common password patterns (e.g., 'P@ssw0rd1!'), giving users a false sense of security. To address this, we implement and evaluate a password strength scoring system by comparing four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Logistic Regression with a dataset of over 660,000 real-world passwords. Our primary contribution is a novel hybrid feature engineering approach that captures nuanced vulnerabilities missed by standard metrics. We introduce features like leetspeak-normalized Shannon entropy to assess true randomness, pattern detection for keyboard walks and sequences, and character-level TF-IDF n-grams to identify frequently reused substrings from breached password datasets. our RF model achieved superior performance, achieving 99.12% accuracy on a held-out test set. Crucially, the interpretability of the Random Forest model allows for feature importance analysis, providing a clear pathway to developing security tools that offer specific, actionable feedback to users. This study bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and practical usability, resulting in a high-performance scoring system that not only reduces password-based vulnerabilities but also empowers users to make more informed security decisions.

### [367] [Generalisable prediction model of surgical case duration: multicentre development and temporal validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08994)
*Daijiro Kabata,Mari Ito,Tokito Koga,Kazuma Yunoki*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This study evaluated a stacked machine-learning model for predicting surgical case durations using multicenter data, achieving accurate, generalizable predictions across sites and time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations of existing surgical duration prediction models, which often rely on site- or surgeon-specific inputs and lack external validation, making them less generalizable.

Method: A retrospective multicenter study was conducted, utilizing perioperative data and preoperative predictors with multiple machine-learning methods (elastic-net, generalized additive models, random forest, gradient-boosted trees) combined via stacked generalization. Internal-external cross-validation was applied for robust validation.

Result: The model analyzed 63,206 procedures and demonstrated consistent, well-calibrated performance across centers and years, with good calibration metrics in an independent 2024 temporal test cohort.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of a general-purpose stacked machine-learning model for predicting surgical case durations using commonly available preoperative variables, enabling better operating room scheduling and generalizability across settings.

Abstract: Background: Accurate prediction of surgical case duration underpins operating room (OR) scheduling, yet existing models often depend on site- or surgeon-specific inputs and rarely undergo external validation, limiting generalisability.
  Methods: We undertook a retrospective multicentre study using routinely collected perioperative data from two general hospitals in Japan (development: 1 January 2021-31 December 2023; temporal test: 1 January-31 December 2024). Elective weekday procedures with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status 1-4 were included. Pre-specified preoperative predictors comprised surgical context (year, month, weekday, scheduled duration, general anaesthesia indicator, body position) and patient factors (sex, age, body mass index, allergy, infection, comorbidity, ASA). Missing data were addressed by multiple imputation by chained equations. Four learners (elastic-net, generalised additive models, random forest, gradient-boosted trees) were tuned within internal-external cross-validation (IECV; leave-one-cluster-out by centre-year) and combined by stacked generalisation to predict log-transformed duration.
  Results: We analysed 63,206 procedures (development 45,647; temporal test 17,559). Cluster-specific and pooled errors and calibrations from IECV are provided with consistent performance across centres and years. In the 2024 temporal test cohort, calibration was good (intercept 0.423, 95%CI 0.372 to 0.474; slope 0.921, 95%CI 0.911 to 0.932).
  Conclusions: A stacked machine-learning model using only widely available preoperative variables achieved accurate, well-calibrated predictions in temporal external validation, supporting transportability across sites and over time. Such general-purpose tools may improve OR scheduling without relying on idiosyncratic inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a resilient system for fault detection in multi-spacecraft collaborative missions, enhancing autonomous operation and reliability.

Method: A global-to-local task-aware framework integrates a cost function for guidance, control, and fault detection. Faults are identified through task metrics and higher-order cost-gradient measures with adaptive thresholding.

Result: Simulation results validate reliable fault localization and classification in multi-spacecraft scenarios under uncertainty.

Conclusion: This framework offers a robust approach for resilient autonomous inspection architectures in multi-spacecraft systems.

Abstract: This work presents a global-to-local, task-aware fault detection and identification (FDI) framework for multi-spacecraft systems conducting collaborative inspection missions in low Earth orbit. The inspection task is represented by a global information-driven cost functional that integrates the sensor model, spacecraft poses, and mission-level information-gain objectives. This formulation links guidance, control, and FDI by using the same cost function to drive both global task allocation and local sensing or motion decisions. Fault detection is achieved through comparisons between expected and observed task metrics, while higher-order cost-gradient measures enable the identification of faults among sensors, actuators, and state estimators. An adaptive thresholding mechanism captures the time-varying inspection geometry and dynamic mission conditions. Simulation results for representative multi-spacecraft inspection scenarios demonstrate the reliability of fault localization and classification under uncertainty, providing a unified, information-driven foundation for resilient autonomous inspection architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of propagating uncertainty in nonlinear system state estimation, especially via neural networks.

Method: Utilizes a recent analytic formula to compute the mean and covariance of deep neural networks with Gaussian input, and proposes cross entropy as a performance metric.

Result: Demonstrates improved accuracy for state estimation on stochastic systems and better linear quadratic regulation performance.

Conclusion: The approach enhances uncertainty propagation and leads to superior state estimation and control outcomes in nonlinear systems.

Abstract: The Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother are optimal for state estimation in linear dynamic systems. With nonlinear systems, the challenge consists in how to propagate uncertainty through the state transitions and output function. For the case of a neural network model, we enable accurate uncertainty propagation using a recent state-of-the-art analytic formula for computing the mean and covariance of a deep neural network with Gaussian input. We argue that cross entropy is a more appropriate performance metric than RMSE for evaluating the accuracy of filters and smoothers. We demonstrate the superiority of our method for state estimation on a stochastic Lorenz system and a Wiener system, and find that our method enables more optimal linear quadratic regulation when the state estimate is used for feedback.

*Samuel Bilson,Andrew Thompson,Declan Tucker,Jonathan Pearce*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper discusses a machine learning-based method to address calibration drift in thermocouples using self-validating models with a focus on recognizing melting plateaus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermocouples often suffer from calibration drift in harsh environments, causing reliability issues that require improved and automated calibration processes.

Method: The researchers propose a novel machine learning approach for detecting the melting plateaus in fixed-point thermocouples, automating the characterization and onset identification of the melting process.

Result: Their method achieved 100% accuracy in detecting melting plateaus and demonstrated a cross-validated R2 of 0.99, indicating strong predictive capability for calibration drift.

Conclusion: Replacing manual intervention with a machine learning algorithm can enhance the reliability and efficiency of thermocouple calibration in industrial settings.

Abstract: Thermocouples are in widespread use in industry, but they are particularly susceptible to calibration drift in harsh environments. Self-validating thermocouples aim to address this issue by using a miniature phase-change cell (fixed-point) in close proximity to the measurement junction (tip) of the thermocouple. The fixed point is a crucible containing an ingot of metal with a known melting temperature. When the process temperature being monitored passes through the melting temperature of the ingot, the thermocouple output exhibits a "plateau" during melting. Since the melting temperature of the ingot is known, the thermocouple can be recalibrated in situ. Identifying the melting plateau to determine the onset of melting is reasonably well established but requires manual intervention involving zooming in on the region around the actual melting temperature, a process which can depend on the shape of the melting plateau. For the first time, we present a novel machine learning approach to recognize and identify the characteristic shape of the melting plateau and once identified, to quantity the point at which melting begins, along with its associated uncertainty. This removes the need for human intervention in locating and characterizing the melting point. Results from test data provided by CCPI Europe show 100% accuracy of melting plateau detection. They also show a cross-validated R2 of 0.99 on predictions of calibration drift.

*Zakhar Shumaylov,Peter Zaika,Philipp Scholl,Gitta Kutyniok,Lior Horesh,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper discusses the role of chaos in ensuring the discoverability of systems from observational data. Chaotic systems are easier to identify due to their mathematical characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of non-uniqueness in learned models from observational data, which undermines their predictive power. The study investigates conditions for reliably identifying governing equations.

Method: The authors explore the discoverability of systems through chaos by analyzing continuous and analytic functions. They assess benchmarks like the Lorenz system and examine geometric conditions on strange attractors.

Result: They find that chaos facilitates the analytical discoverability of systems, such as the Lorenz system. Non-chaotic systems require added physical knowledge to ensure reliable identification.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of chaos for model reliability in data-driven discovery while underscoring challenges for stable engineering systems where chaos is absent.

Abstract: The deep learning revolution has spurred a rise in advances of using AI in sciences. Within physical sciences the main focus has been on discovery of dynamical systems from observational data. Yet the reliability of learned surrogates and symbolic models is often undermined by the fundamental problem of non-uniqueness. The resulting models may fit the available data perfectly, but lack genuine predictive power. This raises the question: under what conditions can the systems governing equations be uniquely identified from a finite set of observations? We show, counter-intuitively, that chaos, typically associated with unpredictability, is crucial for ensuring a system is discoverable in the space of continuous or analytic functions. The prevalence of chaotic systems in benchmark datasets may have inadvertently obscured this fundamental limitation.
  More concretely, we show that systems chaotic on their entire domain are discoverable from a single trajectory within the space of continuous functions, and systems chaotic on a strange attractor are analytically discoverable under a geometric condition on the attractor. As a consequence, we demonstrate for the first time that the classical Lorenz system is analytically discoverable. Moreover, we establish that analytic discoverability is impossible in the presence of first integrals, common in real-world systems. These findings help explain the success of data-driven methods in inherently chaotic domains like weather forecasting, while revealing a significant challenge for engineering applications like digital twins, where stable, predictable behavior is desired. For these non-chaotic systems, we find that while trajectory data alone is insufficient, certain prior physical knowledge can help ensure discoverability. These findings warrant a critical re-evaluation of the fundamental assumptions underpinning purely data-driven discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial data systems struggle with scalability and real-time query handling for massive moving objects, necessitating an improved solution.

Method: The authors propose CheetahGIS, leveraging a modular architecture and optimizations like grid-based indexing, metadata synchronization, and load balancing to enhance system efficiency.

Result: CheetahGIS demonstrated effective handling of spatial queries (object query, range count query, k-nearest neighbor query) evaluated through experiments on real and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: CheetahGIS creates a scalable and optimized framework for streaming spatial query processing, with potential generalizability to diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Spatial data analytics systems are widely studied in both the academia and industry. However, existing systems are limited when handling a large number of moving objects and real time spatial queries. In this work, we architect a scalable and efficient system CheetahGIS to process streaming spatial queries over massive moving objects. In particular, CheetahGIS is built upon Apache Flink Stateful Functions (StateFun), an API for building distributed streaming applications with an actor-like model. CheetahGIS enjoys excellent scalability due to its modular architecture, which clearly decomposes different components and allows scaling individual components. To improve the efficiency and scalability of CheetahGIS, we devise a suite of optimizations, e.g., lightweight global grid-based index, metadata synchroniza tion strategies, and load balance mechanisms. We also formulate a generic paradigm for spatial query processing in CheetahGIS, and verify its generality by processing three representative streaming queries (i.e., object query, range count query, and k nearest neighbor query). We conduct extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets to evaluate CheetahGIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for spoken question answering struggle with processing long audio, and existing speech-related retrievers lack performance. Improving these retrievers is necessary to enhance long-form SQA.

Method: The proposed CLSR model incorporates a contrastive learning approach with an intermediate step that transforms acoustic signals into text-like representations before alignment.

Result: Experimental results on four cross-modal retrieval datasets show CLSR outperforms both end-to-end speech retrievers and pipeline methods combining speech-to-text and text retrieval.

Conclusion: CLSR demonstrates effectiveness in extracting question-relevant audio segments, advancing the practicality of long-form spoken question answering systems.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spoken question answering (SQA) in recent years. However, many existing methods, including large audio language models, struggle with processing long audio. Follow the success of retrieval augmented generation, a speech-related retriever shows promising in help preprocessing long-form speech. But the performance of existing speech-related retrievers is lacking. To address this challenge, we propose CLSR, an end-to-end contrastive language-speech retriever that efficiently extracts question-relevant segments from long audio recordings for downstream SQA task. Unlike conventional speech-text contrastive models, CLSR incorporates an intermediate step that converts acoustic features into text-like representations prior to alignment, thereby more effectively bridging the gap between modalities. Experimental results across four cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate that CLSR surpasses both end-to-end speech related retrievers and pipeline approaches combining speech recognition with text retrieval, providing a robust foundation for advancing practical long-form SQA applications.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diff-V2M, a framework for generating music from video using advanced techniques to address rhythm modeling and feature integration issues, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve video-to-music generation by addressing challenges in rhythm alignment between audio and visual content and effectively combining diverse visual features.

Method: The authors develop Diff-V2M, a hierarchical conditional diffusion model, incorporating rhythm, semantic, and emotional feature extraction with advanced cross-attention fusion strategies like FiLM and timestep-aware fusion.

Result: The proposed framework identifies low-resolution ODF as an optimal rhythmic representation and surpasses state-of-the-art models in both objective performance metrics and subjective user evaluations.

Conclusion: Diff-V2M successfully overcomes prior limitations in V2M systems, showcasing improvements in audiovisual alignment and quality of generated music.

Abstract: Video-to-music (V2M) generation aims to create music that aligns with visual content. However, two main challenges persist in existing methods: (1) the lack of explicit rhythm modeling hinders audiovisual temporal alignments; (2) effectively integrating various visual features to condition music generation remains non-trivial. To address these issues, we propose Diff-V2M, a general V2M framework based on a hierarchical conditional diffusion model, comprising two core components: visual feature extraction and conditional music generation. For rhythm modeling, we begin by evaluating several rhythmic representations, including low-resolution mel-spectrograms, tempograms, and onset detection functions (ODF), and devise a rhythmic predictor to infer them directly from videos. To ensure contextual and affective coherence, we also extract semantic and emotional features. All features are incorporated into the generator via a hierarchical cross-attention mechanism, where emotional features shape the affective tone via the first layer, while semantic and rhythmic features are fused in the second cross-attention layer. To enhance feature integration, we introduce timestep-aware fusion strategies, including feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) and weighted fusion, allowing the model to adaptively balance semantic and rhythmic cues throughout the diffusion process. Extensive experiments identify low-resolution ODF as a more effective signal for modeling musical rhythm and demonstrate that Diff-V2M outperforms existing models on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of objective metrics and subjective comparisons. Demo and code are available at https://Tayjsl97.github.io/Diff-V2M-Demo/.

Motivation: To improve the accuracy of extrapolating physical properties, like energies and radii, of light nuclei while addressing the limitations of finite model spaces in NCSM computations.

Method: Neural networks are used as computational tools to extrapolate NCSM results, leveraging data obtained with the Daejeon16 NN interaction across different model spaces and NCSM basis parameter values.

Result: Accurate predictions (within a few hundred keV) are achieved for ground-state energies and some excited states of light nuclei, while the convergence of radii for unbound states remains challenging.

Conclusion: The ensemble of neural networks effectively extrapolates NCSM results for bound states, although challenges remain for unbound state radii extrapolation, highlighting the method’s potential and limitations.

Abstract: An ensemble of neural networks is employed to extrapolate no-core shell model (NCSM) results to infinite model space for light nuclei. We present a review of our neural network extrapolations of the NCSM results obtained with the Daejeon16 NN interaction in different model spaces and with different values of the NCSM basis parameter $\hbarΩ$ for energies of nuclear states and root-mean-square (rms) radii of proton, neutron and matter distributions in light nuclei. The method yields convergent predictions with quantifiable uncertainties. Ground-state energies for $^{6}$Li, $^{6}$He, and the unbound $^{6}$Be, as well as the excited $(3^{+},0)$ and $(0^{+},1)$ states of $^{6}$Li, are obtained within a few hundred keV of experiment. The extrapolated radii of bound states converge well. In contrast, radii of unbound states in $^{6}$Be and $^{6}$Li do not stabilize.

Motivation: To improve the Segment Anything Model's performance in medical image segmentation, especially when only limited labeled data is available and hierarchical information is often overlooked.

Method: SAMora applies self-supervised learning objectives at image, patch, and pixel levels and introduces HL-Attn, a hierarchical fusion module that integrates multi-scale features.

Yet, its performance is limited when only a small amount of labeled data is available, while there is abundant valuable yet often overlooked hierarchical information in medical data. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from self-supervised learning and propose SAMora, an innovative framework that captures hierarchical medical knowledge by applying complementary self-supervised learning objectives at the image, patch, and pixel levels. To fully exploit the complementarity of hierarchical knowledge within LoRAs, we introduce HL-Attn, a hierarchical fusion module that integrates multi-scale features while maintaining their distinct characteristics. SAMora is compatible with various SAM variants, including SAM2, SAMed, and H-SAM. Experimental results on the Synapse, LA, and PROMISE12 datasets demonstrate that SAMora outperforms existing SAM variants. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot and fully supervised settings while reducing fine-tuning epochs by 90%. The code is available at https://github.com/ShChen233/SAMora.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of time consumption and dependence on planner expertise in conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fluence map optimization.

Method: The study implements a 3D Swin-UNETR deep learning model trained on 99 prostate IMRT cases to predict fluence maps directly from medical imaging and anatomical contours, evaluated using dose recalculations and statistical metrics in a treatment planning system.

Result: The model achieved high performance with an R^2 of 0.95, MAE of 0.035, and gamma passing rate of 85% with no significant deviations in dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters when compared to clinical plans.

Conclusion: The Swin-UNETR model offers a scalable and automated solution, delivering accurate and efficient fluence map predictions while avoiding conventional inverse optimization steps, thereby improving clinical workflows in IMRT.

Abstract: Accurate fluence map prediction is essential in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to maximize tumor coverage while minimizing dose to healthy tissues. Conventional optimization is time-consuming and dependent on planner expertise. This study presents a deep learning framework that accelerates fluence map generation while maintaining clinical quality. An end-to-end 3D Swin-UNETR network was trained to predict nine-beam fluence maps directly from volumetric CT images and anatomical contours using 99 prostate IMRT cases (79 for training and 20 for testing). The transformer-based model employs hierarchical self-attention to capture both local anatomical structures and long-range spatial dependencies. Predicted fluence maps were imported into the Eclipse Treatment Planning System for dose recalculation, and model performance was evaluated using beam-wise fluence correlation, spatial gamma analysis, and dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics. The proposed model achieved an average R^2 of 0.95 +/- 0.02, MAE of 0.035 +/- 0.008, and gamma passing rate of 85 +/- 10 percent (3 percent / 3 mm) on the test set, with no significant differences observed in DVH parameters between predicted and clinical plans. The Swin-UNETR framework enables fully automated, inverse-free fluence map prediction directly from anatomical inputs, enhancing spatial coherence, accuracy, and efficiency while offering a scalable and consistent solution for automated IMRT plan generation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel feature extraction method using persistent homology with structural MRI for Alzheimer's diagnosis, achieving high accuracy and sensitivity with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the approval of disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatments, there is a growing urgency for early, objective, and cost-effective diagnostic methods. This paper addresses the need for accurate AD diagnosis using low-cost, efficient machine learning techniques.

Method: The study uses persistent homology to extract topological features from brain structural MRI, which are transformed into feature vectors using Betti functions. These vectors are integrated into a simple machine learning model (XGBoost) to classify Alzheimer's disease stages.

Result: The proposed model achieved 97.43% average accuracy and 99.09% sensitivity in binary classification and 95.47% accuracy and 94.98% sensitivity in three-class classification, outperforming deep learning models without requiring data augmentation or preprocessing.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates that topological features derived from persistent homology can offer robust, computationally efficient diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, especially useful for small datasets. It also shows potential for integration with other models for enhanced diagnostic capabilities.

Abstract: Now that disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease have been approved by regulatory agencies, the early, objective, and accurate clinical diagnosis of AD based on the lowest-cost measurement modalities possible has become an increasingly urgent need. In this study, we propose a novel feature extraction method using persistent homology to analyze structural MRI of the brain. This approach converts topological features into powerful feature vectors through Betti functions. By integrating these feature vectors with a simple machine learning model like XGBoost, we achieve a computationally efficient machine learning model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in both binary and three-class classification tasks for ADNI 3D MRI disease diagnosis. Using 10-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an average accuracy of 97.43 percent and sensitivity of 99.09 percent for binary classification. For three-class classification, it achieved an average accuracy of 95.47 percent and sensitivity of 94.98 percent. Unlike many deep learning models, our approach does not require data augmentation or extensive preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for smaller datasets. Topological features differ significantly from those commonly extracted using convolutional filters and other deep learning machinery. Because it provides an entirely different type of information from machine learning models, it has the potential to combine topological features with other models later on.

*Kai Hu,Han Wang,Renhe Liu,Zhilin Li,Shenghui Song,Yu Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep ROI-based image compression method using implicit bit allocation, enhanced by novel modules and dual decoders, achieving superior compression and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compression methods using explicit bit allocation limits coding performance by disrupting entropy model distributions.

Method: Proposes a Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module for flexible bit allocation and dual decoders for separate foreground-background reconstruction.

Result: Experiments on COCO2017 dataset show superior rate-distortion performance compared to explicit methods, with good visual reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: This work advances ROI-based compression with implicit bit allocation, optimizing region-adaptive coding and visual quality.

Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression has rapidly developed due to its ability to maintain high fidelity in important regions while reducing data redundancy. However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize implicit bit allocation for high-quality regionadaptive coding. Experiments on the COCO2017 dataset show that our implicit-based image compression method significantly outperforms explicit bit allocation approaches in rate-distortion performance, achieving optimal results while maintaining satisfactory visual quality in the reconstructed background regions.

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing ultra-low-field MRI imaging using data augmentation and a deep model, achieving notable rankings in a challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-low-field MRI offers accessibility but suffers from limitations like low SNR and resolution. Overcoming these could make MRIs available to wider populations.

Method: The authors enhanced ULF MRI using task-adapted data augmentation and a standard deep model. Strong and diverse augmentations with auxiliary high-field tasks were emphasized.

Result: The team achieved third place by brain-masked SSIM in the public validation leaderboard and fourth place on the final test leaderboard.

Conclusion: Data augmentation strategies can substantially improve ULF MRI imaging, showing promise for making advanced imaging more accessible.

Abstract: Ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI promises broader accessibility but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduced spatial resolution, and contrasts that deviate from high-field standards. Image-to-image translation can map ULF images to a high-field appearance, yet efficacy is limited by scarce paired training data. Working within the ULF-EnC challenge constraints (50 paired 3D volumes; no external data), we study how task-adapted data augmentations impact a standard deep model for ULF image enhancement. We show that strong, diverse augmentations, including auxiliary tasks on high-field data, substantially improve fidelity. Our submission ranked third by brain-masked SSIM on the public validation leaderboard and fourth by the official score on the final test leaderboard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating the source nodes in information or infection spread on graphs with reliable statistical guarantees, applicable across various scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a conformal prediction framework using principled score functions and a calibration set to construct prediction sets with guarantees of recall and coverage.

Result: Empirical results show the method achieves high reliability and scalability, while outperforming existing baselines in accuracy and coverage validation.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust and efficient solution for detecting sources in network diffusion, supporting various dynamics and retaining reliability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Detecting the origin of information or infection spread in networks is a fundamental challenge with applications in misinformation tracking, epidemiology, and beyond. We study the multi-source detection problem: given snapshot observations of node infection status on a graph, estimate the set of source nodes that initiated the propagation. Existing methods either lack statistical guarantees or are limited to specific diffusion models and assumptions. We propose a novel conformal prediction framework that provides statistically valid recall guarantees for source set detection, independent of the underlying diffusion process or data distribution. Our approach introduces principled score functions to quantify the alignment between predicted probabilities and true sources, and leverages a calibration set to construct prediction sets with user-specified recall and coverage levels. The method is applicable to both single- and multi-source scenarios, supports general network diffusion dynamics, and is computationally efficient for large graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves rigorous coverage with competitive accuracy, outperforming existing baselines in both reliability and scalability.The code is available online.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Occupancy-Gated Parallel-CNN Bi-LSTM (OG-PCL) network for efficient human activity recognition using mmWave radar point clouds, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for privacy-preserving, efficient, and robust human activity recognition, avoiding cameras and wearable devices.

Method: Develop OG-PCL network with a tri-view parallel structure and Occupancy-Gated Convolution (OGConv) block, tailored to sparse 3D radar point cloud processing.

Result: OG-PCL achieves 91.75% accuracy on the RadHAR dataset, outperforming established methods like PointNet and 3D CNN.

Conclusion: OG-PCL is highly accurate and efficient, ideal for real-time radar-based HAR on lightweight platforms.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) with millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar offers a privacy-preserving and robust alternative to camera- and wearable-based approaches. In this work, we propose the Occupancy-Gated Parallel-CNN Bi-LSTM (OG-PCL) network to process sparse 3D radar point clouds produced by mmWave sensing. Designed for lightweight deployment, the parameter size of the proposed OG-PCL is only 0.83M and achieves 91.75 accuracy on the RadHAR dataset, outperforming those existing baselines such as 2D CNN, PointNet, and 3D CNN methods. We validate the advantages of the tri-view parallel structure in preserving spatial information across three dimensions while maintaining efficiency through ablation studies. We further introduce the Occupancy-Gated Convolution (OGConv) block and demonstrate the necessity of its occupancy compensation mechanism for handling sparse point clouds. The proposed OG-PCL thus offers a compact yet accurate framework for real-time radar-based HAR on lightweight platforms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RadHARSimulator V2, a simulator for radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) using video footage to generate Doppler spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar-based HAR lacks a flexible and comprehensive simulation method due to reliance on models and motion-captured data.

Method: The simulator integrates a computer vision module for human object detection and pose estimation and a radar module to generate Doppler spectra using methods like short-time Fourier transform and pulse compression.

Result: The simulator and a proposed hybrid parallel-serial neural network architecture for radar-based HAR were validated through numerical experiments, demonstrating their effectiveness.

Conclusion: RadHARSimulator V2 provides a flexible solution for generating realistic Doppler spectra from videos, enhancing radar-based HAR research. Open-source code is available for further exploration.

Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) still lacks a comprehensive simulation method. Existing software is developed based on models or motion-captured data, resulting in limited flexibility. To address this issue, a simulator that directly generates Doppler spectra from recorded video footage (RadHARSimulator V2) is presented in this paper. Both computer vision and radar modules are included in the simulator. In computer vision module, the real-time model for object detection with global nearest neighbor is first used to detect and track human targets in the video. Then, the high-resolution network is used to estimate two-dimensional poses of the detected human targets. Next, the three-dimensional poses of the detected human targets are obtained by nearest matching method. Finally, smooth temporal three-dimensional pose estimation is achieved through Kalman filtering. In radar module, pose interpolation and smoothing are first achieved through the Savitzky-Golay method. Second, the delay model and the mirror method are used to simulate echoes in both free-space and through-the-wall scenarios. Then, range-time map is generated using pulse compression, moving target indication, and DnCNN. Next, Doppler-time map (DTM) is generated using short-time Fourier transform and DnCNN again. Finally, the ridge features on the DTM are extracted using the maximum local energy method. In addition, a hybrid parallel-serial neural network architecture is proposed for radar-based HAR. Numerical experiments are conducted and analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed simulator and the proposed network model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of conventional geometry-based localization methods that depend on CSI estimation and lack robustness under varying beam geometries.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework combining a policy network and augmented weighted least squares estimator is introduced, learning directly from uplink responses and geometry features.

Result: Achieved significant performance improvement with 99.3% reduced mean positioning error compared to conventional methods, resulting in 0.395 m RMSE for near real-time inference.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust, efficient, and accurate localization method in dynamic beam scenarios, outperforming traditional approaches significantly.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based beam weighting framework that couples a policy network with an augmented weighted least squares (WLS) estimator for accurate and low-complexity positioning in multi-beam LEO constellations. Unlike conventional geometry or CSI-dependent approaches, the policy learns directly from uplink pilot responses and geometry features, enabling robust localization without explicit CSI estimation. An augmented WLS jointly estimates position and receiver clock bias, improving numerical stability under dynamic beam geometry. Across representative scenarios, the proposed method reduces the mean positioning error by 99.3% compared with the geometry-based baseline, achieving 0.395 m RMSE with near real-time inference.

*Itsuki Yazawa,Akira Furui*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method using variational autoencoder (VAE) for improved synthetic combined motion EMG signal generation, leading to better motion classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous methods that assumed linear combinations of basic motion EMG signals for generating combined motion patterns, which failed to account for complex neuromuscular phenomena.

Method: The paper utilizes a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a mix-consistency loss to structure the latent space of EMG signals. Synthetic motion patterns are generated within this latent space for training classifiers.

Result: The method improved motion classification accuracy by approximately 30%, validated through experiments involving upper-limb motion classification with eight participants.

Conclusion: The proposed structured latent space approach enhances the fidelity of synthetic EMG signals, offering a significant performance boost in recognizing combined motions using fewer real training samples.

Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG)-based motion classification using machine learning has been widely employed in applications such as prosthesis control. While previous studies have explored generating synthetic patterns of combined motions to reduce training data requirements, these methods assume that combined motions can be represented as linear combinations of basic motions. However, this assumption often fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena such as muscle co-contraction, resulting in low-fidelity synthetic signals and degraded classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions. We validated our approach through upper-limb motion classification experiments with eight healthy participants. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms input-space synthesis approaches, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy.

*Shadaab Ghani,Anne Håkansson,Oleksii Pasichnyi,Hossein Shahrokni*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPARA, a Conversational Agent (CA) system designed to aid housing cooperatives in Sweden in energy efficiency decisions. Preliminary results suggest a promising 80% precision in advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Housing cooperatives in Sweden face challenges managing energy efficiency decisions, pressured by EU directives on energy class ratings. Board members often lack expertise, necessitating innovative support tools.

Method: The researchers developed SPARA, an energy efficiency advisor using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and a Language Model (LM), relying on a knowledge base of professional advisor communications.

Result: SPARA demonstrated 80% precision in providing energy efficiency advice, matching municipal EE experts' performance in preliminary testing.

Conclusion: SPARA showcases the potential for LMs to assist housing cooperatives in meeting energy efficiency goals. Further evaluation is essential to address limitations like stability and trust in the system.

Abstract: Housing cooperative is a common type of multifamily building ownership in Sweden. Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for effective metrics to measure aspirations in socio-political instability for designing impactful educational technologies.

Method: Researchers adapted, translated, and tested Snyder's Hope Scale among 136 Afghan women learning programming online during systemic restrictions.

Result: The adapted scale showed strong reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.78), significant relevance, and a slight positive effect of LLM access on perceived educational pathways.

Conclusion: The adapted Hope Scale is effective in measuring aspirations in unstable contexts and can inform aspiration-driven educational technology design.

Abstract: Designing impactful educational technologies in contexts of socio-political instability requires a nuanced understanding of educational aspirations. Currently, scalable metrics for measuring aspirations are limited. This study adapts, translates, and evaluates Snyder's Hope Scale as a metric for measuring aspirations among 136 women learning programming online during a period of systemic educational restrictions in Afghanistan. The adapted scale demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.78) and participants rated it as understandable and relevant. While overall aspiration-related scores did not differ significantly by access to Large Language Models (LLMs), those with access reported marginally higher scores on the Avenues subscale (p = .056), suggesting broader perceived pathways to achieving educational aspirations. These findings support the use of the adapted scale as a metric for aspirations in contexts of socio-political instability. More broadly, the adapted scale can be used to evaluate the impact of aspiration-driven design of educational technologies.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how data owners convey consent for AI scraping and training in web-scale datasets, revealing ethical and legal concerns regarding insufficient respect for such expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raise awareness about data owners' expressions of consent in web-scale datasets used for training AI systems due to ethical and legal concerns.

Method: Study a large dataset (DataComp) through sample-level and domain-level analysis, evaluating copyright notices, watermarks, metadata, and website policies like Terms of Service and Robots Exclusion Protocol.

Result: Identify 122M samples likely under copyright, note ToS prohibitions in 60% of samples from top domains, and estimate 9-13% of samples may hold watermarks that are poorly detected.

Conclusion: Current AI data collection practices inadequately respect consent expressions from data owners, necessitating a standardized consent framework.

Abstract: The internet has become the main source of data to train modern text-to-image or vision-language models, yet it is increasingly unclear whether web-scale data collection practices for training AI systems adequately respect data owners' wishes. Ignoring the owner's indication of consent around data usage not only raises ethical concerns but also has recently been elevated into lawsuits around copyright infringement cases. In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping. Furthermore, we estimate 9-13\% with 95\% confidence interval of samples from CommonPool to contain watermarks, where existing watermark detection methods fail to capture them in high fidelity. Our holistic methods and findings show that data owners rely on various channels to convey data consent, of which current AI data collection pipelines do not entirely respect. These findings highlight the limitations of the current dataset curation/release practice and the need for a unified data consent framework taking AI purposes into consideration.

TL;DR: The article examines academic publishing's contradictory stance on AI use, highlighting incentives against transparency due to reputational risks, and proposing a new, transparent publishing model outside traditional prestige systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency and structural disincentives in current academic publishing regarding the disclosure of AI assistance.

Method: Analyzes limitations in existing prestige-driven publishing systems and proposes an alternate platform mandating AI disclosure, reproduction-focused review, and detailed documentation.

Result: The article itself serves as an example of its proposed approach, showcasing AI-assisted scholarship with transparent prompt logs and modifications.

Conclusion: Advocates for transparent, verification-centric academic publishing systems to better evaluate AI-assisted contributions and address broader methodological challenges.

Abstract: Academic publishing increasingly requires authors to disclose AI assistance, yet imposes reputational costs for doing so--especially when such assistance is substantial. This article analyzes that structural contradiction, showing how incentives discourage transparency in precisely the work where it matters most. Traditional venues cannot resolve this tension through policy tweaks alone, as the underlying prestige economy rewards opacity. To address this, the article proposes an alternative publishing infrastructure: a venue outside prestige systems that enforces mandatory disclosure, enables reproduction-based review, and supports ecological validity through detailed documentation. As a demonstration of this approach, the article itself is presented as an example of AI-assisted scholarship under reasonably detailed disclosure, with representative prompt logs and modification records included. Rather than taking a position for or against AI-assisted scholarship, the article outlines conditions under which such work can be evaluated on its own terms: through transparent documentation, verification-oriented review, and participation by methodologically committed scholars. While focused on AI, the framework speaks to broader questions about how academic systems handle methodological innovation.

TL;DR: This paper examines how Google's NotebookLM generates AI-based podcasts, focusing on its structural template and cultural translation biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI-generated podcasts like Google's NotebookLM function and their societal implications as a distinct form of media.

Method: The author uploaded varied text inputs into NotebookLM, analyzing the podcast structures and cultural translations from the output.

Result: The podcasts generated follow a fixed conversational template, translating texts into a standard Mid-Western American context, and exhibit cultural biases favoring white, middle-class American norms.

Conclusion: AI-generated podcasts mark a shift in media dynamics, moving from community-specific engagement in traditional podcasting to a standardized and culturally biased abstraction of the podcast format.

Abstract: This paper analyses AI-generated podcasts produced by Google's NotebookLM, which generates audio podcasts with two chatty AI hosts discussing whichever documents a user uploads. While AI-generated podcasts have been discussed as tools, for instance in medical education, they have not yet been analysed as media. By uploading different types of text and analysing the generated outputs I show how the podcasts' structure is built around a fixed template. I also find that NotebookLM not only translates texts from other languages into a perky standardised Mid-Western American accent, it also translates cultural contexts to a white, educated, middle-class American default. This is a distinct development in how publics are shaped by media, marking a departure from the multiple public spheres that scholars have described in human podcasting from the early 2000s until today, where hosts spoke to specific communities and responded to listener comments, to an abstraction of the podcast genre.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper presents CometNet, a method to improve long-term time series forecasting by addressing the limitations of existing Transformer and MLP models using contextual motif extraction and motif-guided forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the receptive field bottleneck in existing models, which fail to accurately forecast long-term time series due to the reliance on finite look-back windows and inefficiencies in handling long-term dependencies.

Method: CometNet introduces a contextual motif extraction module to identify crucial recurring patterns in data and employs a motif-guided forecasting module to integrate these patterns, enhancing long-term prediction accuracy.

Result: Experimental evaluation on eight real-world datasets demonstrates that CometNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for long forecasting horizons.

Conclusion: CometNet effectively addresses the challenges of long-term dependencies and computational inefficiencies in time series forecasting, making it a promising solution for improving prediction accuracy over extended horizons.

Abstract: Long-term Time Series Forecasting is crucial across numerous critical domains, yet its accuracy remains fundamentally constrained by the receptive field bottleneck in existing models. Mainstream Transformer- and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based methods mainly rely on finite look-back windows, limiting their ability to model long-term dependencies and hurting forecasting performance. Naively extending the look-back window proves ineffective, as it not only introduces prohibitive computational complexity, but also drowns vital long-term dependencies in historical noise. To address these challenges, we propose CometNet, a novel Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting framework. CometNet first introduces a Contextual Motif Extraction module that identifies recurrent, dominant contextual motifs from complex historical sequences, providing extensive temporal dependencies far exceeding limited look-back windows; Subsequently, a Motif-guided Forecasting module is proposed, which integrates the extracted dominant motifs into forecasting. By dynamically mapping the look-back window to its relevant motifs, CometNet effectively harnesses their contextual information to strengthen long-term forecasting capability. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that CometNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, particularly on extended forecast horizons.
