The IEEE-standardized\nframework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and\nconcepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks\nnative FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation\nenvironments.\n  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with\nSystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a\nsimulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature\nvalues from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified\ntarget software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data\nsuch as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,\nextensive software testing and verification is enabled.

Since these\nmodels are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also\nintroduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on\nwidely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess\naccuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by\nany of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major\nmanufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions,\nvoxel resolutions, and fields-of-view.

In contrast, ABDSynth\nyields slightly less accurate results, but its relaxed requirements in training\ndata make it an alternative when the annotation budget is limited.

Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via\nmapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.\nSpecifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the\nembedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood\n(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their\ncorresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these\nembedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable\nhuman effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for\nsemi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the\nexploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a\nmapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The\nannotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable\nLLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated\nanalysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of\nmapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations.
