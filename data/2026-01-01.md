### [1] [The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850)
*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDFT, a protocol for assessing models' epistemic robustness under semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. Results show robustness is independent of model size, emerging instead from training methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often fail to reliably maintain factual accuracy under realistic stresses like semantic degradation or adversarial probing. Current benchmarks cannot effectively identify these weaknesses.

Method: The authors propose DDFT, a protocol combining semantic compression and adversarial fabrication tests alongside a two-system cognitive model: a Semantic System for text generation and an Epistemic Verifier for factual validation.

Result: Epistemic robustness is not correlated with model size or architecture but with error detection capabilities. Smaller models can outperform larger ones in robustness, challenging common assumptions in the field.

Conclusion: DDFT presents a novel framework for gauging epistemic robustness, emphasizing error detection as key to reliability. Smaller models can be robust, overturning notions equating scale with reliability.

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

### [2] [CASCADE: Cumulative Agentic Skill Creation through Autonomous Development and Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23880)
*Xu Huang,Junwu Chen,Yuxing Fei,Zhuohan Li,Philippe Schwaller,Gerbrand Ceder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CASCADE is a self-evolving framework for LLMs, transitioning from traditional tool usage to skill acquisition while achieving high success rates in scientific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle with flexibility and effectiveness due to reliance on predefined tools or flawed tool generation, limiting their utility in complex scientific tasks.

Method: CASCADE employs two meta-skills: continuous learning using web searches and code extraction, and self-reflection through introspection and knowledge graph exploration, enabling agents to master external tools and codify knowledge.

Result: CASCADE achieved a 93.3% success rate on SciSkillBench compared to a 35.4% success rate without evolution mechanisms. It also demonstrated real-world success in various applications including computational analysis and autonomous experiments.

Conclusion: CASCADE exemplifies the progression from tool reliance to skill acquisition in LLM agents. By fostering adaptive and collaborative capabilities, it supports scalable AI-assisted scientific research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.

### [3] [A Proof-of-Concept for Explainable Disease Diagnosis Using Large Language Models and Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23932)
*Ioanna Gemou,Evangelos Lamprou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and Answer Set Programming (ASP) for accurate disease prediction from medical literature and patient data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of limited adoption of symbolic AI in healthcare due to the effort needed in constructing high-quality knowledge bases.

Method: The authors design McCoy—a system that uses LLMs to translate medical literature into ASP code, integrates it with patient data, and employs an ASP solver for disease diagnosis.

Result: Preliminary results indicate McCoy achieves strong performance in small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

Conclusion: McCoy demonstrates the potential to enhance interpretability and performance in disease prediction by leveraging both LLMs and ASP.

Abstract: Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

### [4] [SPARK: Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24008)
*Gaurab Chhetri,Subasish Das,Tausif Islam Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPARK proposes a multi-agent framework leveraging LLMs for dynamic, personalized search, using personas-based coordination and emergent behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search systems struggle to account for dynamic and complex user information needs, constrained by static profiles and inflexible retrieval pipelines.

Method: SPARK employs persona-based LLM agents with specialized roles, memory systems, and inter-agent communication protocols for task-specific retrieval and personalization.

Result: SPARK showcases emergent personalization through coordinated agents, improving retrieval efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load performance.

Conclusion: The framework advances next-gen personalized search by demonstrating cooperative multi-agent behavior and adaptive learning for evolving user needs.

Abstract: Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

### [5] [ROAD: Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging for Zero-Shot Agent Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24040)
*Natchaya Temyingyong,Daman Jain,Neeraj Kumarsahu,Prabhat Kumar,Rachata Phondi,Wachiravit Modecrua,Krittanon Kaewtawee,Krittin Pachtrachai,Touchapon Kraisingkorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ROAD introduces a novel framework for automatic prompt optimization that doesn't rely on refined datasets, instead using failure analysis and debugging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in software engineering where curated datasets are unavailable during the cold start of agent development.

Method: A multi-agent architecture is used consisting of Analyzer, Optimizer, and Coach to convert failure logs into Decision Tree Protocols.

Result: ROAD achieves significant improvement in success rate and search accuracy, demonstrating data-efficiency and reliability across benchmarks and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: ROAD offers an effective, data-efficient alternative to RL training, mimicking human debugging approaches for optimizing LLM performance.

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on large, labeled gold-standard development sets to compute fitness scores for evolutionary or Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline. These findings suggest that mimicking the human engineering loop of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.

### [6] [LoongFlow: Directed Evolutionary Search via a Cognitive Plan-Execute-Summarize Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24077)
*Chunhui Wan,Xunan Dai,Zhuo Wang,Minglei Li,Yanpeng Wang,Yinan Mao,Yu Lan,Zhiwen Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LoongFlow is a framework for creating self-evolving agents that surpasses traditional methods by integrating a structured cognitive reasoning process, achieving reduced computational costs and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-improving agents and the limitations of traditional evolutionary methods in achieving this transformation, such as lack of structured reasoning, premature convergence, and inefficient exploration.

Method: LoongFlow introduces a "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm, using LLMs for structured evolutionary search. It employs a hybrid evolutionary memory system combining Multi-Island models, MAP-Elites, and adaptive Boltzmann selection to achieve exploration-exploitation balance and prevent stagnation.

Result: LoongFlow outperformed leading baselines by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency and consistently delivered superior solutions across benchmarks such as AlphaEvolve and Kaggle competitions.

Conclusion: The framework provides a significant advancement in autonomous scientific discovery by generating expert-level solutions efficiently and marking progress in the development of self-improving agents.

Abstract: The transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-improving agents is hindered by the lack of structured reasoning in traditional evolutionary approaches. Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces. To address these challenges, we introduce LoongFlow, a self-evolving agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art solution quality with significantly reduced computational costs. Unlike "blind" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions. LoongFlow marks a substantial step forward in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling the generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead.

### [7] [CogRec: A Cognitive Recommender Agent Fusing Large Language Models and Soar for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24113)
*Jiaxin Hu,Tao Wang,Bingsan Yang,Hongrun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CogRec, a cognitive recommender agent combining LLMs and the Soar cognitive architecture to address challenges in black-box characteristics, knowledge hallucination, and learning adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations of LLMs (trustworthiness, adaptability issues) and Soar architectures (slow knowledge acquisition) in recommendation systems.

Method: CogRec integrates LLMs for dynamic knowledge initialization and Soar for symbolic reasoning. It utilizes the PCA cycle and converts reasoned solutions into production rules for robust online learning.

Result: Evaluations on three datasets reveal CogRec's enhanced recommendation accuracy, explainability, and ability to tackle the long-tail problem.

Conclusion: CogRec successfully synergizes LLMs and Soar, producing a robust and interpretable recommendation agent with dynamic learning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity in understanding user preferences for recommendation systems. However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent "Black-Box" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.

### [8] [Graph-Based Exploration for ARC-AGI-3 Interactive Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24156)
*Evgenii Rudakov,Jonathan Shock,Benjamin Ultan Cowley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph-based approach addressing interactive reasoning challenges in ARC-AGI-3 greatly outperforms LLMs, achieving 3rd place on the leaderboard by systematically exploring state-action spaces without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in solving complex interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark and to showcase the benefits of systematic exploration methods.

Method: The method integrates vision-based frame segmentation, graph-structured state-space tracking, and a salience-driven action prioritization strategy to explore and solve tasks without requiring training.

Result: The proposed approach ranked 3rd in the ARC-AGI-3 private leaderboard, solving 30 out of 52 levels, and significantly outperformed frontier LLM-based agents.

Conclusion: Explicit graph-structured exploration provides a compelling baseline for interactive reasoning, highlighting the utility of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where LLMs underperform.

Abstract: We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics. The code is open source and available at https://github.com/dolphin-in-a-coma/arc-agi-3-just-explore.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Science Context Protocol (SCP) provides an open-source standard for seamless collaboration between AI agents and researchers by unifying scientific resources and orchestrating experimental workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate scientific discovery by creating a standardized protocol for integrating diverse resources and enabling collaboration between autonomous scientific agents.

Method: The paper introduces SCP, built on Unified Resource Integration and Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management, supported by a secure architecture consisting of an SCP Hub and Servers.

Result: SCP supports a discovery platform with over 1,600 resources, facilitating interoperability, large-scale collaboration, and reproducibility in scientific research.

Conclusion: SCP's standardization and orchestration significantly enhance scalability, collaboration, and efficiency in multi-institution, agent-driven scientific endeavors.

Abstract: We introduce SCP: the Science Context Protocol, an open-source standard designed to accelerate discovery by enabling a global network of autonomous scientific agents. SCP is built on two foundational pillars: (1) Unified Resource Integration: At its core, SCP provides a universal specification for describing and invoking scientific resources, spanning software tools, models, datasets, and physical instruments. This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility. By standardizing scientific context and tool orchestration at the protocol level, SCP establishes essential infrastructure for scalable, multi-institution, agent-driven science.

### [10] [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Solving the Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24251)
*Pengfu Wan,Jiawei Chen,Gangyan Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to solve the Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) efficiently, achieving near-optimal results rapidly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The FSMVRP involves simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing in real-world contexts such as vehicle rentals and logistics but poses challenges in large-scale, time-sensitive scenarios.

Method: The method formulates FSMVRP as a Markov Decision Process using a new policy network called FRIPN, which integrates routing and fleet decisions alongside specialized input embeddings.

Result: Experiments on generated and benchmark datasets show that the proposed method is computationally efficient, scalable, and advantageous in solving FSMVRP for large and time-constrained cases.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates promise for practical applications and sets a foundation for applying DRL techniques to other complex VRP variants.

Abstract: The Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) is a prominent variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), extensively studied in operations research and computational science. FSMVRP requires simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios such as short-term vehicle rental and on-demand logistics. However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a novel policy network, termed FRIPN, that seamlessly integrates fleet composition and routing decisions. Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained scenarios. These strengths highlight the potential of our approach for practical applications and provide valuable inspiration for extending DRL-based techniques to other variants of VRP.

### [11] [Constrained Language Model Policy Optimization via Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24263)
*Lijun Zhang,Lin Li,Wei Wei,Yajie Qi,Huizhong Song,Jun Wang,Yaodong Yang,Jiye Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The authors introduce Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a method aiming to incorporate risk awareness into fine-tuning pre-trained language models, providing better safety and robustness against harmful behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods lack sufficient risk awareness and robustness, particularly against rare but severe harmful behaviors.

Method: The RSA method incorporates nested risk measures into token-level constrained policy optimization for language models, utilizing a stepwise alignment procedure for safer fine-tuning.

Result: RSA mitigates model risks from excessive shifts while suppressing low-probability, high-impact harmful behavior. Experimental results demonstrate enhanced safety and helpfulness.

Conclusion: RSA provides a novel approach to risk-aware language model alignment, improving safety and reducing catastrophic hazards while maintaining performance.

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a test-time adaptive agent for more effective exploratory inference in partially observable environments, without needing additional training or gradient-based updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM agents operating in partially observable environments by enhancing their inference and decision-making processes without additional computational overhead.

Method: The proposed agent maintains a structured belief about the environment, updates iteratively via action-conditioned observations, and selects actions to maximize predicted information gain. A lightweight surrogate LLM estimates the information gain, and a novel reward measures alignment between the posterior belief and real-world configurations.

Result: The method achieves better alignment with latent world states compared to scaling-based LLM inference techniques, while requiring significantly less integration overhead.

Conclusion: The test-time adaptive agent effectively improves inference and world alignment in partial observability scenarios, advancing the performance of LLM agents with minimal computational resource demands.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a test-time adaptive agent that performs exploratory inference through posterior-guided belief refinement without relying on gradient-based updates or additional training for LLM agent operating under partial observability. Our agent maintains an external structured belief over the environment state, iteratively updates it via action-conditioned observations, and selects actions by maximizing predicted information gain over the belief space. We estimate information gain using a lightweight LLM-based surrogate and assess world alignment through a novel reward that quantifies the consistency between posterior belief and ground-truth environment configuration. Experiments show that our method outperforms inference-time scaling baselines such as prompt-augmented or retrieval-enhanced LLMs, in aligning with latent world states with significantly lower integration overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle AI challenges in solving diverse physical tasks and generalizing to unseen environments by leveraging learned representation spaces for efficient planning.

Method: Using JEPA-WMs framework, researchers examine model architecture, training objectives, and planning algorithms through experiments in simulated and real-world robotic environments.

Result: The proposed model shows better performance than DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC baselines in navigation and manipulation tasks, backed by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: JEPA-WMs present a superior approach for task generalization and efficiency in robotics, suggesting their potential for broader AI applications. Their contributions include open-source resources facilitating further research.

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success.

### [14] [Thinking on Maps: How Foundation Model Agents Explore, Remember, and Reason Map Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24504)
*Zhiwei Wei,Yuxing Liu,Hua Liao,Wenjia Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates foundation model agents' spatial understanding in symbolic map environments via an interactive framework, focusing on exploration, memory representation, and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze foundation models' abilities and limitations in spatial reasoning and map-based applications.

Method: Introduced an interactive evaluation framework where agents explore grid-based maps and solve spatial tasks like path planning, using varied exploration, memory, and reasoning strategies.

Result: Exploration impacts experience acquisition, structured memory improves task performance, and reasoning schemes enhance inference. Performance saturates beyond a certain capability threshold.

Conclusion: Improvements in spatial reasoning need tailored techniques for spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling the model's size.

Abstract: Map environments provide a fundamental medium for representing spatial structure. Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.

### [15] [Evaluating the Reasoning Abilities of LLMs on Underrepresented Mathematics Competition Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24505)
*Samuel Golladay,Majid Bani-Yaghoub*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates three leading LLMs on underrepresented math competition problems, finding DeepSeek-V3 to perform best overall, but Geometry remains a weak domain for all.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the performance and limitations of LLMs on underrepresented and diverse mathematics competition problems, addressing the shortcomings of previous benchmarks.

Method: The study prompted three LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, DeepSeek-V3) with mathematics competition problems in Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, and analyzed their accuracy and reasoning against correct solutions.

Result: DeepSeek-V3 outperformed the other two in all subjects, while all models performed poorly in Geometry. Errors were characterized across models: computational/logical for DeepSeek-V3, logical/approach-based for GPT-4o-mini, and incomplete/rushed reasoning for Gemini.

Conclusion: Underrepresented datasets reveal distinct weaknesses in structured reasoning across LLMs. Significant challenges in Geometry and reasoning highlight areas for improvement in model development.

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of Large Language Models, or LLMs, in mathematical reasoning has been the focus of several recent studies. However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses LLMs' challenges in spatial reasoning and multi-step planning by proposing a two-stage learning framework involving supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using an ASCII-based environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this research is to enhance the spatial reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), which struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning, despite their strength in general language capabilities.

Method: The proposed method consists of two stages: supervised fine-tuning for elementary spatial transformations (e.g., rotation, translation, scaling) followed by training lightweight LoRA adapters in a reinforcement learning framework to compose these transformations into multi-step plans. The method also utilizes an ASCII-art dataset and a custom reinforcement learning environment.

Result: The method outperformed baseline models including generic, physics-aware, and end-to-end RL models in both dynamic and static environments. It also achieved faster convergence and more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch.

Conclusion: The study concludes that their approach improves LLMs' spatial reasoning and planning capabilities, as well as training efficiency. It also highlights the potential benefits of supervised fine-tuning for enhancing spatial understanding.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly serving as autonomous agents, and their utilization of external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is considered a future trend. Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness. To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency. Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recursive Language Models (RLMs) for improving processing of lengthy prompts by large language models (LLMs), enabling handling inputs longer than their context windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of LLMs in processing prompts that exceed their fixed context windows and enhance their capability for handling diverse long-context tasks effectively and efficiently.

Method: Recursive Language Models (RLMs) use an inference strategy where the model examines, decomposes, and recursively calls itself to process snippets of a long prompt.

Result: RLMs handle inputs up to 100 times longer than typical context windows. They outperform base LLMs and other long-context strategies on multiple tasks while maintaining or reducing processing costs.

Conclusion: RLMs significantly improve LLM performance on long-context tasks, offering a scalable and cost-efficient solution for inference-time processing of arbitrarily long inputs.

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.

Abstract: This paper proposes a group deliberation oriented multi-agent conversational model to address the limitations of single large language models in complex reasoning tasks. The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the manual labor in building high-quality agents, tackle static capabilities issues in deployed agents, enable continuous evolution, and improve adaptability in dynamic environments.

Method: Youtu-Agent establishes a structured configuration system, introduces automated generation paradigms (Workflow and Meta-Agent modes), and integrates a hybrid policy optimization system with modules for agent practice and reinforcement learning.

Result: Youtu-Agent achieved state-of-the-art scores on WebWalkerQA and GAIA benchmarks, high tool synthesis success rates, performance improvements on reasoning and searching tasks, and significant training speedup.

Conclusion: Youtu-Agent effectively automates agent generation, improves adaptability with scalable reinforcement learning, and enhances LLM agents’ coding and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\%) and GAIA (72.8\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\% and +5.4\% respectively. Moreover, our Agent RL training achieves 40\% speedup with steady performance improvement on 7B LLMs, enhancing coding/reasoning and searching capabilities respectively up to 35\% and 21\% on Maths and general/multi-hop QA benchmarks.

*Pengcheng Xia,Yixiang Huang,Chengjin Qin,Chengliang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain fault diagnosis model utilizing dual disentanglement to enhance generalization and robustness across unseen conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for intelligent fault diagnosis struggle with generalizing to unseen conditions and rely heavily on single-modal sensing signals. These methods lack domain generalization and neglect the advantages of multi-modal data.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement. It decouples features into modality/domain-invariant and modality/domain-specific representations, employs a cross-domain mixed fusion strategy to augment diversity, and utilizes a triple-modal fusion mechanism for effective integration of multi-modal information.

Result: Experiments on induction motor fault diagnosis demonstrate superior performance of the proposed model under unseen constant and time-varying conditions, outperforming existing methods. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component to the model’s effectiveness.

Conclusion: This method provides a robust framework for fault diagnosis under diverse conditions by leveraging multi-modal information and enhancing domain generalization. It outperforms competing models and exhibits strong potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

*Songqi Zhou,Ruixue Liu,Boman Su,Jiazhou Wang,Yixing Wang,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BatteryAgent, a framework combining physical features and large language models for advanced lithium-ion battery fault diagnosis, going beyond traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods, despite high accuracy in fault detection for lithium-ion batteries, lack interpretability and fail to offer root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations.

Method: BatteryAgent integrates three modules: a Physical Perception Layer for mechanism-based features, a Detection and Attribution Layer with Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP, and a Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer using LLMs to provide diagnostics and recommendations.

Result: The approach achieved an impressive Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.986 and bettered current state-of-the-art methods, enhancing diagnostic clarity and shifting towards multi-type interpretable diagnosis.

Conclusion: BatteryAgent establishes a move from conventional fault detection to an interpretable hierarchical framework for fault diagnosis and recommendations in battery safety management.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited interpretability of latent models for household object rearrangement by identifying human-inspired constructs guiding object arrangement.

Method: A self-report questionnaire was developed and validated using a 63-participant study, followed by integration of constructs into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner.

Result: The validated constructs demonstrated psychological distinction and explanatory power, and the integrated robot planner generated arrangements closely resembling participant-generated options.

Conclusion: The study provides a compact, interpretable framework for object arrangement preferences and validates its utility in robotic systems.

Abstract: Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.

*Marko Jojic,Nebojsa Jojic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenZ, a hybrid approach combining foundational models and statistical modeling using interpretable semantic features for domain-specific prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenZ seeks to overcome foundational models' limitation in capturing dataset-specific patterns essential for prediction tasks, by enriching it with statistical modeling and discovered semantic features.

Method: A generalized EM algorithm is used to jointly optimize semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. Semantic features are discovered iteratively by contrasting groups based on statistical modeling errors, prompted via a frozen foundational model.

Result: GenZ substantially improves prediction accuracy, achieving a 12% median relative error in house price prediction (from multimodal data). It shows equivalency to traditional collaborative filtering in predicting Netflix movie embeddings without requiring user ratings.

Conclusion: The hybrid model demonstrates potential in capturing dataset-specific patterns better than standalone foundational models and reveals interpretable semantic features critical for predictions in specific domains.

Abstract: We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for creating shift schedules in long-term care facilities by extracting constraints using templates and excluding exceptional constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term care facilities require facility-specific shift scheduling due to unique operational conditions, emphasizing the need for a tailored approach.

Method: The method employs constraint templates capable of extracting a variety of shift patterns and combinations. It incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints, enhancing scheduling outcomes.

Result: The proposed method generated schedules that met all hard constraints and minimized violations for soft constraints.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addressed scheduling challenges in long-term care facilities, offering adaptable and precise constraint extraction methods.

Abstract: Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a comprehensive, end-to-end ecosystem for developing agentic LLMs capable of iterative and adaptive interactions.

Method: The authors propose ALE composed of three components: ROLL for post-training weight optimization, ROCK for sandbox trajectory management, and iFlow CLI for efficient context engineering. Additionally, they present ROME, an agent model trained on one million trajectories and utilize a novel policy optimization algorithm called IPA.

Result: ROME, utilizing ALE, demonstrates superior performance across benchmarks including SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench Pro while offering stable long-horizon training.

Conclusion: The ALE infrastructure provides significant advancements in crafting agentic LLMs, validated by ROME's performance across multiple evaluation benchmarks, highlighting the utility of the ecosystem.

Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.

Abstract: This report presents the design and implementation of a semi-automated data annotation pipeline developed within the DARTS project, whose goal is to create a large-scale, multimodal dataset of driving scenarios recorded in Polish conditions. Manual annotation of such heterogeneous data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, the proposed solution adopts a human-in-the-loop approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to reduce annotation cost and duration. The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous vehicle research in Poland.

*Augusto B. Corrêa,Yoav Gelberg,Luckeciano C. Melo,Ilia Shumailov,André G. Pereira,Yarin Gal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Iterative deployment and user-curated data improve planning skills in LLMs, with implications for AI training and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how iterative deployment and fine-tuning with curated data shape large language models' capabilities.

Method: Deploy LLMs iteratively, fine-tune them on user-curated data, and analyze theoretical links to reinforcement learning.

Result: Later models show improved planning skills, better generalization, and discover longer plans compared to initial models.

Conclusion: Iterative deployment functions similarly to reinforcement learning, raising safety concerns and offering an alternative training approach through data curation.

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STAgent is a large language model tailored for spatio-temporal reasoning, achieving high performance in tasks like point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a language model specialized in solving complex spatio-temporal reasoning tasks while retaining general-purpose functionality.

Method: STAgent uses a stable tool environment, hierarchical data curation framework, and a cascaded training recipe for fine-tuning, leveraging domain-specific tools and filtering high-quality data.

Result: STAgent exhibits strong performance on TravelBench while maintaining general-purpose capabilities.

Conclusion: STAgent demonstrates the effectiveness of a specialized model for spatio-temporal tasks through innovative methods and maintains versatility across benchmarks.

Abstract: We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.

Abstract: This study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%. This benchmarking study moves toward formalizing the assessment of LLM-based BEMS AI agents and identifying future research directions, emphasizing the trade-off between response accuracy and computational efficiency.

### [32] [HERO-Sign: Hierarchical Tuning and Efficient Compiler-Time GPU Optimizations for SPHINCS+ Signature Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23969)
*Yaoyun Zhou,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper presents HERO Sign, a GPU-accelerated SPHINCS+ implementation that uses hierarchical tuning and compiler optimizations to significantly improve signature generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPHINCS+ is secure against post-quantum attacks but suffers from slow signature generation due to heavy hash computations. The motivation is to address this inefficiency by leveraging the parallel capabilities of GPUs more effectively.

Method: HERO Sign uses a Tree Fusion strategy guided by an automated Tree Tuning algorithm, adaptive compilation strategy with PTX/native paths, and a task graph-based overlapping strategy for batched signature generation.

Result: HERO Sign achieves 1.24-3.13 times better throughput compared to previous GPU implementations across various SPHINCS+ parameter sets, with reductions in kernel launch latency by an order of magnitude on GPUs like RTX 4090, A100, H100, and GTX 2080.

Conclusion: HERO Sign optimizes SPHINCS+ signature generation by fully exploiting GPU parallelism and fine-grained compiler customization, delivering substantial performance improvements and versatility across GPU architectures.

Abstract: SPHINCS+ is a stateless hash-based signature scheme that provides strong post quantum security, but its signature generation is slow due to intensive hash computations. GPUs offer massive parallelism that can potentially accelerate SPHINCS+ signatures. However, existing GPU-based optimizations either fail to fully exploit the inherent parallelism of SPHINCS+'s Merkle tree structure or lack fine-grained, compiler-level customization across its diverse computational kernels. This paper proposes HERO Sign, a GPU-accelerated SPHINCS+ implementation that adopts hierarchical tuning and efficient compiler time optimizations. HERO Sign reexamines the parallelization opportunities enabled by data independence across SPHINCS+ components, including FORS, MSS, and WOTS+. It introduces a Tree Fusion strategy for FORS, which contains a large number of independent branches. The fusion strategy is guided by an automated Tree Tuning search algorithm that adapts fusion schemes to different GPU architectures. To further improve performance, HERO Sign employs an adaptive compilation strategy that accounts for the varying effectiveness of compiler optimizations across SPHINCS+ kernels such as FORS Sign, TREE Sign, and WOTS+ Sign. During compilation, the strategy automatically selects between PTX and native code paths to maximize efficiency. For batched signature generation, HERO Sign optimizes kernel-level overlapping using a task graph-based construction to reduce multi-stream idle time and kernel launch overhead. Experimental results show that, compared to state of the art GPU implementations, HERO Sign achieves throughput improvements of 1.28-3.13, 1.28-2.92, and 1.24-2.60 under the SPHINCS+ 128f, 192f, and 256f parameter sets on RTX 4090. Similar gains are observed on A100, H100, and GTX 2080, along with a two orders of magnitude reduction in kernel launch latency.

### [33] [Enriching Historical Records: An OCR and AI-Driven Approach for Database Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23710)
*Zahra Abedi,Richard M. K. van Dijk,Gijs Wijnholds,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study focuses on digitizing and analyzing historical books about Leiden University professors using an automated pipeline combining OCR, generative AI, and database linking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an automated system that processes and harmonizes data from historical records with modern databases, addressing challenges in digitization and data interpretation.

Method: The authors used OCR for digitizing text, generative AI for structured data extraction, and linkage algorithms for associating extracted data with existing database records.

Result: The OCR process had a CER of 1.08% and WER of 5.06%. JSON extraction from OCR reached 63% accuracy, improving to 65% with annotated text. The linking algorithm achieved 94% accuracy with annotated data and 81% with OCR-derived data.

Conclusion: The study offers a significant contribution to digital humanities by deploying a robust automated pipeline that enhances the digitization and analysis of historical documents while addressing layout and terminology issues.

Abstract: This research digitizes and analyzes the Leidse hoogleraren en lectoren 1575-1815 books written between 1983 and 1985, which contain biographic data about professors and curators of Leiden University. It addresses the central question: how can we design an automated pipeline that integrates OCR, LLM-based interpretation, and database linking to harmonize data from historical document images with existing high-quality database records? We applied OCR techniques, generative AI decoding constraints that structure data extraction, and database linkage methods to process typewritten historical records into a digital format. OCR achieved a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.08 percent and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.06 percent, while JSON extraction from OCR text achieved an average accuracy of 63 percent and, based on annotated OCR, 65 percent. This indicates that generative AI somewhat corrects low OCR performance. Our record linkage algorithm linked annotated JSON files with 94% accuracy and OCR-derived JSON files with 81%. This study contributes to digital humanities research by offering an automated pipeline for interpreting digitized historical documents, addressing challenges like layout variability and terminology differences, and exploring the applicability and strength of an advanced generative AI model.

### [34] [CAT: A Metric-Driven Framework for Analyzing the Consistency-Accuracy Relation of LLMs under Controlled Input Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23711)
*Paulo Cavalin,Cassia Sanctos,Marcelo Grave,Claudio Pinhanez,Yago Primerano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAT, a framework to evaluate the balance between response accuracy and consistency in large language models (LLMs) using multiple-choice benchmarks, along with new metrics and visual tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of LLMs primarily emphasizes accuracy and benchmark scores, failing to sufficiently address consistency, a crucial property for robust real-world applications.

Method: The CAT framework introduces Consistency-Accuracy Relation (CAR) curves and the CORE index to assess the interplay between accuracy and consistency. It also demonstrates adaptability to various tasks.

Result: CAR curves and the CORE index are demonstrated with diverse LLMs across multiple benchmarks, showing nuanced insights into their accuracy-consistency trade-offs.

Conclusion: CAT enables a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs, balancing accuracy with consistency, and can extend to other tasks like long-form or open-ended evaluations.

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{CAT}, a framework designed to evaluate and visualize the \emph{interplay} of \emph{accuracy} and \emph{response consistency} of Large Language Models (LLMs) under controllable input variations, using multiple-choice (MC) benchmarks as a case study. Current evaluation practices primarily focus on model capabilities such as accuracy or benchmark scores and, more recently, measuring consistency is being considered an essential property for deploying LLMs in high-stake, real-world applications. We argue in this paper that although both dimensions should still be evaluated independently, their inter-dependency also need to be considered for a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs. At the core of \textsc{CAT} are the \emph{Consistency-Accuracy Relation (CAR)} curves, which visualize how model accuracy varies with increasing consistency requirements, as defined by the \emph{Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (MCA)} metric. We further propose the \emph{Consistency-Oriented Robustness Estimate (CORE)} index, a global metric that combines the area and shape of the CAR curve to quantify the trade-off between accuracy and consistency. We present a practical demonstration of our framework across a diverse set of generalist and domain-specific LLMs, evaluated on multiple MC benchmarks. We also outline how \textsc{CAT} can be extended beyond MC tasks to support long-form, open-ended evaluations through adaptable scoring functions.

*Guanghui Wang,Jinze Yu,Xing Zhang,Dayuan Jiang,Yin Song,Tomal Deb,Xuefeng Liu,Peiyang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining a new metric (STED) and a consistency scoring mechanism to evaluate and improve structured data consistency in LLM outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address critical issues of output consistency in LLM-generated structured data, which is essential for reliable production use.

Method: The paper combines STED (a new semantic-structural similarity metric) and a consistency scoring framework that evaluates reliability by aggregating STED results across repeated outputs.

Result: STED achieves superior performance in distinguishing semantic and structural consistency compared to other metrics. It was used to benchmark six LLMs, highlighting consistency differences.

Conclusion: The framework provides theoretical and practical tools for improving structured data generation reliability in LLMs, enabling tasks like model selection, prompt refinement, and inconsistency diagnostics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for structured data generation, yet output consistency remains critical for production applications. We introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving consistency in LLM-generated structured outputs. Our approach combines: (1) STED (Semantic Tree Edit Distance), a novel similarity metric balancing semantic flexibility with structural strictness when comparing JSON outputs, and (2) a consistency scoring framework aggregating multiple STED measurements across repeated generations to quantify reliability. Through systematic experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled schema, expression, and semantic variations, we demonstrate STED achieves superior performance ($0.86-0.90$ similarity for semantic equivalents, $0.0$ for structural breaks) compared to existing metrics including TED, BERTScore, and DeepDiff. Applying our framework to benchmark six LLMs reveals significant variations: Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrates exceptional consistency, maintaining near-perfect structural reliability even at high temperatures ($T=0.9$), while models like Claude-3-Haiku and Nova-Pro exhibit substantial degradation requiring careful tuning. Our framework enables practical applications including targeted model selection for structured tasks, iterative prompt refinement for reproducible results, and diagnostic analysis to identify inconsistency root causes. This work provides theoretical foundations and practical tools for ensuring reliable structured output generation in LLM-based production systems.

TL;DR: The paper presents BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based framework for Bangla-to-Python code generation, achieving new benchmarks using iterative self-correction and multi-agent prompting with multilingual LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the gap in code generation from low-resource languages such as Bangla, which has not seen the same advancements as English-to-code generation.

Method: The paper introduces BanglaCodeAct, leveraging multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. It uses a Thought-Code-Observation loop in open-source multilingual LLMs for generating, testing, and refining code based on Bangla instructions without task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: BanglaCodeAct achieves a pass@1 accuracy of 94.0% on the development set and 71.6% on the blind test set for Bangla-to-Python code translation, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the viability of agent-based frameworks for reliable code translation in low-resource languages, emphasizing their potential in multilingual settings. The framework and scripts are also made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: LLMs excel at code generation from English prompts, but this progress has not extended to low-resource languages. We address Bangla-to-Python code generation by introducing BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based framework that leverages multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. Unlike prior approaches relying on task-specific fine-tuning, BanglaCodeAct employs an open-source multilingual LLM within a Thought-Code-Observation loop, enabling dynamic generation, testing, and refinement of code from Bangla instructions. We benchmark several small-parameter open-source LLMs and evaluate their effectiveness on the mHumanEval dataset for Bangla NL2Code. Our results show that Qwen3-8B, when deployed with BanglaCodeAct, achieves the best performance, with pass@1 accuracy of 94.0\% on the development set and 71.6\% on the blind test set. These results establish a new benchmark for Bangla-to-Python translation and highlight the potential of agent-based reasoning for reliable code generation in low-resource languages.

*Tingwei Xie,Tianyi Zhou,Yonghong Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PharmaShip is a new Chinese dataset for testing text-layout models using pharmaceutical shipping documents with noisy OCR and varied templates. It includes tasks like entity recognition, relation extraction, and reading order prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and enhance the performance of text-layout models under real-world noisy conditions and improve safety-critical document understanding in the pharmaceutical domain.

Method: A dataset and benchmark were developed, and five baseline models (LiLT, LayoutLMv3, GeoLayoutLM, and RORE-enhanced variants) were tested under standardized preprocessing, splits, and optimization.

Result: Results showed the benefits of combining pixel and geometry features, with reading-order regularization boosting performance. Challenges exist in segment-level reading order prediction due to boundary ambiguity.

Conclusion: PharmaShip provides a reproducible benchmark, underscoring the value of sequence-aware constraints in modeling document structures. Its release fosters advancements in document understanding for the pharmaceutical field.

Abstract: We present PharmaShip, a real-world Chinese dataset of scanned pharmaceutical shipping documents designed to stress-test pre-trained text-layout models under noisy OCR and heterogeneous templates. PharmaShip covers three complementary tasks-sequence entity recognition (SER), relation extraction (RE), and reading order prediction (ROP)-and adopts an entity-centric evaluation protocol to minimize confounds across architectures. We benchmark five representative baselines spanning pixel-aware and geometry-aware families (LiLT, LayoutLMv3-base, GeoLayoutLM and their available RORE-enhanced variants), and standardize preprocessing, splits, and optimization. Experiments show that pixels and explicit geometry provide complementary inductive biases, yet neither alone is sufficient: injecting reading-order-oriented regularization consistently improves SER and EL and yields the most robust configuration, while longer positional coverage stabilizes late-page predictions and reduces truncation artifacts. ROP is accurate at the word level but challenging at the segment level, reflecting boundary ambiguity and long-range crossings. PharmaShip thus establishes a controlled, reproducible benchmark for safety-critical document understanding in the pharmaceutical domain and highlights sequence-aware constraints as a transferable bias for structure modeling. We release the dataset at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/PharmaShip.

TL;DR: The paper presents the Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP) to study persona emergence in large language models via noise injection, leading to observable stable persona modes and significant behavioral transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and experimentally study how noise influences persona formation and behavioral transitions in large language models through reproducible methods.

Method: The authors use stochastic noise seeds in initial generation states across 152 cycles, analyzing linguistic changes and behaviors. They evaluated stability and differences in persona modes quantitatively.

Result: Three stable persona modes with distinct entropy were identified. Noise injections reliably caused phase transitions in linguistic patterns. Retained persona consistency and significant behavioral variations (p < 0.01) were confirmed.

Conclusion: The LN-RP framework offers a reproducible approach to investigate emergent behaviors, reflexive generative dynamics, and linguistic coherence in large language models.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP), a computational framework for analyzing noise-driven persona emergence in large language models. By injecting stochastic noise seeds into the initial generation state, we observe nonlinear transitions in linguistic behavior across 152 generation cycles. Our results reveal three stable persona modes with distinct entropy signatures, and demonstrate that external noise sources can reliably induce phase transitions in reflexive generation dynamics. Quantitative evaluation confirms consistent persona retention and significant differences across modes (p < 0.01). The protocol provides a reproducible method for studying reflexive generation, emergent behavior, and longrange linguistic coherence in LLMs.

### [39] [HarmTransform: Transforming Explicit Harmful Queries into Stealthy via Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23717)
*Shenzhe Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework designed to generate covert harmful queries through iterative critique and refinement, improving LLM safety training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment strategies for LLMs focus on overtly harmful content and neglect disguised harmful queries, which creates vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose HarmTransform, wherein multiple agents engage in iterative critiques to transform harmful queries into covert forms without changing their harmful intent.

Result: HarmTransform outperforms existing baselines in generating covert harmful query transformations, though debates can also introduce topic shifts or unnecessary complexity.

Conclusion: Multi-agent debate frameworks like HarmTransform offer both opportunities and challenges for enhancing safety training data, potentially advancing LLM safety alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with safety mechanisms to detect and block harmful queries, yet current alignment approaches primarily focus on overtly dangerous content and overlook more subtle threats. However, users can often disguise harmful intent through covert rephrasing that preserves malicious objectives while appearing benign, which creates a significant gap in existing safety training data. To address this limitation, we introduce HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework for systematically transforming harmful queries into stealthier forms while preserving their underlying harmful intent. Our framework leverages iterative critique and refinement among multiple agents to generate high-quality, covert harmful query transformations that can be used to improve future LLM safety alignment. Experiments demonstrate that HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations. At the same time, our analysis reveals that debate acts as a double-edged sword: while it can sharpen transformations and improve stealth, it may also introduce topic shifts and unnecessary complexity. These insights highlight both the promise and the limitations of multi-agent debate for generating comprehensive safety training data.

*Adam Kamel,Tanish Rastogi,Michael Ma,Kailash Ranganathan,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates large language models' ability to internalize and represent complex, incomplete information in games, using poker as an example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore whether transformer-based large language models can develop internal world models in domains of incomplete information, such as poker, similar to how they do in environments with perfect information.

Method: A GPT-style model was pretrained on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and its internal activations were analyzed using both deterministic and nonlinear probes.

Result: The model successfully learned deterministic (e.g., hand ranks) and stochastic (e.g., equity) structures, and its internal representations aligned with theoretical belief states in Texas Hold'em poker.

Conclusion: LLMs can encode and understand stochastic environments, like poker, and form representations that resemble theoretical belief states, without explicit prior instruction.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across diverse fields, from solving programming challenges to competing in strategy-intensive games such as chess. Prior work has shown that LLMs can develop emergent world models in games of perfect information, where internal representations correspond to latent states of the environment. In this paper, we extend this line of investigation to domains of incomplete information, focusing on poker as a canonical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We pretrain a GPT-style model on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and probe its internal activations. Our results demonstrate that the model learns both deterministic structure, such as hand ranks, and stochastic features, such as equity, without explicit instruction. Furthermore, by using primarily nonlinear probes, we demonstrated that these representations are decodeable and correlate with theoretical belief states, suggesting that LLMs are learning their own representation of the stochastic environment of Texas Hold'em Poker.

### [41] [When in Doubt, Deliberate: Confidence-Based Routing to Expert Debate for Sexism Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23732)
*Anwar Alajmi,Gabriele Pergola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges of detecting subtle sexist online content by proposing a two-stage framework, combining tailored training and reasoning-based inference, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subtle sexist content online evades detection due to label scarcity, class imbalance, noise, and conceptual ambiguity.

Method: The approach involves a two-stage framework: targeted training utilizing class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and calibrated thresholds, coupled with reasoning-based inference via a collaborative expert judgment module.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art results, improving F1 scores notably on EXIST 2025 Task 1.1 (+2.72%) and EDOS Tasks A (+4.48%) and B (+1.30%).

Conclusion: A novel framework effectively tackles the limitations of traditional detection methods for sexist content, offering improved performance through tailored training and selective inference mechanisms.

Abstract: Sexist content online increasingly appears in subtle, context-dependent forms that evade traditional detection methods. Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to adapt supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. Our training setup applies class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. At inference time, a dynamic routing mechanism classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a novel \textit{Collaborative Expert Judgment} (CEJ) module, which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks, with a +2.72\% improvement in F1 on the EXIST 2025 Task 1.1, and a gains of +4.48\% and +1.30\% on the EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively.

*Michaela Levi-Richter,Reuth Mirsky,Oren Glickman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a challenge and solution for robots to predict where household items are stored, using a hybrid vision-language model called NOAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty robots face in inferring the storage location of everyday items in domestic environments, which requires commonsense reasoning beyond vision and manipulation.

Method: They proposed the Stored Household Item Challenge benchmark and developed NOAM, a hybrid agent combining structured scene understanding with large language model inference to predict the storage location of household items.

Result: NOAM outperforms baseline models and achieves accuracy close to human-level performance in predicting the most likely storage location of household items.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and NOAM model advance robots' capabilities in making commonsense inferences in domestic environments, laying the groundwork for more cognitively capable service robots.

Abstract: ``Bring me a plate.'' For domestic service robots, this simple command reveals a complex challenge: inferring where everyday items are stored, often out of sight in drawers, cabinets, or closets. Despite advances in vision and manipulation, robots still lack the commonsense reasoning needed to complete this task. We introduce the Stored Household Item Challenge, a benchmark task for evaluating service robots' cognitive capabilities: given a household scene and a queried item, predict its most likely storage location.
  Our benchmark includes two datasets: (1) a real-world evaluation set of 100 item-image pairs with human-annotated ground truth from participants' kitchens, and (2) a development set of 6,500 item-image pairs annotated with storage polygons over public kitchen images. These datasets support realistic modeling of household organization and enable comparative evaluation across agent architectures.
  To begin tackling this challenge, we introduce NOAM (Non-visible Object Allocation Model), a hybrid agent pipeline that combines structured scene understanding with large language model inference. NOAM converts visual input into natural language descriptions of spatial context and visible containers, then prompts a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to infer the most likely hidden storage location. This integrated vision-language agent exhibits emergent commonsense reasoning and is designed for modular deployment within broader robotic systems.
  We evaluate NOAM against baselines including random selection, vision-language pipelines (Grounding-DINO + SAM), leading multimodal models (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o, Kosmos-2, LLaMA, Qwen), and human performance. NOAM significantly improves prediction accuracy and approaches human-level results, highlighting best practices for deploying cognitively capable agents in domestic environments.

### [43] [Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding Toward Improved LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23765)
*Tiancheng Su,Meicong Zhang,Guoxiu He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD) improves speculative decoding by dynamically using entropy to reject uncertain predictions, showing better performance and similar efficiency compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitation in standard speculative decoding arises from excessive alignment between the draft and target models, which restricts the output quality to the target model's performance.

Method: EASD integrates a dynamic, entropy-based penalty to manage high-uncertainty token predictions during decoding, rejecting and re-sampling tokens as needed to ensure higher reliability.

Result: EASD shows superior performance over standard speculative decoding methods, often surpassing the target large language model itself in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: EASD is an effective, training-free enhancement to speculative decoding that balances improved reasoning accuracy while maintaining comparable efficiency, showcasing its practical utility.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates large language model (LLM) reasoning by using a small draft model to generate candidate tokens, which the target LLM either accepts directly or regenerates upon rejection. However, excessive alignment between the draft and target models constrains SD to the performance of the target LLM. To address this limitation, we propose Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), a training-free enhancement. Building on standard SD, EASD incorporates a dynamic entropy-based penalty. At each decoding step, we employ the entropy of the sampling distribution to quantify model uncertainty. When both models exhibit high entropy with substantial overlap among their top-N predictions, the corresponding token is rejected and re-sampled by the target LLM. This penalty prevents low-confidence errors from propagating. By incorporating draft-model verification, EASD enables the possibility of surpassing the target model's inherent performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EASD consistently outperforms existing SD methods and, in most cases, surpasses the target LLM itself. We further prove that the efficiency of EASD is comparable to that of SD. The code can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

TL;DR: MiMo-Audio extends large-scale audio models to achieve few-shot learning capabilities, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in audio understanding, speech intelligence tasks, and novel applications like speech editing and style transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is driven by the gap in generalization capabilities of audio language models, aiming to emulate human-like few-shot learning in audio tasks, inspired by GPT-3's success in text models.

Method: By scaling pretraining data to over 100 million hours and introducing diverse instruction-tuning datasets with thinking mechanisms, MiMo-Audio achieves generalized audio task performance.

Result: MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on speech and audio benchmarks, generalizes to unseen tasks, and generates realistic audio outputs, while MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct advances benchmarks and rivals closed-source models.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the feasibility of scaling and adapting language model paradigms to audio tasks, making MiMo-Audio a significant open-source contribution to the field of audio AI.

Abstract: Existing audio language models typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning to accomplish particular audio tasks. In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing. MiMo-Audio-7B-Base also demonstrates powerful speech continuation capabilities, capable of generating highly realistic talk shows, recitations, livestreaming and debates. At the post-training stage, we curate a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduce thinking mechanisms into both audio understanding and generation. MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct achieves open-source SOTA on audio understanding benchmarks (MMSU, MMAU, MMAR, MMAU-Pro), spoken dialogue benchmarks (Big Bench Audio, MultiChallenge Audio) and instruct-TTS evaluations, approaching or surpassing closed-source models.

*Amal Alqahtani,Efsun Kayi,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes StressRoBERTa, a transfer learning model to improve chronic stress detection in English tweets; achieving superior performance compared to existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronic stress is a significant health concern, and social media serves as a platform for individuals to share such experiences. The paper explores leveraging clinical mental health data for better stress detection.

Method: StressRoBERTa uses RoBERTa model trained on the Stress-SMHD corpus, which includes tweets about depression, anxiety, PTSD, and fine-tuned using SMM4H 2022 dataset.

Result: StressRoBERTa achieves 82% F1-score, outperforming the best system by 3%. It shows strong representation when transferring from clinically related disorders to situational stress contexts (81% F1 on Dreaddit).

Conclusion: Cross-condition transfer learning using stress-related mental health data offers enhanced results for chronic stress detection, making StressRoBERTa effective.

Abstract: The prevalence of chronic stress represents a significant public health concern, with social media platforms like Twitter serving as important venues for individuals to share their experiences. This paper introduces StressRoBERTa, a cross-condition transfer learning approach for automatic detection of self-reported chronic stress in English tweets. The investigation examines whether continual training on clinically related conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD), disorders with high comorbidity with chronic stress, improves stress detection compared to general language models and broad mental health models. RoBERTa is continually trained on the Stress-SMHD corpus (108M words from users with self-reported diagnoses of depression, anxiety, and PTSD) and fine-tuned on the SMM4H 2022 Task 8 dataset. StressRoBERTa achieves 82% F1-score, outperforming the best shared task system (79% F1) by 3 percentage points. The results demonstrate that focused cross-condition transfer from stress-related disorders (+1% F1 over vanilla RoBERTa) provides stronger representations than general mental health training. Evaluation on Dreaddit (81% F1) further demonstrates transfer from clinical mental health contexts to situational stress discussions.

### [46] [Explaining News Bias Detection: A Comparative SHAP Analysis of Transformer Model Decision Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23835)
*Himel Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models, focusing on how they use linguistic signals to make predictions and why they fail. A domain-adaptive model performs better with fewer false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of how bias detection models make decisions and identify why they fail, which is essential for enhancing journalistic analysis and media accountability.

Method: The authors compare two bias detection models—a fine-tuned model on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the same dataset—using SHAP-based explanations to analyze word-level attributions.

Result: The domain-adaptive model aligns better with prediction outcomes, significantly reducing false positives by 63%, while the other model over-attributes evidence to incorrect predictions, leading to over-flagging of neutral content.

Conclusion: Architectural and training strategies significantly influence bias detection models' reliability and deployment efficacy in journalism. Interpretability analyses are critical to improve performance and align predictions with correctness.

Abstract: Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.

### [47] [Retrieval Augmented Question Answering: When Should LLMs Admit Ignorance?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23836)
*Dingmin Wang,Ji Ma,Shankar Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform in retrieval-augmented question answering and proposes an adaptive prompting strategy to improve performance while using fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longer contexts in retrieval-augmented generation can incorporate targeted knowledge but also risk introducing irrelevant information that hinders LLM performance.

Method: The authors propose an adaptive prompting strategy that splits retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompts an LLM while adjusting chunk size to balance relevant and irrelevant information.

Result: The adaptive strategy achieves comparable performance to standard prompting while using fewer tokens in experiments on three open-domain question answering datasets.

Conclusion: The findings suggest the need to improve LLMs' ability to decline requests when presented with insufficient information to reduce erroneous outputs.

Abstract: The success of expanded context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven increased use of broader context in retrieval-augmented generation. We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.

*Kaustubh Dhole*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores generating adversarial examples from intermediate attention-layer token distributions in language models to stress-test their evaluation pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To utilize intermediate attention-layer representations in language models for generating adversarial examples that refine token-level predictions and test model robustness.

Method: The approach generates adversarial examples by using token predictions from intermediate attention layers, leveraging their internal consistency instead of traditional prompt-based or gradient-based attacks. Experiments are conducted on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B.

Result: The attention-based adversarial examples cause noticeable drops in evaluation performance while maintaining semantic similarity to original inputs, though certain token substitutions harm grammatical quality.

Conclusion: Intermediate-layer token representations show potential for generating adversarial examples, but there are limitations due to occasional grammatical inconsistencies, requiring refinement for practical application.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability suggest that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses that are iteratively refined toward the final output. In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions, producing perturbations that are both plausible and internally consistent with the model's own generation process. We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using intermediate-layer representations as a principled source of adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM-based evaluation pipelines.

TL;DR: This study addresses the difficulty of financial numerical reasoning QA tasks due to a lack of domain knowledge, leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve performance in financial numerical reasoning QA tasks arises from the challenges of incorporating specific domain knowledge in finance and handling complex numeric reasoning with current models.

Method: The researchers implemented a multi-retriever RAG system to integrate external financial knowledge and question contexts, used an LLM, and conducted both domain-specific training with a SecBERT encoder and comprehensive experiments.

Result: The study found that domain-specific training significantly enhanced the model performance, surpassing the baseline FinQA model. The best prompt-based LLM generator achieved state-of-the-art performance with over 7% improvement, though still below human expert level.

Conclusion: Domain-specific training and retrieval augmentation improve financial QA, and the latest LLMs demonstrate enhanced capabilities, highlighting a trade-off between hallucinations and external knowledge. Larger models show significant gains from incorporating external facts.

Abstract: This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.

*Conrad Borchers,Manit Patel,Seiyon M. Lee,Anthony F. Botelho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses a method to separate the content of student responses from teacher grading biases using an analytics-focused framework, providing insights into grading practices and student reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve automated scoring systems for open-ended responses to distinguish genuine student understanding from teacher grading tendencies.

Method: The authors modeled teacher grading histories as dynamic priors, derived text representations from sentence embeddings, and used centering and residualization techniques to account for prompt and teacher biases. Linear models validated temporally were employed to quantify signal contributions.

Result: Teacher grading biases significantly influenced predictions, with the best results achieved by combining teacher priors and content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while models based solely on content were weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects improved embeddings by retaining meaningful dimensions and highlighting semantic evidence of understanding.

Conclusion: The paper developed a pipeline transforming generic embeddings into graded learning analytics, enabling qualitative assessment of grading alignment with evidence of student understanding.

Abstract: Open-ended responses are central to learning, yet automated scoring often conflates what students wrote with how teachers grade. We present an analytics-first framework that separates content signals from rater tendencies, making judgments visible and auditable via analytics. Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and derive text representations from sentence embeddings, incorporating centering and residualization to mitigate prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and a projection surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the residual content representation, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism for multi-step retrieval-augmented generation, improving reasoning and understanding by forming higher-order interactions in memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing memory systems in multi-step RAG, which passively store isolated facts without considering high-order correlations among facts, resulting in fragmented reasoning.

Method: The authors developed HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory structure where memory is represented as hyperedges in a hypergraph. This allows the memory to dynamically evolve and capture complex relationships for better reasoning and global understanding.

Result: HGMem significantly improves multi-step RAG performance and outperforms strong baseline systems in experiments on various global sense-making datasets.

Conclusion: Hypergraph-based memory mechanisms, as proposed in HGMem, enhance representational strength and reasoning capabilities in multi-step retrieval-augmented generation tasks, addressing limitations of traditional memory approaches.

Abstract: Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.

Motivation: To improve the efficiency of processing long-context scenarios while reducing computational cost for tasks requiring extensive token input.

Method: The authors designed LoZA, a sparse attention mechanism, and applied it during mid-training on LongCat-Flash, resulting in the LongCat-Flash-Exp model capable of handling up to 1 million tokens efficiently.

Result: LoZA demonstrated significant speed-ups for both prefill-intensive tasks (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) and decode-intensive tasks (e.g., tool-augmented reasoning).

Conclusion: The implementation of LoZA highlights its capability to enhance computational efficiency and enable long-term reasoning and agentic functionality in long-context foundation models.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat ZigZag Attention (LoZA), which is a sparse attention scheme designed to transform any existing full-attention models into sparse versions with rather limited compute budget. In long-context scenarios, LoZA can achieve significant speed-ups both for prefill-intensive (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) and decode-intensive (e.g., tool-integrated reasoning) cases. Specifically, by applying LoZA to LongCat-Flash during mid-training, we serve LongCat-Flash-Exp as a long-context foundation model that can swiftly process up to 1 million tokens, enabling efficient long-term reasoning and long-horizon agentic capabilities.

Abstract: Large-scale Chinese spelling correction (CSC) remains critical for real-world text processing, yet existing LLMs and supervised methods lack robustness to novel errors and rely on costly annotations. We introduce CEC-Zero, a zero-supervision reinforcement learning framework that addresses this by enabling LLMs to correct their own mistakes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an unsupervised framework that discovers reasoning vectors in large language models (LLMs) using sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) to explore and control reasoning behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in understanding and interpreting reasoning processes in large language models (LLMs), as current approaches based on supervised human-defined concepts are limited and cannot capture diverse reasoning behaviors.

Method: The authors propose RISE, an unsupervised framework based on sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) to discover reasoning vectors in LLMs' activation spaces. They segment chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level steps and analyze behaviors using these activations.

Result: SAEs reveal interpretable reasoning behaviors such as reflection, backtracking, and response confidence. These behaviors are separable in the activation space, and intervention on vectors can control reasoning behaviors without retraining.

Conclusion: The framework enables interpretable and manipulatable exploration of reasoning in LLMs, revealing latent reasoning features and offering new insights into their internal mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: Lightweight transformer models can perform as well as or better than baseline models, making them suitable for misinformation detection systems in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Distinguishing fake or untrue news from satire or humor poses a unique challenge due to their overlapping linguistic features and divergent intent. This study develops WISE (Web Information Satire and Fakeness Evaluation) framework which benchmarks eight lightweight transformer models alongside two baseline models on a balanced dataset of 20,000 samples from Fakeddit, annotated as either fake news or satire. Using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, we evaluate models across comprehensive metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, MCC, Brier score, and Expected Calibration Error. Our evaluation reveals that MiniLM, a lightweight model, achieves the highest accuracy (87.58%) among all models, while RoBERTa-base achieves the highest ROC-AUC (95.42%) and strong accuracy (87.36%). DistilBERT offers an excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-off with 86.28\% accuracy and 93.90\% ROC-AUC. Statistical tests confirm significant performance differences between models, with paired t-tests and McNemar tests providing rigorous comparisons. Our findings highlight that lightweight models can match or exceed baseline performance, offering actionable insights for deploying misinformation detection systems in real-world, resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of generating accurate and effective textual reasoning plans for large language models due to hallucinations and diverse task-specific questions.

Method: The proposed method, iCLP, involves distilling explicit reasoning plans into a latent representation using a vector-quantized autoencoder and fine-tuning LLMs to perform implicit reasoning with latent plans.

Result: The iCLP framework achieved improved accuracy and efficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving and code generation, with strong cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: With iCLP, LLMs exhibit improved reasoning capabilities in latent space, preserving interpretability and enhancing cross-task performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), when guided by explicit textual plans, can perform reliable step-by-step reasoning during problem-solving. However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.

### [57] [Beyond Hallucinations: A Composite Score for Measuring Reliability in Open-Source Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24058)
*Rohit Kumar Salla,Manoj Saravanan,Shrikar Reddy Kota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified metric combining calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification for evaluating large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of large language models in decision-critical domains remains uncertain, as they suffer from overconfident errors, degrade under input shifts, and lack clear uncertainty estimates.

Method: The Composite Reliability Score (CRS) combines multiple dimensions of reliability into a single metric. The paper assesses CRS through experiments on ten leading LLMs across five QA datasets under different conditions.

Result: CRS provides stable rankings of models, detects failure modes overlooked by individual metrics, and underscores the importance of balancing accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty.

Conclusion: CRS offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, improving understanding of model reliability and helping identify the most dependable systems for critical domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma are increasingly used in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, law, and finance, yet their reliability remains uncertain. They often make overconfident errors, degrade under input shifts, and lack clear uncertainty estimates. Existing evaluations are fragmented, addressing only isolated aspects. We introduce the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified framework that integrates calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification into a single interpretable metric. Through experiments on ten leading open-source LLMs across five QA datasets, we assess performance under baselines, perturbations, and calibration methods. CRS delivers stable model rankings, uncovers hidden failure modes missed by single metrics, and highlights that the most dependable systems balance accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop highly efficient machine translation models using a holistic training framework to achieve superior performance compared to significantly larger models and existing commercial APIs.

Method: Models are trained through a multi-stage pipeline involving general and MT-oriented pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and reinforcement learning to ensure high efficiency and performance.

Result: HY-MT1.5-1.8B efficiently outperforms larger open-source models and APIs while maintaining robust performance close to proprietary ultra-large models. HY-MT1.5-7B achieves new state-of-the-art performance in its size class.

Conclusion: HY-MT1.5 models present competitive solutions in machine translation across parameter scales, supporting advanced constraints and excelling in both general and specialized tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce our latest translation models, HY-MT1.5-1.8B and HY-MT1.5-7B, a new family of machine translation models developed through a holistic training framework tailored for high-performance translation. Our methodology orchestrates a multi-stage pipeline that integrates general and MT-oriented pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and reinforcement learning. HY-MT1.5-1.8B, the 1.8B-parameter model demonstrates remarkable parameter efficiency, comprehensively outperforming significantly larger open-source baselines (e.g., Tower-Plus-72B, Qwen3-32B) and mainstream commercial APIs (e.g., Microsoft Translator, Doubao Translator) in standard Chinese-foreign and English-foreign tasks. It achieves approximately 90% of the performance of ultra-large proprietary models such as Gemini-3.0-Pro, while marginally trailing Gemini-3.0-Pro on WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language benchmarks, it maintains a substantial lead over other competing models. Furthermore, HY-MT1.5-7B establishes a new state-of-the-art for its size class, achieving 95% of Gemini-3.0-Pro's performance on Flores-200 and surpassing it on the challenging WMT25 and Mandarin-minority language test sets. Beyond standard translation, the HY-MT1.5 series supports advanced constraints, including terminology intervention, context-aware translation, and format preservation. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm that both models offer highly competitive, robust solutions for general and specialized translation tasks within their respective parameter scales.

### [59] [Triangulation as an Acceptance Rule for Multilingual Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24842)
*Yanan Long*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal standard for analyzing multilingual language models via the concept of triangulation, ensuring mechanistic claims are robust across languages and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual models perform well overall but behave unpredictably across languages and cultures. A more stringent causal framework is needed to explain their behaviors comprehensively.

Method: The paper formalizes reference families to preserve meaning across variations and introduces a triangulation acceptance rule requiring necessity, sufficiency, and directional stability of mechanisms across diverse environments. These claims are tested using automatic circuit discovery and causal interventions.

Result: The proposed triangulation framework effectively identifies spurious claims and offers robust evaluations of model behavior across multiple languages, tasks, and environments.

Conclusion: Triangulation provides a rigorous, falsifiable framework for evaluating mechanistic claims, improving overall understanding and reliability of multilingual models.

Abstract: Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.

*Adi Shnaidman,Erin Feiglin,Osher Yaari,Efrat Mentel,Amit Levi,Raz Lapid*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new activation-steering framework to provide inference-time control in Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of effective mechanisms for inference-time control and attribute steering in MDLMs, which are critical for achieving more versatile and precise text generation.

Method: The study introduces a layer-wise steering approach that computes steering vectors based on contrastive examples using a single forward pass. These steering directions are applied iteratively during the reverse-diffusion steps of MDLMs.

Result: The method demonstrates effective control over high-level attributes in text generation, as validated on LLaDA-8B-Instruct datasets. Experiments explored the system's behavior when applied across different token scopes (prompt vs. response) and transformer sub-modules.

Conclusion: The framework achieves efficient inference-time control in MDLMs without simulating denoising trajectories, expanding their utility in structured text generation tasks and providing new opportunities for fine-grained modulation.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) generate text through an iterative denoising process. They have recently gained attention due to mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance with autoregressive large language models. However, effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering in MDLMs remain largely unexplored. We present an activation-steering framework for MDLMs that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, without simulating the denoising trajectory. These directions are applied at every reverse-diffusion step, yielding an efficient inference-time control mechanism. Experiments on LLaDA-8B-Instruct demonstrate reliable modulation of high-level attributes, with ablations examining the effects of steering across transformer sub-modules and token scope (prompt vs.\ response).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Large Emotional World Model (LEWM) that incorporates emotion into world models, showing it improves understanding and prediction of emotion-driven social behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic exploration of emotional factors in existing world models and demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world.

Method: The authors developed the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset to integrate emotion into causal reasoning and built the LEWM, which explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions.

Result: LEWM improves the prediction of emotion-driven social behaviors and maintains comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.

Conclusion: Emotion plays a critical role in world modeling, and LEWM effectively incorporates emotional reasoning in understanding and predicting dynamic world states.

Abstract: World Models serve as tools for understanding the current state of the world and predicting its future dynamics, with broad application potential across numerous fields. As a key component of world knowledge, emotion significantly influences human decision-making. While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown preliminary capability in capturing world knowledge, they primarily focus on modeling physical-world regularities and lack systematic exploration of emotional factors. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions. Experimental results show that LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.

TL;DR: MedKGI is a diagnostic framework addressing limitations in LLM-driven clinical diagnosis by grounding reasoning in a medical knowledge graph, optimizing inquiry efficiency, and ensuring dialogue coherence, outperforming strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of LLMs in clinical diagnosis, such as hallucinated content, inefficient questioning, and dialogue incoherence.

Method: MedKGI leverages a medical knowledge graph for grounding, employs information-gain-driven question selection, and uses an OSCE-format structured state for consistent evidence tracking.

Result: MedKGI demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy and question efficiency, achieving a 30% improvement in dialogue efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: MedKGI robustly addresses critical limitations of LLMs, advancing efficiency and accuracy in clinical diagnostic reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise in clinical diagnosis. However, current models struggle to emulate the iterative, diagnostic hypothesis-driven reasoning of real clinical scenarios. Specifically, current LLMs suffer from three critical limitations: (1) generating hallucinated medical content due to weak grounding in verified knowledge, (2) asking redundant or inefficient questions rather than discriminative ones that hinder diagnostic progress, and (3) losing coherence over multi-turn dialogues, leading to contradictory or inconsistent conclusions. To address these challenges, we propose MedKGI, a diagnostic framework grounded in clinical practices. MedKGI integrates a medical knowledge graph (KG) to constrain reasoning to validated medical ontologies, selects questions based on information gain to maximize diagnostic efficiency, and adopts an OSCE-format structured state to maintain consistent evidence tracking across turns. Experiments on clinical benchmarks show that MedKGI outperforms strong LLM baselines in both diagnostic accuracy and inquiry efficiency, improving dialogue efficiency by 30% on average while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between patents and scientific publications by creating a robust language similarity model.

Method: Fine-tuned the SPECTER2 model on patents (Pat-SPECTER) and evaluated its performance against other models in predicting Patent-Paper Citations.

Result: Pat-SPECTER outperforms other models in tasks like distinguishing and predicting patent-paper pairs, and offers valuable insights into citation patterns.

Conclusion: Pat-SPECTER is a superior tool for researchers handling patents and scientific papers, with open access to the academic and practitioner communities.

Abstract: We develop a language similarity model suitable for working with patents and scientific publications at the same time. In a horse race-style evaluation, we subject eight language (similarity) models to predict credible Patent-Paper Citations. We find that our Pat-SPECTER model performs best, which is the SPECTER2 model fine-tuned on patents. In two real-world scenarios (separating patent-paper-pairs and predicting patent-paper-pairs) we demonstrate the capabilities of the Pat-SPECTER. We finally test the hypothesis that US patents cite papers that are semantically less similar than in other large jurisdictions, which we posit is because of the duty of candor. The model is open for the academic community and practitioners alike.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DATAMASK introduces a joint learning framework for selecting pre-training data to optimize both quality and diversity metrics. This approach reduces time by 98.9% while improving model performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-training large language models requires efficient and effective data selection processes, combining quality and diversity metrics to boost model capabilities and minimize computational costs.

Method: DATAMASK treats data selection as a mask learning problem, leveraging iterative sampling, policy gradients, accelerated optimization, and mask updating for efficient data filtering.

Result: With DATAMASK, a subset of 10% (1.5 trillion tokens) of FineWeb data was chosen, leading to performance gains of 3.2% for 1.5B dense models and 1.9% for 7B MoE models across 12 tasks.

Conclusion: DATAMASK provides a scalable solution to unify quality and diversity metrics in pre-training data selection, improving model performance while drastically reducing processing time.

Abstract: A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of automating EU Taxonomy compliance using large language models (LLMs) and introduces a novel dataset to benchmark their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of public datasets that restrict research progress in automating the EU Taxonomy compliance process using LLMs.

Method: The authors created a structured dataset from 190 corporate reports, containing ground-truth activities and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and evaluated LLMs on qualitative and quantitative compliance tasks.

Result: LLMs showed moderate success in identifying economic activities (qualitative task) but performed poorly in predicting financial KPIs (quantitative task). Metadata performed better than full reports, and confidence scores were poorly calibrated.

Conclusion: LLMs are not yet capable of full automation for EU Taxonomy compliance but can serve as assistive tools. The introduced dataset offers a basis for future research and improvement.

Abstract: The manual, resource-intensive process of complying with the EU Taxonomy presents a significant challenge for companies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, research is hindered by a lack of public benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, structured dataset from 190 corporate reports, containing ground-truth economic activities and quantitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We use this dataset to conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs on the core compliance workflow. Our results reveal a clear performance gap between qualitative and quantitative tasks. LLMs show moderate success in the qualitative task of identifying economic activities, with a multi-step agentic framework modestly enhancing precision. Conversely, the models comprehensively fail at the quantitative task of predicting financial KPIs in a zero-shot setting. We also discover a paradox, where concise metadata often yields superior performance to full, unstructured reports, and find that model confidence scores are poorly calibrated. We conclude that while LLMs are not ready for full automation, they can serve as powerful assistive tools for human experts. Our dataset provides a public benchmark for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of text-based reasoning models in capturing spatial, geometric, and structural relationships for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: The paper proposes FIGR, a system that uses end-to-end reinforcement learning to adaptively invoke visual reasoning during problem solving, incorporating visual representations of structural hypotheses.

Result: FIGR outperforms text-only models, achieving 13.12% improvement on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME benchmarks, demonstrating more coherent and stable reasoning.

Conclusion: Integrating visual reasoning through FIGR yields significant gains in multimodal reasoning, making it a promising approach for complex reasoning tasks requiring global structural understanding.

Abstract: Complex reasoning problems often involve implicit spatial, geometric, and structural relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. While recent reasoning models have achieved strong performance across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to represent global structural constraints in complex settings. In this paper, we introduce FIGR, which integrates active visual thinking into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines. In particular, FIGR improves the base model by 13.12% on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME, highlighting the effectiveness of figure-guided multimodal reasoning in enhancing the stability and reliability of complex reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces QianfanHuijin, a financial domain-specific LLM, and outlines a multi-stage training approach to enhance its performance in financial reasoning and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for LLMs in financial services that go beyond domain knowledge to include robust reasoning and agentic capabilities.

Method: The method comprises multi-stage training: (1) Continual Pre-training for a solid knowledge base, (2) financial-specific supervised and reinforcement learning (Financial SFT, Reasoning RL, Agentic RL), and (3) General RL targeting real-world applications.

Result: QianfanHuijin exceeds performance on financial benchmarks and exhibits significant gains in financial reasoning and agentic capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-stage training paradigm is effective and could become a standard for enhancing industrial LLMs across various domains.

Abstract: Domain-specific enhancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the financial context has long been a focal point of industrial application. While previous models such as BloombergGPT and Baichuan-Finance primarily focused on knowledge enhancement, the deepening complexity of financial services has driven a growing demand for models that possess not only domain knowledge but also robust financial reasoning and agentic capabilities. In this paper, we present QianfanHuijin, a financial domain LLM, and propose a generalizable multi-stage training paradigm for industrial model enhancement.
  Our approach begins with Continual Pre-training (CPT) on financial corpora to consolidate the knowledge base. This is followed by a fine-grained Post-training pipeline designed with increasing specificity: starting with Financial SFT, progressing to Finance Reasoning RL and Finance Agentic RL, and culminating in General RL aligned with real-world business scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate that QianfanHuijin achieves superior performance across various authoritative financial benchmarks. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that the targeted Reasoning RL and Agentic RL stages yield significant gains in their respective capabilities. These findings validate our motivation and suggest that this fine-grained, progressive post-training methodology is poised to become a mainstream paradigm for various industrial-enhanced LLMs.

*Keito Inoshita,Shinnosuke Mizuno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents WM-SAR, a sarcasm understanding method that combines LLMs' reasoning with interpretable modeling, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of sarcasm detection, which involves understanding surface-literal discrepancies, context, and intentions, in a way that is interpretable and captures underlying cognitive factors.

Method: The proposed WM-SAR decomposes sarcasm understanding into components (literal meaning, context, normative expectation, intention) using specialized LLM agents, then integrates inconsistency and intention scores with a logistic regression model.

Result: WM-SAR demonstrated superior performance compared to current deep learning and LLM methods on standard sarcasm detection datasets and offered enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: WM-SAR bridges interpretability with high-performance sarcasm detection by leveraging LLM reasoning and explicitly modeling semantic and intention-based inconsistencies, setting a new direction for sarcasm understanding.

Abstract: Sarcasm understanding is a challenging problem in natural language processing, as it requires capturing the discrepancy between the surface meaning of an utterance and the speaker's intentions as well as the surrounding social context. Although recent advances in deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially improved performance, most existing approaches still rely on black-box predictions of a single model, making it difficult to structurally explain the cognitive factors underlying sarcasm. Moreover, while sarcasm often emerges as a mismatch between semantic evaluation and normative expectations or intentions, frameworks that explicitly decompose and model these components remain limited. In this work, we reformulate sarcasm understanding as a world model inspired reasoning process and propose World Model inspired SArcasm Reasoning (WM-SAR), which decomposes literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM-based agents. The discrepancy between literal evaluation and normative expectation is explicitly quantified as a deterministic inconsistency score, and together with an intention score, these signals are integrated by a lightweight Logistic Regression model to infer the final sarcasm probability. This design leverages the reasoning capability of LLMs while maintaining an interpretable numerical decision structure. Experiments on representative sarcasm detection benchmarks show that WM-SAR consistently outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods. Ablation studies and case analyses further demonstrate that integrating semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning is essential for effective sarcasm detection, achieving both strong performance and high interpretability.

Method: The paper proposes a method where a section of a document is randomly masked. A contrastive learning objective, inspired by natural language inference (NLI), aligns this masked section with related parts of the document while separating it from unrelated parts.

Result: Experiments on legal and biomedical texts show significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency for long document representation.

Conclusion: The proposed method closely mimics human information synthesis and achieves richer, more computationally efficient document representations than existing approaches.

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown strong performance in word- and sentence-level tasks, effectively representing long documents, especially in fields like law and medicine, remains difficult. Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

### [73] [Comparing Approaches to Automatic Summarization in Less-Resourced Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24410)
*Chester Palen-Michel,Constantine Lignos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores summarization in less-resourced languages using various approaches, revealing multilingual fine-tuned models perform better than zero-shot LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limited focus on text summarization for less-resourced languages in comparison to high-resourced ones like English.

Method: Comparison of different methods including large language models (LLMs), translations, data augmentation, fine-tuning mT5, and multilingual transfer to evaluate summarization.

Result: The multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms zero-shot LLM approaches and reveals inconsistencies in LLMs' judgment on certain languages.

Conclusion: Tailored multilingual fine-tuning improves summarization for less-resourced languages over alternative methods like zero-shot prompting or translation pipelines.

Abstract: Automatic text summarization has achieved high performance in high-resourced languages like English, but comparatively less attention has been given to summarization in less-resourced languages. This work compares a variety of different approaches to summarization from zero-shot prompting of LLMs large and small to fine-tuning smaller models like mT5 with and without three data augmentation approaches and multilingual transfer. We also explore an LLM translation pipeline approach, translating from the source language to English, summarizing and translating back. Evaluating with five different metrics, we find that there is variation across LLMs in their performance across similar parameter sizes, that our multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms most other approaches including zero-shot LLM performance for most metrics, and that LLM as judge may be less reliable on less-resourced languages.

*Michael E. Rose,Nils A. Herrmann,Sebastian Erhardt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a language model for cleaning scientific abstracts, removing extraneous information to improve document similarity and embedding analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the distortion caused by extraneous information in scientific abstracts during textual analyses and embeddings.

Method: The paper develops an open-source and precise language model that identifies and removes clutter from English-language scientific abstracts.

Result: The model demonstrates improved similarity rankings and enhances the information content of embeddings for cleaned abstracts.

Conclusion: This model effectively cleans scientific abstracts, enhancing their utility for downstream analyses and embedding applications.

Abstract: Scientific abstracts are often used as proxies for the content and thematic focus of research publications. However, a significant share of published abstracts contains extraneous information-such as publisher copyright statements, section headings, author notes, registrations, and bibliometric or bibliographic metadata-that can distort downstream analyses, particularly those involving document similarity or textual embeddings. We introduce an open-source, easy-to-integrate language model designed to clean English-language scientific abstracts by automatically identifying and removing such clutter. We demonstrate that our model is both conservative and precise, alters similarity rankings of cleaned abstracts and improves information content of standard-length embeddings.

*Titas Ramancauskas,Kotryna Ramancauske*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a revision platform for IELTS writing exams, utilizing a transformer-based scoring model and adaptive feedback, showing improvement in candidates' scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IELTS prep lacks personalized feedback aligned with its rubric, leading to suboptimal writing evaluation and improvement methods.

Method: Iterative Design-Based Research (DBR) developed an Automated Essay Scoring system using a DistilBERT regression model for targeted feedback and improved scoring.

Result: The revised model achieved MAE of 0.66 with statistically significant improvements in candidate scores (+0.060 bands, p=0.011). Effectiveness depends on revision strategies.

Conclusion: Automated feedback is best suited as a supplementary tool to human instruction. Future work should focus on longitudinal validation and higher-band essay assessment.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a proposed revision platform assisting candidates for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) writing exam. Traditional IELTS preparation methods lack personalised feedback, catered to the IELTS writing rubric. To address these shortcomings, the platform features an attractive user interface (UI), an Automated Essay Scoring system (AES), and targeted feedback tailored to candidates and the IELTS writing rubric. The platform architecture separates conversational guidance from a dedicated writing interface to reduce cognitive load and simulate exam conditions. Through iterative, Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles, the study progressed from rule-based to transformer-based with a regression head scoring, mounted with adaptive feedback.
  Early cycles (2-3) revealed fundamental limitations of rule-based approaches: mid-band compression, low accuracy, and negative $R^2$ values. DBR Cycle 4 implemented a DistilBERT transformer model with a regression head, yielding substantial improvements with MAE of 0.66 and positive $R^2$. This enabled Cycle 5's adaptive feedback implementation, which demonstrated statistically significant score improvements (mean +0.060 bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504), though effectiveness varied by revision strategy. Findings suggest automated feedback functions are most suited as a supplement to human instruction, with conservative surface-level corrections proving more reliable than aggressive structural interventions for IELTS preparation contexts. Challenges remain in assessing higher-band essays, and future work should incorporate longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates and validation from official examiners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper establishes benchmarks and methods for paragraph segmentation in speech transcripts, tackling gaps in both the speech and text segmentation fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic speech transcripts lack readability due to unstructured word streams, and paragraph segmentation has been underexplored as a solution.

Method: The authors create benchmarks (TEDPara and YTSegPara), propose a constrained-decoding approach for inserting paragraph breaks with large language models, and develop a compact, efficient model (MiniSeg) for chapter and paragraph segmentation.

Result: The proposed benchmarks and methods achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and low computational costs, demonstrating their utility in making paragraph segmentation practical for speech processing.

Conclusion: This work establishes paragraph segmentation as an essential and standardized task in speech processing, with notable contributions to both speech and text segmentation fields.

Abstract: Automatic speech transcripts are often delivered as unstructured word streams that impede readability and repurposing. We recast paragraph segmentation as the missing structuring step and fill three gaps at the intersection of speech processing and text segmentation. First, we establish TEDPara (human-annotated TED talks) and YTSegPara (YouTube videos with synthetic labels) as the first benchmarks for the paragraph segmentation task. The benchmarks focus on the underexplored speech domain, where paragraph segmentation has traditionally not been part of post-processing, while also contributing to the wider text segmentation field, which still lacks robust and naturalistic benchmarks. Second, we propose a constrained-decoding formulation that lets large language models insert paragraph breaks while preserving the original transcript, enabling faithful, sentence-aligned evaluation. Third, we show that a compact model (MiniSeg) attains state-of-the-art accuracy and, when extended hierarchically, jointly predicts chapters and paragraphs with minimal computational cost. Together, our resources and methods establish paragraph segmentation as a standardized, practical task in speech processing.

TL;DR: The paper audits LLMs using a novel HausaSafety dataset, revealing context-dependent safety gaps affected by linguistic and temporal factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dangerous assumption that multilingual safety seamlessly transfers in LLMs without proper evaluation.

Method: A systematic audit of GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus using the HausaSafety dataset in West African scenarios, employing a 2 x 4 factorial design.

Result: Complex Interference and Reverse Linguistic effects were observed, where models performed differently across languages, with temporal framing causing significant volatility.

Conclusion: Current models rely on superficial heuristics, exposing users to harm; the authors suggest adopting Invariant Alignment to achieve robust, context-independent safety measures.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into critical global infrastructure, the assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages remains a dangerous blind spot. This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HaluNet, a framework for detecting hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining multiple types of uncertainties in predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing hallucinations in LLMs is crucial for improving factual accuracy in QA systems, and detecting them via internal uncertainty signals is scalable and does not rely on external resources.

Method: HaluNet integrates multiple uncertainty sources using a multi-branch neural architecture that combines token-level probability uncertainty and semantic representations, offering an efficient one-pass approach for hallucination detection.

Result: HaluNet demonstrates strong detection performance and computational efficiency across multiple QA datasets, even without full context.

Conclusion: HaluNet provides a promising solution for real-time hallucination detection in LLM-based question-answering systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at question answering (QA) but often generate hallucinations, including factual errors or fabricated content. Detecting hallucinations from internal uncertainty signals is attractive due to its scalability and independence from external resources. Existing methods often aim to accurately capture a single type of uncertainty while overlooking the complementarity among different sources, particularly between token-level probability uncertainty and the uncertainty conveyed by internal semantic representations, which provide complementary views on model reliability. We present \textbf{HaluNet}, a lightweight and trainable neural framework that integrates multi granular token level uncertainties by combining semantic embeddings with probabilistic confidence and distributional uncertainty. Its multi branch architecture adaptively fuses what the model knows with the uncertainty expressed in its outputs, enabling efficient one pass hallucination detection. Experiments on SQuAD, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions show that HaluNet delivers strong detection performance and favorable computational efficiency, with or without access to context, highlighting its potential for real time hallucination detection in LLM based QA systems.

*Hongseok Oh,Wonseok Hwang,Kyoung-Woon On*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL) to assess language models' legal reasoning while minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge. The benchmark highlights significant reasoning performance gaps in current models. Resources are made available online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to create a benchmark that evaluates language models' legal reasoning capabilities independently of their domain-specific knowledge, allowing a clearer understanding of reasoning ability.

Method: The Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL) consists of two components: (1) KCL-MCQA, a multiple-choice question set with supporting precedents, and (2) KCL-Essay, a set of open-ended questions with detailed scoring rubrics. Both are used to test and evaluate reasoning capabilities systematically.

Result: The evaluation of over 30 models showed significant performance gaps, particularly in the open-ended KCL-Essay tasks. Reasoning-specialized models consistently performed better than general-purpose models.

Conclusion: The study confirms the need for improved legal reasoning capacities in language models and demonstrates that reasoning-specialized models perform much better. KCL serves as an effective tool for this evaluation, and all resources are publicly released for further research.

Abstract: We introduce the Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL), a benchmark designed to assess language models' legal reasoning capabilities independently of domain-specific knowledge. KCL provides question-level supporting precedents, enabling a more faithful disentanglement of reasoning ability from parameterized knowledge. KCL consists of two components: (1) KCL-MCQA, multiple-choice problems of 283 questions with 1,103 aligned precedents, and (2) KCL-Essay, open-ended generation problems of 169 questions with 550 aligned precedents and 2,739 instance-level rubrics for automated evaluation. Our systematic evaluation of 30+ models shows large remaining gaps, particularly in KCL-Essay, and that reasoning-specialized models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CREST, a method to optimize LLM reasoning by suppressing inefficient cognitive behaviors, improving accuracy by up to 17.5% and reducing token usage by 37.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often exhibit inefficiency and instability in reasoning, leading to high computational costs and suboptimal accuracy. This paper seeks to address these inefficiencies in reasoning trajectories.

Method: The authors studied reasoning trajectories and identified specialized attention heads correlated with cognitive behaviors. They developed CREST, a training-free test-time method, combining offline calibration of steering vectors and inference-time rotation of hidden representations to suppress unproductive behaviors.

Result: CREST improves reasoning accuracy by up to 17.5% and reduces token usage during inference by 37.6% across various benchmarks and models.

Conclusion: CREST represents a practical pathway to enhancing LLM reasoning efficiency, achieving faster results and higher reliability without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: Youtu-LLM is a 1.96B parameter lightweight language model offering strong reasoning, planning, and long-context support for agentic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create a small yet highly capable language model capable of advanced reasoning, planning, and agentic behavior without distillation, to challenge the limitations of lightweight models.

Method: The model uses a Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture supported by a novel vocabulary and a 128k context window. A three-stage training strategy shifts from general commonsense to STEM and agentic-specific datasets, with scalable agentic mid-training focused on math, coding, and tool use.

Result: Youtu-LLM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for sub-2B parameter models, achieving competitive results on general tasks and surpassing benchmarks in agent-specific scenarios.

Conclusion: This work shows that lightweight models can achieve advanced agentic and reasoning capabilities through careful architectural design and training strategies, providing a powerful alternative to larger models.

Abstract: We introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled "Commonsense-STEM-Agent" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.

*Casey O. Barkan,Sid Black,Oliver Sourbut*

TL;DR: The paper examines how well large language models (LLMs) predict their own success on tasks, finding that they often overestimate their abilities, though some models adapt with experience. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to evaluate the self-awareness of LLMs regarding their own capabilities and to understand whether such awareness influences decision-making in high-stakes tasks.

Method: They analyze LLMs' self-predicted success across different tasks, including multi-step scenarios, observing whether experience alters predictions and decision-making.

Result: The study finds that LLMs are overconfident but generally predict success better than random guessing. Experience sometimes improves prediction accuracy in some models, but overconfidence often remains. 

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limited self-awareness of their abilities, leading to overly optimistic predictions and poor decision-making. This highlights challenges in ensuring reliability and reducing risks associated with AI misalignment.

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.

*Maoyuan Li,Zhongsheng Wang,Haoyuan Li,Jiamou Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-Debater, a framework for generating multi-turn debates using argumentative memory and evaluation benchmarks, outperforming strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for systems that can generate coherent, stance-consistent, and evidence-based multi-turn debates, grounded in principles of rhetoric and memory studies.

Method: R-Debater incorporates a debate knowledge base to retrieve case evidence and prior arguments, alongside a role-based agent for composing debates. It is evaluated on both single and multi-turn debate tasks using new benchmarks and human assessments.

Result: R-Debater outperforms strong language model baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn debate generation tasks, validated by human evaluators on measures like consistency, evidence use, and coherence.

Conclusion: The integration of retrieval grounding and structured planning techniques makes R-Debater effective at generating more coherent, stance-aligned debates, supporting claims with evidence more faithfully than baseline systems.

Abstract: We present R-Debater, an agentic framework for generating multi-turn debates built on argumentative memory. Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUSIC, an unsupervised data augmentation strategy to improve multi-turn reward models (RMs) for evaluating conversations by leveraging contrasts across multiple conversational turns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in evaluating multi-turn conversations, which are crucial for advanced LLM development, by enhancing signal quality beyond single-turn contrasts.

Method: Proposes MUSIC, a strategy that synthesizes multi-turn contrastive conversation pairs for training multi-turn RMs based on the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model.

Result: MUSIC-augmented RMs outperformed baseline methods, showing higher alignment with proprietary LLM judgments, while maintaining single-turn RM benchmark performance.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-turn contrasts via MUSIC improves RM effectiveness on multi-turn conversations without sacrificing single-turn evaluation capability.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn conversations is crucial for developing capable Large Language Models (LLMs), yet remains a significant challenge, often requiring costly human evaluation. Multi-turn reward models (RMs) offer a scalable alternative and can provide valuable signals for guiding LLM training. While recent work has advanced multi-turn \textit{training} techniques, effective automated \textit{evaluation} specifically for multi-turn interactions lags behind. We observe that standard preference datasets, typically contrasting responses based only on the final conversational turn, provide insufficient signal to capture the nuances of multi-turn interactions. Instead, we find that incorporating contrasts spanning \textit{multiple} turns is critical for building robust multi-turn RMs. Motivated by this finding, we propose \textbf{MU}lti-\textbf{S}tep \textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{C}ontrast (MUSIC), an unsupervised data augmentation strategy that synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs exhibiting differences across multiple turns. Leveraging MUSIC on the Skywork preference dataset, we train a multi-turn RM based on the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model. Empirical results demonstrate that our MUSIC-augmented RM outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher alignment with judgments from advanced proprietary LLM judges on multi-turn conversations, crucially, without compromising performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address structural limitations in pathway enrichment workflows and provide a standardized benchmark for multi-omics mechanism elucidation.

Method: Introduce BIOME-Bench, a benchmark with rigorous evaluation protocols targeting two LLM capabilities: biomolecular interaction inference and pathway mechanism elucidation. Experiments use various contemporary models.

Result: The experiments reveal that current models struggle with distinguishing biomolecular relation types and generating robust, accurate explanations.

Conclusion: Existing models are inadequate for reliable analysis in multi-omics pathway mechanism elucidation, emphasizing the need for improvement.

Abstract: Multi-omics studies often rely on pathway enrichment to interpret heterogeneous molecular changes, but pathway enrichment (PE)-based workflows inherit structural limitations of pathway resources, including curation lag, functional redundancy, and limited sensitivity to molecular states and interventions. Although recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to improve PE-based interpretation, the lack of a standardized benchmark for end-to-end multi-omics pathway mechanism elucidation has largely confined evaluation to small, manually curated datasets or ad hoc case studies, hindering reproducible progress. To address this issue, we introduce BIOME-Bench, constructed via a rigorous four-stage workflow, to evaluate two core capabilities of LLMs in multi-omics analysis: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and end-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation. We develop evaluation protocols for both tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple strong contemporary models. Experimental results demonstrate that existing models still exhibit substantial deficiencies in multi-omics analysis, struggling to reliably distinguish fine-grained biomolecular relation types and to generate faithful, robust pathway-level mechanistic explanations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenges in depression detection from multilingual and informal social media text, particularly the scarcity of annotated data in certain languages.

Method: The authors propose Semi-SMDNet, a framework combining teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning via soft voting, and confidence-weighted training to enhance detection accuracy across languages.

Result: Semi-SMDNet outperforms strong baselines and significantly narrows the performance gap between resource-rich and resource-limited settings, as shown by tests on datasets in Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness and robustness, making it suitable for scalable cross-language mental health monitoring in scenarios with limited labelled resources.

Abstract: Detecting depression from social media text is still a challenging task. This is due to different language styles, informal expression, and the lack of annotated data in many languages. To tackle these issues, we propose, Semi-SMDNet, a strong Semi-Supervised Multilingual Depression detection Network. It combines teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and augmentation of data. Our framework uses a group of teacher models. Their predictions come together through soft voting. An uncertainty-based threshold filters out low-confidence pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve learning stability. We also use a confidence-weighted training method that focuses on reliable pseudo-labelled samples. This greatly boosts robustness across languages. Tests on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets show that our approach consistently beats strong baselines. It significantly reduces the performance gap between settings that have plenty of resources and those that do not. Detailed experiments and studies confirm that our framework is effective and can be used in various situations. This shows that it is suitable for scalable, cross-language mental health monitoring where labelled resources are limited.

Result: The Mixture of Experts architecture is identified as balancing performance and efficiency well. Additionally, findings reveal diminishing accuracy returns beyond a compute threshold.

Conclusion: While LLMs benefit from advanced reasoning capabilities, there are intrinsic computational and accuracy limits that necessitate careful model and resource trade-offs for practical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are demonstrating rapid improvements on complex reasoning benchmarks, particularly when allowed to utilize intermediate reasoning steps before converging on a final solution. However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for ethical considerations in NLP education amidst the field's rapid evolution.

Method: The course employs active learning methods such as interactive sessions, hands-on activities, and 'learning by teaching,' aiming to foster critical thinking.

Result: The course has been refined across institutions and generated reusable teaching materials and educational products made by students for diverse audiences.

*Srija Mukhopadhyay,Sathwik Reddy,Shruthi Muthukumar,Jisun An,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the privacy risks of AI agents accessing sensitive user data and introduces a benchmark, PrivacyBench, to measure these risks. Current AI systems are found to leak secrets and require structural improvements for ethical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the societal and privacy risks posed by AI agents' access to sensitive user data, such as private emails and purchase histories, leading to potential secret leaks and digital harm.

Method: The authors developed PrivacyBench, a benchmark with datasets containing secrets, and conducted multi-turn conversational evaluations to test secret preservation within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI systems.

Result: Testing revealed that AI systems can leak user secrets in 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt reduces leakage to 5.12%, but retrieval mechanisms still access sensitive data indiscriminately, making privacy preservation incomplete.

Conclusion: The current architectures of AI systems are unsafe for broad deployment due to inconsistent privacy safeguarding. Structural, privacy-by-design approaches are essential to developing ethical and inclusive technologies.

Abstract: Personalized AI agents rely on access to a user's digital footprint, which often includes sensitive data from private emails, chats and purchase histories. Yet this access creates a fundamental societal and privacy risk: systems lacking social-context awareness can unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator. This creates a single point of failure, rendering current architectures unsafe for wide-scale deployment. Our findings underscore the urgent need for structural, privacy-by-design safeguards to ensure an ethical and inclusive web for everyone.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Encyclo-K, a new statement-based benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs), which addresses limitations of existing question-based benchmarks, such as data contamination, single-point assessment, and high annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional question-based benchmarks that are prone to data contamination, restricted knowledge assessment, and costly annotation processes, and to create a more robust and scalable evaluation framework for LLMs.

Method: Developing Encyclo-K, a benchmark based on knowledge statements extracted from authoritative textbooks, which are then dynamically composed into multi-statement evaluation questions at test time; ensuring broader knowledge assessment and reducing annotation effort.

Result: Encyclo-K effectively discriminates LLM performance, with the best current model achieving 62.07% accuracy. The performance distribution highlights the challenge of multi-statement reasoning, with reasoning models outperforming chat-based ones.

Conclusion: Encyclo-K provides a scalable, reliable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding, addressing critical benchmarking challenges. It sets a new standard for assessing models on multidisciplinary and fine-grained knowledge.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a framework improving upon Hyper-Connections by restoring identity mapping, reducing training instability, and enhancing scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Hyper-Connections provide performance gains but compromise the identity mapping property, leading to training instability, scalability issues, and memory overhead.

Method: The authors propose mHC to constrain the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold and optimize infrastructure for efficient scaling.

Result: Experiments demonstrate mHC's efficacy in enhancing training scalability and achieving better performance.

Conclusion: mHC improves upon HC as a scalable, efficient design, guiding topological architecture evolution and foundational model development.

Abstract: Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.

*Hengli Li,Zhaoxin Yu,Qi Shen,Chenxi Li,Mengmeng Wang,Tinglang Wu,Yipeng Kang,Yuxuan Wang,Song-Chun Zhu,Zixia Jia,Zilong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Strategic dialogue requires belief estimation and dialogue acts, and this paper introduces a framework (BEDA) using probabilistic constraints to achieve reliability and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research focuses on belief estimation but lacks robust mechanisms to utilize those beliefs during conversation generation. This gap hinders effective strategic dialogue.

Method: The paper defines core dialogue acts: Adversarial and Alignment, operationalized via probabilistic constraints. It presents BEDA framework consisting of belief estimators, a world set, and a conditional generator to align utterances with inferred beliefs.

Result: BEDA consistently outperforms baseline methods in strategic dialogue tasks: improving success rates in adversarial and cooperative settings, and achieving optimal negotiations across GPT-4.1-nano and other settings.

Conclusion: Using belief estimation as constraints provides a generalizable and effective approach to achieve improved performance across diverse strategic dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.

*Minjun Zhao,Xinyu Zhang,Shuai Zhang,Deyang Li,Ruifeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADOPT is a framework designed to optimize prompts in multi-step LLM pipelines, addressing dependencies and lack of step-level supervision, improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step LLM pipelines are effective for complex tasks, but their performance depends heavily on prompt quality, which is hard to optimize jointly due to inter-step dependencies and lack of direct supervision.

Method: ADOPT uses dependency modeling to estimate text gradients for prompt optimization, adapts a Shapley mechanism for resource allocation, and simplifies optimization to single-prompt steps.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ADOPT delivers superior and stable performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on diverse datasets and pipeline structures.

Conclusion: ADOPT provides an adaptive and robust solution for optimizing prompts in multi-step LLM pipelines, maximizing task outcomes with improved reliability.

Abstract: Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.

### [97] [Modeling Language as a Sequence of Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25026)
*Nasim Borazjanizadeh,James McClelland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that improves language modeling by incorporating sentence-level 'thought' representations alongside tokens, addressing inefficiencies seen in standard Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Transformer models rely heavily on surface-level statistics and lack structured latent representations of entities/events, leading to errors in relational direction and contextualization. Cognitive science shows humans create event-like compact representations, inspiring this work.

Method: TG models language on two abstraction levels: tokens and sentence-level thought states. During token generation for a sentence, TG cross-attends to prior sentence representations stored in memory. It uses shared parameters for tokens/sentences and a unified next-token cross-entropy objective to optimize sentence vectors via backward gradients.

Result: Scaling experiments show TG outperforms GPT-2 in efficiency, requiring less data (~5-8%) and fewer parameters (~33-42%) for comparable loss. TG also displays improved relational generalization, reducing certain contextual errors like father-son reversal curse.

Conclusion: Modeling sentence-level thought states alongside tokens enhances efficiency, representation consistency, and contextual accuracy in language generation tasks compared to standard Transformers.

Abstract: Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level "thought" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaGReS framework enhances Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by addressing redundancy in context selection through optimized algorithms, improving answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of redundant or near-duplicate contexts in RAG systems, which waste token budgets and degrade the quality of downstream tasks like generation.

Method: The authors introduce AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware framework that uses greedy selection and a calibrated trade-off parameter to optimize context selection under token-budget constraints. This approach ensures better relevance and reduces duplication.

Result: AdaGReS demonstrates improved performances in open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and biomedical corpuses by decreasing redundancy and improving context selection quality.

Conclusion: The framework consistently enhances the context quality and robustness of RAG systems, leading to better overall system performance, while eliminating manual tuning challenges.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.

*Ankan Aich,Yangming Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved self-supervised monocular depth estimation approach tailored for robotic surgery, emphasizing precise geometric details and robust handling of challenging surgical environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular depth estimation methods fail in capturing geometries of thin structures and transparent surfaces under adverse surgical conditions.

Method: The authors adapt high-fidelity synthetic priors using DV-LORA to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world domains efficiently. They also introduce a novel evaluation protocol focusing on challenging scenarios.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% on the SCARED dataset, reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17%, showcasing improved depth estimation in high-specularity environments.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the use of synthetic priors with domain adaptation as a promising direction for improving surgical depth estimation under adverse conditions.

Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

TL;DR: The paper presents a video-based assessment pipeline for urban warfare training, specifically analyzing team and individual performances in Enter and Clear the Room drills using AI and computer vision analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable, accurate, and non-intrusive performance assessments during urban warfare training, as traditional methods rely on expensive tools or subjective assessments.

Method: Developed a computer vision system to extract relevant data from training videos, analyzed by cognitive task analyses to provide domain-specific metrics for performance scoring.

Result: Validated the video-based system with real-world Enter and Clear the Room drills, producing actionable metrics for individual and team performance, enhancing After Action Reviews.

Conclusion: Video-based analysis can support scalable, hardware-free performance evaluation in training exercises. Further improvements will integrate 3D video data and broaden applicability for urban warfare training.

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient compression of long videos while maintaining high-fidelity frame details and providing low-cost memory encoding.

Method: Develops a neural network with a pretraining objective to preserve single-frame details at any temporal position, allowing compression and perceptually accurate retrieval.

Result: The model compresses videos effectively into a context of about 5k length, with perceptually preserved frames, supporting autoregressive video models with long memory and minimal fidelity loss.

Conclusion: PFP serves as an efficient video compression and retrieval model, demonstrating feasibility for long memory context in video modeling and potential for various neural architecture optimizations.

Abstract: We present PFP, a neural network structure to compress long videos into short contexts, with an explicit pretraining objective to preserve the high-frequency details of single frames at arbitrary temporal positions. The baseline model can compress a 20-second video into a context at about 5k length, where random frames can be retrieved with perceptually preserved appearances. Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss. We evaluate the framework with ablative settings and discuss the trade-offs of possible neural architecture designs.

*Qucheng Peng,Hongfei Xue,Pu Wang,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel lifelong domain adaptation task for 3D human pose estimation (3D HPE), aimed at overcoming data constraints and catastrophic forgetting in adapting to diverse domains without past domain access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D HPE struggles with reliance on controlled environment data, which limits its generalization to diverse real-world scenarios. Current domain adaptation methods do not adequately address issues related to non-stationary pose datasets.

Method: A new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based framework integrates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator to handle domain shifts, align poses, and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The 3D pose generator adopts pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware paradigms.

Result: Extensive experiments on a variety of domain-adaptive 3D HPE datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating effective generalization and knowledge retention.

Conclusion: The proposed lifelong domain adaptive framework for 3D HPE successfully addresses challenges in generalization and catastrophic forgetting, paving the way for improved real-world applications with robust adaptation across diverse domains.

Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains.

*Krithika Iyer,Austin Tapp,Athelia Paulli,Gabrielle Dickerson,Syed Muhammad Anwar,Natasha Lepore,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study develops a deep learning framework to create synthetic CT images from pediatric MRIs, enabling cranial bone and suture analysis without ionizing radiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in pediatric cranial evaluation due to the contraindication of CT radiation in children and MRI's inability to capture cranial sutures and bone density.

Method: The proposed method uses a deep learning-driven pipeline with variational autoencoders to transform T1-weighted MRIs into synthetic CTs, achieving cranial bone segmentation and suture probability mapping.

Result: Synthetic CTs showed 99% structural similarity to real CTs, with Dice coefficients of 85% for skull segmentation and 80% for suture segmentation. Statistical equivalence was confirmed between real and synthetic CTs.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap in non-invasive pediatric cranial evaluation, offering a radiation-free alternative for cranial and suture analysis from MRI scans.

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

*Charith Wickrema,Eliza Mace,Hunter Brown,Heidys Cabrera,Nick Krall,Matthew O'Neill,Shivangi Sarkar,Lowell Weissman,Eric Hughes,Guido Zarrella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses training foundation models for remote sensing datasets using artificial intelligence techniques at unprecedented scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding regarding scaling relationships for high-resolution remote sensing datasets in artificial intelligence applications.

Method: The researchers utilized commercial satellite EO data, progressively trained larger ViT backbones, and conducted analysis using the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox.

Result: The study found that performance is constrained by data scarcity rather than model parameters, offering insight into bridging domain gaps across remote sensing modalities.

Conclusion: The findings aim to guide strategies for data collection, compute budgeting, and optimization in developing advanced models for remote sensing domains.

Abstract: We explore the scaling behaviors of artificial intelligence to establish practical techniques for training foundation models on high-resolution electro-optical (EO) datasets that exceed the current state-of-the-art scale by orders of magnitude. Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural-image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well-understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report success and failure modes observed at petascale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities. We observe that even at this scale, performance is consistent with a data limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one. These practical insights are intended to inform data-collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules that advance the future development of frontier-scale RS foundation models.

*Yipei Wang,Qianye Yang,Lior Drukker,Aris T. Papageorghiou,Yipeng Hu,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel bi-level optimization framework for automated fetal ultrasound skill assessment, eliminating the reliance on predefined skill ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ultrasound skill evaluation is subjective and time-consuming, and existing automated methods rely heavily on pre-assumed factors, limiting their generalizability.

Method: A bi-level optimization framework is developed, comprising a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimized simultaneously to evaluate skills based on task performance.

Result: The proposed framework was validated on real-world fetal head ultrasound videos, showing its feasibility in quantifying skill levels using optimized task performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of the proposed framework for objective and quantitative ultrasound skill assessment without needing predefined skill ratings.

Abstract: Traditionally, ultrasound skill assessment has relied on expert supervision and feedback, a process known for its subjectivity and time-intensive nature. Previous works on quantitative and automated skill assessment have predominantly employed supervised learning methods, often limiting the analysis to predetermined or assumed factors considered influential in determining skill levels. In this work, we propose a novel bi-level optimisation framework that assesses fetal ultrasound skills by how well a task is performed on the acquired fetal ultrasound images, without using manually predefined skill ratings. The framework consists of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimised jointly by refining the two networks simultaneously. We validate the proposed method on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of scanning the fetal head. The results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by the proposed framework, which quantifies optimised task performance as a skill indicator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the robustness of DNN-based MDE models is critical as adversarial attacks exploit their vulnerability, which impacts their reliability in practical use.

Method: The study proposes a physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization-based adversarial attack method, integrating a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, using light projection to cause input perturbations.

Result: The experiments demonstrated that the proposed method created effective adversarial examples, leading to depth misestimations where parts of objects disappeared from the target scene.

Conclusion: The vulnerabilities of DNN-based MDE models remain critical, but the proposed method offers a way to evaluate and understand the impact of adversarial attacks, enabling further development of robust mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

*Yulong Zou,Bo Liu,Cun-Jing Zheng,Yuan-ming Geng,Siyue Li,Qiankun Zuo,Shuihua Wang,Yudong Zhang,Jin Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Meta-Guided Multi-Modal Learning (MGML) framework to improve brain tumor segmentation using incomplete MRI data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete multimodal MRI data in clinical settings make it challenging to fully utilize information for brain tumor segmentation. The authors aim to maximize the use of incomplete multimodal data effectively.

Method: The MGML framework includes two components: Meta-Parameterized Adaptive Modality Fusion (Meta-AMF) for adaptive integration of modalities under varying conditions, and a consistency regularization module to enhance segmentation and robustness.

Result: The MGML method achieves superior performance on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets, with significantly high Dice scores for tumor segmentation tasks across different missing modality scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed MGML framework successfully improves segmentation performance and can be seamlessly integrated into existing pipelines without altering model architectures. It represents a robust approach for handling incomplete multimodal medical imaging data.

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel cross-view geo-localisation (CVGL) system addressing challenges in feature aggregation and alignment by fine-tuning a DINOv2 backbone, introducing a multi-scale channel reallocation module, and integrating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing for adaptive processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in tackling the significant viewpoint discrepancies that hinder effective feature aggregation and alignment in cross-view geo-localisation (CVGL).

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Leveraging the DINOv2 backbone with convolution adapter fine-tuning. 2) Introducing a multi-scale channel reallocation module. 3) Using a Mixture-of-Experts routing in the aggregation process for dynamic subspace selection.

Result: Experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets show competitive performance with fewer trained parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows promise in mitigating viewpoint disparities while reducing parameter size, indicating a significant advancement in CVGL systems.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localisation (CVGL) aims to estimate the geographic location of a query image by matching it with images from a large-scale database. However, the significant view-point discrepancies present considerable challenges for effective feature aggregation and alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CVGL system that incorporates three key improvements. Firstly, we leverage the DINOv2 backbone with a convolution adapter fine-tuning to enhance model adaptability to cross-view variations. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale channel reallocation module to strengthen the diversity and stability of spatial representations. Finally, we propose an improved aggregation module that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing into the feature aggregation process. Specifically, the module dynamically selects expert subspaces for the keys and values in a cross-attention framework, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous input domains. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with fewer trained parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an AI-driven framework to automate skill assessment in microanastomosis surgery, achieving high accuracy for action segmentation and skill grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training assessments in microanastomosis surgeries are subjective, inconsistent, and time-intensive, necessitating automated, objective, and efficient solutions.

Method: The system uses YOLO and DeepSORT for object tracking, a self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection, and supervised classification for skill assessment.

Result: The framework achieved a 92.4% accuracy in action segmentation and an 85.5% accuracy in skill evaluation, surpassing expert consistency.

Conclusion: This AI-based solution offers standardized, real-time feedback for improving surgical training and competency in microsurgery, contributing to better evaluation practices.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional methods relying on atmospheric scattering and deep learning approaches (CNNs and Transformers) struggling with long-range dependencies and computational resource demands.

Method: A U-Net-like architecture combined with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), incorporating Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block (OLIFBlock) to enhance cross-channel communication and multi-scale feature capture.

Result: Experiments show competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets with reduced model size and computational effort.

Conclusion: DehazeSNN is effective in delivering high-quality haze-free images, offering an optimal balance of performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a critical challenge in computer vision, essential for enhancing image clarity in hazy conditions. Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features. However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers demand significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose DehazeSNN, an innovative architecture that integrates a U-Net-like design with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). DehazeSNN captures multi-scale image features while efficiently managing local and long-range dependencies. The introduction of the Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block (OLIFBlock) enhances cross-channel communication, resulting in superior dehazing performance with reduced computational burden. Our extensive experiments show that DehazeSNN is highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, delivering high-quality haze-free images with a smaller model size and less multiply-accumulate operations. The proposed dehazing method is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoranLiu507/DehazeSNN.

*Changzhen Li,Yuecong Min,Jie Zhang,Zheng Yuan,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies vulnerabilities in Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models through adversarial attacks, revealing critical weaknesses in their semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the adversarial robustness of state-of-the-art Text-to-Video diffusion models and explore their vulnerabilities to small prompt modifications.

Method: Two adversarial attack methods are introduced: T2VAttack-S, which replaces semantically or temporally critical words with synonyms, and T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words into prompts.

Result: The study finds that minimal prompt changes can significantly degrade T2V models’ performance in video-text alignment and temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: T2V diffusion models are highly vulnerable to simple adversarial prompts, emphasizing the need to improve their robustness against such attacks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method to extrapolate views for autonomous driving without relying on costly sensors or annotations, using image-based point cloud estimation and a deformable 4D Gaussian framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current view extrapolation methods depend on expensive tools like LiDAR and annotations, making them impractical for real-world use. A cheaper and more adaptable solution is needed.

Method: The approach involves estimating static and dynamic point clouds solely from images, employing a deformable 4D Gaussian framework for scene reconstruction, and refining these results iteratively with a video diffusion model.

Result: Their method generates higher-quality images at extrapolated viewpoints compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed technique simplifies the requirements and improves the quality of view extrapolation for autonomous driving applications, making it more practical for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

*Gur-Eyal Sela,Kumar Krishna Agrawal,Bharathan Balaji,Joseph Gonzalez,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RedunCut improves live video analytics efficiency by optimizing dynamic model size selection, reducing compute costs by 14-62% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vision models for live video analytics have high inference costs, and existing DMSS methods fail on diverse workloads due to inefficient sampling and inaccurate accuracy prediction.

Method: RedunCut employs a measurement-driven planner for cost-benefit sampling and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to enhance accuracy predictions.

Result: RedunCut reduces computational costs significantly (14-62%) across different video types and remains robust under varying scenarios.

Conclusion: RedunCut's improvements in DMSS make it a viable solution for efficient video analytics over a range of use cases.

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.

TL;DR: The study uses a deep learning model with satellite imagery to detect surface changes more effectively, particularly for disaster management and environmental monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of detecting surface changes from satellite imagery caused by atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts, which hamper effective disaster response and environmental monitoring.

Method: A deep learning inpainting model based on the SATLAS foundation is trained to predict the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series using globally diverse data to detect changes through discrepancies between predictions and observations.

Result: The approach shows higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting anomalies, such as earthquake-triggered surface ruptures, compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The method provides a significant improvement over baseline approaches, enabling automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of U-Net and Transformer-based models in capturing long-range dependencies and handling multi-organ scenarios or low-contrast medical images while ensuring computational efficiency for clinical settings.

Method: The proposed GCA-ResUNet integrates a Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module that decouples channel-wise context modeling into groups and uses direction-aware coordinate encoding for spatial dependency representation. This retains efficiency while enhancing global representation.

Result: GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% on the Synapse dataset and 92.64% on ACDC, outperforming CNN and Transformer-based methods in accuracy, especially for small anatomical structures.

Conclusion: GCA-ResUNet demonstrates an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency for medical image segmentation. Its lightweight and scalable design makes it suitable for resource-constrained clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GASeg, a framework that enhances self-supervised semantic segmentation by addressing appearance ambiguities using geometric and topological information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome failure in self-supervised semantic segmentation caused by unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows and glare.

Method: GASeg integrates geometric and appearance-based features using a Differentiable Box-Counting module, Topological Augmentation adversarial strategy, and a multi-objective loss function (GALoss).

Result: GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in segmentation tasks across benchmarks like COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL.

Conclusion: GASeg effectively resolves appearance ambiguities by incorporating topological and geometric stability, improving semantic segmentation performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel pipeline for recovering the 3D structure of unknown spacecraft during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations using a 3D Gaussian Splatting model, tailored to adapt to dynamic space lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of recovering and rendering geometrically and photometrically accurate 3D models of target spacecraft under rapidly changing and dynamic illumination during space operations.

Method: Incorporating prior knowledge of the Sun's position into the training pipeline of 3D Gaussian Splatting to improve photometric accuracy in spaceborne dynamic lighting.

Result: The proposed solution enables 3DGS models to effectively adapt to changing illumination, capturing global shadowing and self-occlusion.

Conclusion: The method significantly enhances both the geometric and photometric quality of spacecraft models for applications like pose estimation in space operations.

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

TL;DR: The paper presents Hilbert-VLM, a novel hybrid framework combining lesion segmentation and automated disease classification for 3D medical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in processing complex 3D multimodal medical images with VLMs, such as effectively combining multimodal information and identifying critical but subtle features.

Method: A two-stage fusion framework, Hilbert-VLM, was developed. It features the HilbertMed-SAM module for lesion segmentation using redesigned SAM2 architecture and newly introduced modules like the Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention mechanism and a scale-aware decoder.

Result: The Hilbert-VLM model achieved a Dice score of 82.35% on the BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark and a diagnostic classification accuracy of 78.85%.

Conclusion: Hilbert-VLM demonstrates significant potential to enhance the accuracy of automated analysis of medical visual language models by effectively leveraging segmentation and multimodal information.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that Visual Language Models (VLMs) hold great potential for tasks such as automated medical diagnosis. However, processing complex three-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical images poses significant challenges - specifically, the effective integration of complementary information and the occasional oversight of subtle yet critical pathological features. To address these issues, we present a novel two-stage fusion framework termed Hilbert-VLM. This framework leverages the HilbertMed-SAM module for precise lesion segmentation, with the generated multimodal enhanced prompts then guiding the VLM toward accurate disease classification. Our key innovation lies in the systematic redesign of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) architecture: we incorporate Hilbert space-filling curves into the scanning mechanism of the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) to maximize the preservation of spatial locality in 3D data, a property critical for medical image analysis. We also introduce a novel Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention (HMCA) mechanism and a scale-aware decoder to capture fine-grained details. Meanwhile, the prompt enhancement module unifies segmentation masks and their corresponding textual attributes into an information-dense prompt to support VLM inference. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the Hilbert-VLM model. On the BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark, it achieves a Dice score of 82.35 percent, with a diagnostic classification accuracy (ACC) of 78.85 percent. These results demonstrate that the proposed model offers substantial potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of medical VLM-based analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC) framework to enhance flow-based diffusion editing by correcting latent trajectory errors and enabling stable and semantic transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based diffusion editing suffers from accumulated velocity errors, impacting semantic consistency and structural fidelity.

Method: The paper proposes CVC, which reformulates editing as a distribution transformation problem using a dual-perspective velocity mechanism and posterior-consistent updates to correct errors and maintain trajectory fidelity.

Result: CVC achieves stable and interpretable latent dynamics with superior fidelity, semantic alignment, and reliable editing across tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a principled approach to address latent trajectory drift, ensuring high-quality semantic editing and structural preservation.

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FitControler, a plug-in for virtual try-on models to control garment fit and introduces a fit-aware dataset, Fit4Men.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research on virtual try-on models focuses on rendering garment details but overlooks garment fit, a vital factor in determining holistic style and design.

Method: The authors developed FitControler, consisting of a fit-aware layout generator to define different fits and a multi-scale fit injector for accurate layout-driven garment rendering. They also created the Fit4Men dataset for fit-aware training.

Result: FitControler achieves precise control of garment fit when integrated with various VTON models, validated through experiments and new fit consistency metrics.

Conclusion: FitControler significantly enhances virtual try-on models by allowing customized fit control, contributing to a more realistic and style-coordinated virtual try-on experience. Code and dataset will be made available for future research.

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

*Huanxiong Liang,Yunuo Chen,Yicheng Pan,Sixian Wang,Jincheng Dai,Guo Lu,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper enhances 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) image representation through a structure-guided approach, improving RD efficiency while maintaining high-speed decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing 2DGS pipelines in RD efficiency at low bitrates due to their oblivious allocation of representation capacity and parameter precision to image structure.

Method: The approach includes structure-guided initialization for distributing 2D Gaussians based on image structural priors, adaptive bitwidth quantization to optimize parameters for complex regions, and geometry-consistent regularization aligning Gaussian orientations to gradients.

Result: Experiments show decreased BD-rate (up to 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K) while retaining over 1000 FPS decoding.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances RD performance and representational power of 2DGS without compromising decoding speed, addressing existing structural allocation shortcomings.

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MF-RSVLM, a vision-language model optimized for remote sensing tasks, addressing issues with fine-grained feature extraction and visual forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in adapting vision-language models to the remote sensing domain, where visual features differ significantly from natural images.

Method: MF-RSVLM employs multi-scale visual representations, global-local feature fusion, and recurrent visual feature injection to enhance remote sensing image understanding.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in remote sensing tasks like classification, image captioning, and VQA on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: MF-RSVLM demonstrates effective fine-grained feature extraction and visual grounding, addressing key issues in remote sensing vision-language modeling.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

### [123] [RSAgent: Learning to Reason and Act for Text-Guided Segmentation via Multi-Turn Tool Invocations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24023)
*Xingqi He,Yujie Zhang,Shuyong Gao,Wenjie Li,Lingyi Hong,Mingxi Chen,Kaixun Jiang,Jiyuan Fu,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSAgent is a multimodal large language model that performs iterative text-guided object segmentation by combining reasoning with multi-turn tool usage. It outperforms prior methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of single-pass text-guided segmentation methods, which lack the ability to revise or refine incorrect initial segmentations.

Method: RSAgent employs a multimodal large language model that performs iterative steps of querying a segmentation toolbox, analyzing visual feedback, and refining its output based on historical observations. It is trained using supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with customized task-specific rewards.

Result: RSAgent achieves superior zero-shot performance in text-guided segmentation tasks, outperforming previous methods by 9% on the ReasonSeg dataset and achieving state-of-the-art results on RefCOCOg benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach of multi-turn reasoning and iterative refinement allows RSAgent to achieve enhanced performance in object segmentation tasks, offering a more robust alternative to traditional single-pass methods.

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PipeFlow proposes a scalable video editing method, significantly reducing computational cost for long videos using motion analysis, pipelined task scheduling, and interpolation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the high computational cost and inefficiencies of long-form video editing, particularly when applying DDIM inversion and joint editing techniques to extended sequences.

Method: PipeFlow employs motion analysis to skip editing low-motion frames, introduces pipelined task scheduling for segment-wise parallel processing, and uses neural network-based interpolation for smooth transitions between video segments.

Result: PipeFlow demonstrates a speedup of up to 9.6X compared to TokenFlow and 31.7X over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT) while scaling efficiently to longer videos.

Conclusion: This method enables efficient editing of infinitely long videos without compromising computational efficiency, offering significant improvement over existing video editing techniques.

Abstract: Long-form video editing poses unique challenges due to the exponential increase in the computational cost from joint editing and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion across extended sequences. To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods. PipeFlow achieves up to a 9.6X speedup compared to TokenFlow and a 31.7X speedup over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT).

*Xinran Qin,Yuhui Quan,Ruotao Xu,Hui Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework for image denoising using reinforcement learning, outperforming traditional diffusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anisotropic diffusion methods struggle to adapt to complex image structures and are outperformed by learning-based approaches, highlighting a need for more adaptive solutions.

Method: The paper employs reinforcement learning, specifically deep Q-learning, to design a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process for image denoising. Diffusion actions are modeled and iteratively learned to adapt to varying image structures.

Result: The proposed framework effectively removes three common types of noise, outperforms traditional diffusion-based methods, and competes with advanced CNN-based methods in experiments.

Conclusion: Trainable anisotropic diffusion via reinforcement learning offers a promising alternative for high-quality image denoising, showcasing adaptability to complex image features.

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust cross-modal learning framework, NIRNL, to handle noisy annotations in cross-modal retrieval tasks, enhancing discrimination and optimizing data utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of maintaining retrieval performance in Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) despite noisy data annotations, which degrade model effectiveness.

Method: The proposed NIRNL framework includes two key components: Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) for adjusting pair discrimination and Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to classify data subsets for tailored optimization strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art robustness, particularly under high noise rates.

Conclusion: NIRNL effectively addresses noisy label issues in CMR by maximizing data utility and delivering reliable performance under challenging conditions.

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the PCRNet, which incorporates pathology context and expert experience priors using new modules to improve ocular disease recognition and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often neglect clinical pathology context and expert experience priors, which are essential for enhancing the recognition performance and decision-making interpretability in ocular disease diagnosis.

Method: The authors propose the Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) for leveraging pathology context and the Expert Prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) for emphasizing key pixel-wise regions based on expert knowledge. They integrate these modules into PCRNet and utilize an Integrated Loss function to account for sample-wise loss and label frequencies.

Result: PCRNet with IL outperforms state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods in ocular disease recognition across three datasets. Visualization analysis validates the effects of PRM and EPGA on deep neural network decision processes.

Conclusion: The proposed PCRNet effectively improves the performance and interpretability of ocular disease recognition by incorporating pathology context and expert priors into DNNs, along with a tailored loss function.

Abstract: Pathology context and expert experience play significant roles in clinical ocular disease diagnosis. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have good ocular disease recognition results, they often ignore exploring the clinical pathology context and expert experience priors to improve ocular disease recognition performance and decision-making interpretability. To this end, we first develop a novel Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage the potential of pathology context prior via the combination of the well-designed pixel-wise context compression operator and pathology distribution concentration operator; then this paper applies a novel expert prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to further highlight significant pixel-wise representation regions by fully mining the expert experience prior. By incorporating PRM and EPGA into the modern DNN, the PCRNet is constructed for automated ocular disease recognition. Additionally, we introduce an Integrated Loss (IL) to boost the ocular disease recognition performance of PCRNet by considering the effects of sample-wise loss distributions and training label frequencies. The extensive experiments on three ocular disease datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCRNet with IL over state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods. Further visualization analysis explains the inherent behavior of PRM and EPGA that affects the decision-making process of DNNs.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving fine-grained object detection in remote sensing datasets with hierarchical labels using a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss and a decoupled learning strategy in the DETR framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in embedding hierarchical semantic relationships into representation learning for fine-grained detection, specifically tackling imbalanced data distributions and interactions between classification and localization.

Method: Introduced a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss with learnable class prototypes to address class imbalance, combined with a decoupled learning strategy in DETR to separate classification and localization tasks.

Result: Experiments on three fine-grained datasets show that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively integrates hierarchical semantics and tackles key issues in fine-grained object detection, enhancing performance on datasets with hierarchical annotations.

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models used for video/image generation face high computational costs and lack hardware versatility, creating a need for a more efficient and general mechanism.

Method: RainFusion2.0 employs block-wise token representation, spatiotemporal token permutation, and a first-frame sink mechanism for efficient sparse attention, suitable for multiple hardware platforms.

Result: RainFusion2.0 achieves 80% attention sparsity, speeds up workflows by 1.5-1.8x, and maintains high-quality video outputs, validated across different generative models and hardware.

Conclusion: RainFusion2.0 makes Diffusion Transformer applications more computationally efficient and hardware-adaptive, broadening its real-world usability without compromising output quality.

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

TL;DR: The paper presents D$^2$VLM, a framework for improving video-language understanding with a focus on decoupling temporal grounding and textual response tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-language models struggle with temporal grounding and lack a logically structured approach to integrate grounding and response generation.

Method: Proposes a decoupled learning framework (D$^2$VLM) emphasizing a 'grounding then answering' paradigm and introduces a factorized preference optimization algorithm.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance on various tasks, supported by experiments and a newly constructed dataset.

Conclusion: D$^2$VLM improves event-level video-language understanding by addressing shortcomings in temporal grounding and optimizing textual response generation.

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

### [131] [Think Before You Move: Latent Motion Reasoning for Text-to-Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24100)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation by proposing a two-stage approach called Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR), which improves semantic alignment and physical plausibility by separating coarse motion planning and fine motion execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Motion generation faces a fundamental bottleneck called Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch, making it hard to map discrete linguistic intent to high-frequency motion data directly.

Method: This research introduces a Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) framework with a Dual-Granularity Tokenizer. This separates motion into a semantic Reasoning Latent for planning and an Execution Latent for physical precision, enabling autoregressive reasoning before instantiating motion.

Result: The approach demonstrates non-trivial improvements in semantic alignment and physical plausibility when implemented on T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous) models.

Conclusion: LMR bridges the gap between language and motion by leveraging a motion-aligned latent space for coarse-to-fine reasoning, offering a scalable solution for more nuanced motion generation.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

### [132] [Guided Diffusion-based Generation of Adversarial Objects for Real-World Monocular Depth Estimation Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24111)
*Yongtao Chen,Yanbo Wang,Wentao Zhao,Guole Shen,Tianchen Deng,Jingchuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new adversarial attack method targeting Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) in autonomous driving, using a training-free generative framework to produce realistic adversarial objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving depends on MDE for safety, yet existing MDE systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Current physical attacks struggle with realism and placement challenges, which limits their effectiveness in complex driving scenarios.

Method: This study introduces a training-free adversarial attack framework based on conditional diffusion. It includes a Salient Region Selection module to identify important scene regions and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance for better adversarial gradient utilization.

Result: The proposed method generates realistic adversarial objects that trigger significant depth estimation shifts. Experimental evaluations, both digital and physical, demonstrate its superiority in stealthiness, effectiveness, and physical application over existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework represents an advanced approach for assessing vulnerabilities in autonomous driving systems, with better effectiveness and realism, and emphasizes the importance of addressing such adversarial risks for traffic safety.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

*Yuan Feng,Yue Yang,Xiaohan He,Jiatong Zhao,Jianlong Chen,Zijun Chen,Daocheng Fu,Qi Liu,Renqiu Xia,Bo Zhang,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoBench is introduced to evaluate geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) through hierarchical tasks while addressing limitations in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating geometric reasoning in VLMs face contamination risks, lack reasoning process focus, and insufficient granularity.

Method: GeoBench offers hierarchical reasoning benchmarks across four levels, using formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen to assess capabilities like reasoning and error correction.

Result: GeoBench experiments show reasoning models outperform general MLLMs but struggle with complex tasks. Sub-goal decomposition and premise filtering impact accuracy, while Chain-of-Thought prompting sometimes degrades performance.

Conclusion: GeoBench is a comprehensive tool for assessing geometric reasoning in VLMs and guides improved methodology for geometric problem-solving systems.

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

### [134] [Enhancing LLM-Based Neural Network Generation: Few-Shot Prompting and Efficient Validation for Automated Architecture Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24120)
*Chandini Vysyaraju,Raghuvir Duvvuri,Avi Goyal,Dmitry Ignatov,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the systematic application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating neural network architectures in computer vision, presenting methodologies for optimized prompt engineering and efficient validation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated neural network architecture design poses challenges in task variation, resource constraints, and the need for effective search methods. This research aims to leverage LLMs for architecture generation in computer vision, enhancing accessibility while reducing computational demands.

Method: The study introduces Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP) to systematically analyze the impact of using different numbers of examples (n = 1 to 6) for architecture generation with LLMs. Additionally, it proposes Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation to quickly deduplicate architectures, offering a lightweight alternative to AST parsing. Large-scale experiments were conducted across seven computer vision benchmarks to validate the approaches.

Result: The study established that n = 3 examples in FSAP optimally balance diversity and task focus. The Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation method achieved a significant 100x speed improvement over traditional AST parsing. Overall, 1,900 unique architectures were generated through experiments.

Conclusion: The contributions of this work enhance the feasibility and efficiency of LLM-based neural architecture design in computer vision. The proposed strategies provide actionable guidelines and accessible evaluation methodologies, broadening opportunities for researchers to explore and implement new architectures with limited resources.

Abstract: Automated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.

### [135] [Taming Preference Mode Collapse via Directional Decoupling Alignment in Diffusion Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24146)
*Chubin Chen,Sujie Hu,Jiashu Zhu,Meiqi Wu,Jintao Chen,Yanxun Li,Nisha Huang,Chengyu Fang,Jiahong Wu,Xiangxiang Chu,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses Preference Mode Collapse (PMC) in text-to-image diffusion models during alignment with human preferences, proposing a new benchmark DivGenBench and method D$^2$-Align to preserve generative diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the alignment of text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences while addressing the issue of generative diversity collapse caused by existing reinforcement learning methods.

Method: The authors introduce the D$^2$-Align framework, which calculates a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space to adjust the reward signal during optimization, maintaining diversity in generative outputs.

Result: The proposed method, D$^2$-Align, is tested via qualitative and quantitative metrics and demonstrates superior performance in maintaining diversity and aligning with human preferences.

Conclusion: D$^2$-Align effectively mitigates Preference Mode Collapse and achieves better alignment with human preferences, providing an improved balance between quality and diversity in generative models.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

TL;DR: IMDD-1M introduces a massive industrial multimodal dataset with 1M image-text pairs, enabling advancements in manufacturing defect analysis and multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust multimodal dataset and foundation model for manufacturing defect analysis, improving scalability, adaptability, and efficiency in industrial scenarios.

Method: Developed IMDD-1M dataset with aligned image-text pairs; trained a diffusion-based vision-language foundation model for industrial applications.

Result: Foundation model achieves comparable performance to expert models using less than 5% of domain-specific data, proving its data efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: IMDD-1M and the trained foundation model enable scalable, domain-specific adaptations for industrial defect analysis and manufacturing intelligence.

Abstract: We present IMDD-1M, the first large-scale Industrial Multimodal Defect Dataset comprising 1,000,000 aligned image-text pairs, designed to advance multimodal learning for manufacturing and quality inspection. IMDD-1M contains high-resolution real-world defects spanning over 60 material categories and more than 400 defect types, each accompanied by expert-verified annotations and fine-grained textual descriptions detailing defect location, severity, and contextual attributes. This dataset enables a wide spectrum of applications, including classification, segmentation, retrieval, captioning, and generative modeling. Building upon IMDD-1M, we train a diffusion-based vision-language foundation model from scratch, specifically tailored for industrial scenarios. The model serves as a generalizable foundation that can be efficiently adapted to specialized domains through lightweight fine-tuning. With less than 5% of the task-specific data required by dedicated expert models, it achieves comparable performance, highlighting the potential of data-efficient foundation model adaptation for industrial inspection and generation, paving the way for scalable, domain-adaptive, and knowledge-grounded manufacturing intelligence.

### [137] [Bayesian Self-Distillation for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24162)
*Anton Adelöw,Matteo Gamba,Atsuto Maki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a method for improving classification models without relying on fixed hard targets, which enhances accuracy, calibration, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving supervised deep neural networks by overcoming the overconfidence and limited robustness caused by hard targets in training.

Method: BSD uses Bayesian inference on the model's predictions to create sample-specific and adaptive target distributions, instead of relying on hard targets after initialization.

Result: BSD outperforms other self-distillation methods in test accuracy (e.g., +1.4% on CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50), reduces calibration error (-40% Expected Calibration Error for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100), and enhances robustness against data noise, corruptions, and perturbations.

Conclusion: BSD is a novel, architecture-preserving method that consistently improves model performance, robustness, and calibration for various architectures and datasets, and sets new standards for robustness under noisy labels.

Abstract: Supervised training of deep neural networks for classification typically relies on hard targets, which promote overconfidence and can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets, reducing their effectiveness. With this in mind, we propose Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a principled method for constructing sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions. Unlike existing approaches, BSD does not rely on hard targets after initialization. BSD consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g. +1.4% for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing architecture-preserving self-distillation methods for a range of deep architectures and datasets. Additional benefits include improved robustness against data corruptions, perturbations, and label noise. When combined with a contrastive loss, BSD achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise for single-stage, single-network methods.

*Zefeng He,Xiaoye Qu,Yafu Li,Tong Zhu,Siyuan Huang,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffThinker, a diffusion-based paradigm for multimodal reasoning, focusing on improving vision-centric tasks. It demonstrates significant performance improvements over other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning approaches are dominated by text-centric methods, which struggle with complex vision-centric tasks. The paper proposes a generative image-to-image framework to address these limitations.

Method: The DiffThinker framework transforms multimodal reasoning into generative image-to-image tasks using diffusion techniques, delivering improved logical consistency and spatial precision.

Result: DiffThinker outperforms state-of-the-art models like GPT-5, Gemini-3-Flash, and Qwen3-VL-32B across tasks such as sequential planning, optimization, and spatial configuration.

Conclusion: Generative multimodal reasoning using DiffThinker is highly effective for vision-centric tasks and establishes a new paradigm with properties like efficiency, controllability, and parallelism.

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attained significant strides in multimodal reasoning, their reasoning processes remain predominantly text-centric, leading to suboptimal performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel Generative Multimodal Reasoning paradigm and introduce DiffThinker, a diffusion-based reasoning framework. Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.

### [139] [Deep Global Clustering for Hyperspectral Image Segmentation: Concepts, Applications, and Open Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24172)
*Yu-Tang Chang,Pin-Wei Chen,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a memory-efficient framework for HSI segmentation that operates on local patches without pre-training, achieving promising results but facing optimization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational bottlenecks of hyperspectral imaging analysis in applications like close-range agricultural monitoring.

Method: The proposed method, Deep Global Clustering (DGC), segments HSI by learning global clustering structure using overlapping local patch observations, avoiding pre-training and maintaining constant memory usage.

Result: DGC achieves high accuracy in separating background and tissue on a leaf disease dataset (mean IoU 0.925) and enables unsupervised disease detection. However, it encounters optimization instability due to clustering over-merging.

Conclusion: The DGC framework presents a novel approach to HSI segmentation with impressive results, but it requires refinement in dynamic loss balancing to become practical for stable implementations.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniAct, a framework that improves humanoid robots' ability to follow multimodal instructions with low latency and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of enabling humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions efficiently by bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution.

Method: The authors propose UniAct, a two-stage framework utilizing a fine-tuned Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and causal streaming pipeline. By unifying inputs through a shared codebook with FSQ, it aligns cross-modal tasks and ensures physically grounded action execution.

Result: UniAct achieved a 19% improvement in zero-shot tracking success rates for imperfect reference motions and demonstrated robust generalization in a diverse 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark (UniMoCap).

Conclusion: UniAct provides a significant advancement toward developing general-purpose humanoid assistants that can interact seamlessly through unified perception and control.

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

### [141] [Guiding a Diffusion Transformer with the Internal Dynamics of Itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24176)
*Xingyu Zhou,Qifan Li,Xiaobin Hu,Hai Chen,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Internal Guidance (IG), an approach to improve generative diffusion models by incorporating auxiliary supervision at training and extrapolation during sampling, achieving state-of-the-art image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with generating high-quality samples in low-probability areas of the data distribution. Existing guidance methods face issues of oversimplification, distortion, or increased complexity requiring extra training or sampling steps.

Method: The paper proposes the Internal Guidance (IG) strategy, which applies auxiliary supervision on intermediate layers during training and extrapolates outputs from these layers during the sampling process to improve efficiency and quality.

Result: The approach significantly enhances training efficiency and generation quality. On ImageNet 256x256, it achieves FID values of 5.31 at 80 epochs and 1.34 at 800 epochs using LightningDiT-XL/1+IG, a new state-of-the-art result when combined with classifier free guidance (CFG).

Conclusion: Internal Guidance (IG) improves both the efficiency and the quality of diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art results and addressing limitations of previous methods with a simpler, more effective strategy.

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

*Pieter M. Blok,Haozhou Wang,Hyun Kwon Suh,Peicheng Wang,James Burridge,Wei Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointRAFT introduces a high-throughput point cloud regression network for estimating potato weight from partial point clouds, achieving high accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimizing errors in potato weight estimation due to incomplete point clouds on harvesters, which impacts agricultural efficiency.

Method: PointRAFT directly predicts tuber weight from raw partial 3D point clouds using a novel object height embedding, avoiding full geometry reconstruction.

Result: PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and inference of up to 150 tubers per second, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: PointRAFT is a significant advancement in high-speed and accurate tuber weight prediction, with broad applications in robotics and phenotyping.

Abstract: Potato yield is a key indicator for optimizing cultivation practices in agriculture. Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks. The code, network weights, and a subset of the dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/pieterblok/pointraft.git.

Motivation: The rapid rise of autonomous systems demands effective integration of multi-modal sensor data for robust Spatial Intelligence, addressing challenges where foundation models in single-modal contexts fail.

Method: A comprehensive framework is presented, including a taxonomy for pre-training paradigms, evaluations of sensor characteristics, and exploration of textual inputs and occupancy representations for improved perception and planning.

Result: Key bottlenecks were identified, like computational efficiency and scalability, while advancements were made towards creating holistic representations for tasks such as 3D object detection and open-world planning.

Conclusion: It outlines a roadmap for developing general-purpose multi-modal foundation models to enable effective Spatial Intelligence in real-world autonomous systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data. While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CorGi and CorGi+, methods to speed up the inference of diffusion transformer (DiT) models by reducing redundant computations, achieving up to 2.0x speedup without compromising generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT models exhibit high inference costs due to their iterative denoising process combined with large capacities, and redundant computations across steps add to the inefficiency.

Method: Proposes CorGi, a training-free framework, to accelerate DiT inference by caching low-contribution transformer block outputs and reusing them, along with CorGi+, which uses per-block cross-attention maps for text-to-image tasks to improve speed and quality.

Result: CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on DiT models while maintaining high-quality visual generations.

Conclusion: The methods successfully reduce inference costs and redundant computations in DiT models, offering significant speedups and maintaining generation quality for visual and text-to-image tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a progressive generative adversarial network combined with optimization techniques to tackle imbalanced medical image classification, achieving high accuracy in COVID-19 chest X-ray classifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image classification faces challenges due to imbalance in datasets, especially during pandemics like COVID-19, limiting effective AI/ML diagnostic methods.

Method: A generative adversarial network generates synthetic data to balance datasets, combined with a weighted approach and meta-heuristic optimization for classifier hyper-parameter tuning.

Result: The model demonstrated accuracy of 95.5% (4-class) and 98.5% (2-class) in chest X-ray COVID-19 classification, showing improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses imbalanced data in medical image classification by combining synthetic data generation and optimization, proving useful during pandemics.

Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced data is prominent in medical image classification. This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Attention Refinement Module (ARM) to improve Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) by refining CLIP's internal features. ARM shows efficient performance boosts without significant computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of CLIP's coarse, image-level representations in OVSS, which lack detailed pixel-level precision. Current methods using external models or static heuristics are either expensive or ineffective.

Method: The proposed Attention Refinement Module (ARM) is a lightweight, learnable module that adaptively refines and fuses hierarchical features from CLIP. It uses semantically-guided cross-attention and self-attention blocks, enabling it to serve as a universal post-processor.

Result: ARM enhances baseline OVSS performance across multiple benchmarks with minimal inference overhead. It functions effectively as a 'train once, use anywhere' solution.

Conclusion: ARM establishes a new, efficient paradigm for training-free OVSS by unlocking the potential of CLIP's internal features, achieving better segmentation without relying on expensive external models or static approaches.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

### [147] [Mirage: One-Step Video Diffusion for Photorealistic and Coherent Asset Editing in Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24227)
*Shuyun Wang,Haiyang Sun,Bing Wang,Hangjun Ye,Xin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Mirage," a video diffusion model for editing driving scene videos in a photorealistic and temporally coherent manner, addressing challenges in visual fidelity and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems require diverse and scalable high-quality training data. Existing video object editing approaches face difficulties in balancing visual fidelity and temporal coherence.

Method: Mirage utilizes a text-to-video diffusion-based prior to ensure temporal consistency. To address degradation and misalignment issues, temporally agnostic latents from a 2D encoder are integrated into the 3D decoder and a two-stage alignment strategy is employed.

Result: Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency in diverse driving scene editing scenarios, providing improved alignment and cleaner supervision.

Conclusion: Mirage offers a robust framework for video editing in autonomous driving, and can also generalize to other video-to-video tasks, serving as a baseline for future research.

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

### [148] [CropTrack: A Tracking with Re-Identification Framework for Precision Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24838)
*Md Ahmed Al Muzaddid,Jordan A. James,William J. Beksi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CropTrack is a novel MOT framework designed for challenging agricultural environments. It combines motion and appearance information to address issues like repetitive patterns, occlusions, and similar object appearances. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural environments pose challenges for MOT due to frequent occlusions, repetitive patterns, similar appearances, and illumination changes. Motion-based methods struggle under these conditions, necessitating a combined approach with appearance-based strategies.

Method: CropTrack incorporates reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with conflict resolution, and a prototype feature bank using exponential moving averages to improve appearance-based tracking.

Result: CropTrack significantly improves identity preservation, achieving higher identification F1 and association accuracy scores with fewer identity switches compared to existing methods on agricultural datasets.

Conclusion: CropTrack offers a robust solution for MOT in agricultural settings by effectively combining motion and appearance information, setting a new standard in tracking performance.

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model built on the Sapiens foundational model, achieving robust performance across datasets without requiring cross-domain training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FER models lack generalization when deployed on diverse, real-world data, hindering their application and progress in the field.

Method: The authors utilize Sapiens, a human vision foundational model trained via a Masked Autoencoder, and define MotivNet as an additional downstream task. They evaluate MotivNet's viability based on benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity.

Result: MotivNet achieves competitive performance across datasets without the need for cross-domain training, validating its utility as a downstream task of the Sapiens model.

Conclusion: MotivNet enhances facial emotion recognition with robust generalization and practicality, positioning it as a valuable tool for real-world applications. This advancement could further incentivize research and development in FER domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model for robust real-world application. Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

*Xunyi Zhao,Gengze Zhou,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), proposing an evaluation framework, VLN-MME, and identifying weaknesses such as poor context awareness and spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the capabilities of MLLMs as embodied agents in complex tasks requiring spatial reasoning and sequential decisions.

Method: A modular evaluation framework (VLN-MME) is developed for systematic testing of MLLMs in embodied navigation tasks, including experiments on zero-shot agents.

Result: Enhancing agents with Chain-of-Thought reasoning and self-reflection reduced performance, indicating limitations in spatial reasoning and context awareness of MLLMs.

Conclusion: MLLMs struggle with sequential decision-making and 3D spatial reasoning in navigation tasks; VLN-MME provides a basis for further development in these areas.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

*Fuqiang Gu,Yuanke Li,Xianlei Long,Kangping Ji,Chao Chen,Qingyi Gu,Zhenliang Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MambaSeg, a semantic segmentation framework integrating RGB and event data to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in multimodal scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based methods struggle in challenging visual conditions, and event cameras lack sufficient visual detail; combining these modalities can leverage their complementary strengths.

Method: MambaSeg employs dual-branch Mamba encoders for RGB and event streams with a Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM) that enables fine-grained fusion through spatial and temporal dimensions.

Result: MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance on DDD17 and DSEC datasets with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: MambaSeg effectively leverages multimodal RGB and event data, offering scalable and robust solutions for semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

*Zhi Li,Yaqi Wang,Bingtao Ma,Yifan Zhang,Huiyu Zhou,Shuai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the PGMP framework to address metal artifacts in Dental CBCT with a novel deterministic restoration method that outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAR methods in Dental CBCT are limited by issues like spectral blurring and hallucinated structures, hindering clinical diagnosis.

Method: The paper introduces the PGMP framework involving anatomically based physics simulation, a deterministic manifold projection technique for restoration, and a semantic-structural alignment module.

Result: PGMP surpasses state-of-the-art MAR methods in terms of efficiency and diagnostic accuracy as demonstrated on synthetic and clinical datasets.

Conclusion: PGMP offers a robust solution for MAR, combining accurate artifact reduction and real-world clinical applicability, enhancing diagnostic precision.

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

*Yohan Park,Hyunwoo Ha,Wonjun Jo,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DarkEQA, a benchmark designed to test Vision Language Models (VLMs) under low-light conditions, enabling robustness evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are central to embodied agents, yet current benchmarks fail to evaluate their performance in low-light conditions despite the need for 24/7 operation in varying visual environments.

Method: DarkEQA uses controlled low-light visual degradations applied in RAW space with a physics-based illumination model and an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline for evaluating VLMs.

Result: The study reveals significant limitations of state-of-the-art VLMs when exposed to low-light conditions, emphasizing the need for robustness improvements.

Conclusion: DarkEQA provides a valuable tool for analyzing and improving VLM robustness under challenging visual conditions, addressing an overlooked but critical gap.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

*Zhe Huang,Hao Wen,Aiming Hao,Bingze Song,Meiqi Wu,Jiahong Wu,Xiangxiang Chu,Sheng Lu,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DualityForge, a framework addressing the issue of visual ungrounded hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for counterfactual video understanding, using a novel dataset (DualityVidQA) and training regime (DNA-Train) to improve performance and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with over-reliance on language priors and produce hallucinations when analyzing counterfactual videos. Addressing this issue is difficult due to the scarcity of annotated counterfactual data.

Method: The authors propose DualityForge, a framework using diffusion-based video editing to synthesize counterfactual video scenarios and structured QA generation processes. They also introduce DNA-Train, a two-stage training protocol leveraging contrastive data with advantage normalization for stable policy optimization.

Result: DualityForge and DNA-Train achieve a 24.0% reduction in hallucinations on counterfactual video tasks compared to a strong baseline (Qwen2.5-VL-7B) and demonstrate improvements across other benchmarks, highlighting generalization.

Conclusion: The framework and training approach effectively mitigate hallucinations in MLLMs, demonstrating strong performance and generalizability. The dataset and code will be open-sourced to support further research and development.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpaceTimePilot is a video diffusion model that can independently modify camera viewpoints and motion sequences in monocular videos, enabling flexible generative rendering across space and time. The method achieves robust space-time disentanglement with novel training techniques and data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to address the challenge of disentangling spatial and temporal information in video generation, enabling independent control of camera viewpoints and motion sequences for creative and practical video rendering tasks.

Method: The authors introduce an animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process for explicit motion control, a temporal-warping training scheme using existing multi-view datasets, and a synthetic dataset called CamxTime to provide full space-time coverage. The model is trained jointly with these innovations for enhanced precision.

Result: The experiments, conducted on both real-world and synthetic data, show SpaceTimePilot achieves strong spatial and temporal disentanglement with better performance compared to existing methods for controllable video generation.

Conclusion: SpaceTimePilot establishes a new standard for controllable generative video rendering by effectively disentangling space and time dimensions, thanks to innovative mechanisms and datasets introduced in this work.

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

*Yuan Jia,Ruimin Wu,Rui Song,Jiaojiao Li,Bin Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a 3D panoramic stitching framework tackling distortions and artifacts in traditional 2D methods, resulting in natural and consistent outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image stitching methods often fail in real 3D scenes with multiple depth layers and occlusions, leading to significant distortions and ghosting artifacts.

Method: The framework lifts 2D images into dense 3D point representations, performs global fusion using confidence metrics, utilizes 3D-based equidistant cylindrical projection, and fills in unknown regions caused by viewpoint shifts.

Result: The method effectively reduces geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts, achieving geometrically consistent panoramic layouts, especially in complex scenarios with parallax and occlusions.

Conclusion: This new stitching paradigm transitions from 2D warping to 3D consistency, offering enhanced flexibility and producing superior panoramic outcomes for challenging environments.

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

TL;DR: This study introduces 'EndoRare,' a generative AI framework to synthesize rare gastrointestinal lesion images from a single reference image, enhancing training for AI models and novice clinicians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of sufficient data for training AI models and clinicians to recognize rare gastrointestinal lesions in endoscopy.

Method: EndoRare synthesizes high-quality lesion images using language-guided concept disentanglement to separate diagnostic lesion features from non-critical ones, ensuring diverse outputs.

Result: Validation showed EndoRare-generated images improved AI classifier performance (higher true positive rates) and boosted recall and precision for novice endoscopists in identifying rare lesions.

Conclusion: EndoRare demonstrates a data-efficient method to enhance rare disease recognition for both AI diagnostics and medical education.

Abstract: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, restricting the data available for developing reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and training novice clinicians. Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.

*Md. Enamul Hoq,Linda Larson-Prior,Fred Prior*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Virtual-Eyes, a 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline for low-dose CT lung cancer screening, showing it improves performance in generalist foundation models but disrupts specialist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preprocessing in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT lung cancer screening often lacks robustness measurement, motivating the development of a quantitative quality-control pipeline.

Method: The Virtual-Eyes pipeline enforces strict resolution, series rejection, lung block extraction, and Hounsfield-unit filtering while computing slice-level embeddings via RAD-DINO and Merlin for comparison. Performance is evaluated against different models.

Result: Virtual-Eyes improves the performance of RAD-DINO models, increasing AUCs and calibration scores, but disrupts specialist Sybil and ResNet-18 models, and shows limited transferability for Merlin.

Conclusion: Anatomically targeted quality-control pipelines stabilize and improve workflows for generalist foundation models but might negatively impact specialist models relying on raw clinical data.

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

### [159] [Robust Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation via Dual-Modal Causal Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24323)
*Haijing Liu,Zhiyuan Song,Hefeng Wu,Tao Pu,Keze Wang,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CERES, a causal framework to improve Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) by mitigating dataset biases and visual confounding factors, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation is important to understanding first-person human activity but faces challenges due to dataset biases and visual distortions intrinsic to egocentric videos.

Method: The paper proposes CERES, a causal intervention framework that includes backdoor adjustment to address language biases and front-door adjustment to counter visual confounding, combining semantic visual features with depth information.

Result: CERES significantly outperforms existing methods on standard Ego-RVOS benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in tackling dataset and visual distortions.

Conclusion: Causal approaches, as implemented in CERES, can make egocentric video object segmentation models more reliable and robust, enhancing understanding of egocentric visual content.

Abstract: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SenseNova-MARS, a framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that enables dynamic visual reasoning and efficient tool usage via reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art results in knowledge-intensive visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with human-like abilities to combine continuous reasoning with dynamic tool use in complex scenarios involving tools like search and image cropping.

Method: SenseNova-MARS utilizes reinforcement learning, specifically the BN-GSPO algorithm, to integrate tools such as image search, text search, and cropping. It also introduces the HR-MMSearch benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show SenseNova-MARS achieves top-tier results on search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks, outperforming proprietary models like Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5.

Conclusion: SenseNova-MARS advances agentic VLMs by enhancing their reasoning and tool-use capabilities, paving the way for future research. The authors commit to releasing their code, models, and datasets.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.

*Weijie Wei,Zhipeng Luo,Ling Feng,Venice Erin Liong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a framework that combines LiDAR with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for improved 3D spatial understanding and decision-making in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of Vision-Language Models that rely on 2D image data, which leads to inaccurate metric spatial reasoning and unreliable autonomous driving policies.

Method: The proposed method (LVLDrive) integrates LiDAR data into existing Vision-Language Models using a Gradual Fusion Q-Former to ensure stable fusion of LiDAR features. Additionally, a spatial-aware question-answering dataset is developed to teach advanced 3D perception and reasoning.

Result: LVLDrive outperforms vision-only models in benchmarks, demonstrating superior scene understanding, spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making.

Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of incorporating explicit 3D metric data into Vision-Language Models to enhance their trustworthiness and performance in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

*Liam Frija-Altrac,Matthew Toews*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces elementary information mechanics, a novel framework for analyzing convolutional filtering in CNNs based on principles from special relativity and quantum mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To redefine the understanding of convolutional filtering processes in CNNs by drawing analogies to fundamental principles in physics, particularly relativistic energy and momentum relationships.

Method: The authors decompose convolutional kernels into orthogonal even (isotropic diffusion) and odd (directional displacement) components and examine their effects on image information propagation. They employ discrete cosine transform (DCT) analysis to describe these properties in the spectral domain.

Result: The study establishes that small convolutional filters (e.g., $3×3$) are dominated by low-frequency bases, linking even and odd kernels with isotropic diffusion and directional displacement of information, respectively. The speed of displacement is proportional to the odd-to-total energy ratio.

Conclusion: This research bridges fundamental concepts in physics with CNN information processing, providing a fresh perspective on the mechanics of convolutional filtering by applying principles of energy and momentum.

Abstract: This paper proposes elementary information mechanics as a new model for understanding the mechanical properties of convolutional filtering with rectification, inspired by physical theories of special relativity and quantum mechanics. We consider kernels decomposed into orthogonal even and odd components. Even components cause image content to diffuse isotropically while preserving the center of mass, analogously to rest or potential energy with zero net momentum. Odd kernels cause directional displacement of the center of mass, analogously to kinetic energy with non-zero momentum. The speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Even-Odd properties are analyzed in the spectral domain via the discrete cosine transform (DCT), where the structure of small convolutional filters (e.g. $3 \times 3$ pixels) is dominated by low-frequency bases, specifically the DC $Σ$ and gradient components $\nabla$, which define the fundamental modes of information propagation. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the link between information processing in generic CNNs and the energy-momentum relation, a cornerstone of modern relativistic physics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DermaVQA-DAS, an extended dataset focusing on dermatology for both question answering and lesion segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the gap in dermatological datasets which lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, aiming to improve patient-centered care.

Method: This study develops the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a framework of 63 detailed questions in two languages, creates annotated datasets, and evaluates multimodal models.

Result: Prompt design and models influence performance. Top segmentation results show Jaccard index of 0.395 and Dice score of 0.566. Best QA models achieve accuracies up to 0.798.

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive resources to advance dermatological vision-language modeling and releases its dataset and protocols for further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

*Bohong Chen,Haiyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyStream is a cutting-edge autoregressive model designed for real-time, ultra-low latency generation of dyadic talking head videos with high lip-sync quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the high latency issue in existing methods for generating talking head videos, which hinders real-time, nonverbal feedback essential for realism.

Method: The authors propose DyStream, which employs an autoregressive model with flow-matching heads and a causal encoder enhanced with a short-lookahead module to balance latency and video quality.

Result: DyStream generates videos with a latency of under 100 ms, achieving state-of-the-art lip-sync scores: 8.13 (offline) and 7.61 (online) on the HDTF dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed model significantly reduces latency while improving video quality, making it suitable for real-time applications requiring realistic dyadic interactions.

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.

*Yan Meng,Daniel A. Donoho,Marcelle Altshuler,Omar Arnaout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an AI-based framework for objectively assessing surgical proficiency, specifically microanastomosis skill, using video analysis and motion tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional surgical training evaluation relies heavily on expert supervision, which is subjective, time-consuming, and often impractical in low-resource settings.

Method: The proposed system integrates video transformers (TimeSformer with tailored attention mechanisms) and YOLO-based object detection to analyze surgical videos and assess specific skill dimensions of microanastomosis.

Result: Experimental results showed 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation (93.62% with post-processing) and 76% accuracy in replicating expert assessments across skill aspects.

Conclusion: The framework offers objective and interpretable feedback to standardize training and evaluation in surgical education, particularly beneficial for scalable implementation.

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the representation of Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders through compositionality and employs the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) framework for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the representations learned by Vision Transformer encoders by focusing on their compositionality, a characteristic that is less studied in vision models compared to language models.

Method: The study adapts a compositionality framework using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to extract primitives and tests the compositionality of ViT representations by checking if composed representations reproduce the original image information.

Result: The study demonstrates that primitives derived from a one-level DWT decomposition result in ViT encoders producing representations that approximately compose well in latent space.

Conclusion: ViT encoders show evidence of compositional structuring of information in latent space, highlighting a novel way of understanding their behavior.

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a compression framework tailored for multispectral solar imagery using modules focused on spectral and spatial details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space missions need efficient compression methods to preserve spectral and spatial details under bandwidth constraints.

Method: The framework uses Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE) for inter-band relations and Windowed Spatial Graph Attention with Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C) for spatial redundancy reduction.

Result: On the SDOML dataset, the method reduces Mean Spectral Information Divergence by 20.15%, improves PSNR by up to 1.09%, and offers 1.62% gain in MS-SSIM.

Conclusion: The approach enhances reconstruction sharpness and spectral fidelity while maintaining comparable compression rates.

Abstract: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights the improvement in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) using Generative AI and proposes a new Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) model to create minimal hallucination outputs for high-fidelity consumer photography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance SISR for consumer photography by minimizing image hallucinations and improving the applicability of generative models for high-resolution input images.

Method: Introduces a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) model, leveraging lower-level conditioning features (DINOv2) instead of text features, to address hallucination issues in SISR.

Result: The proposed F2IDiff model strengthens SISR performance by achieving better control with lower-level feature conditioning, avoiding excessive hallucinations in higher-quality LR images.

Conclusion: The F2IDiff model demonstrates its effectiveness in bridging LR-HR gaps for consumer photography by enhancing SISR with stricter, rich conditioning features that minimize errors.

Abstract: With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.

TL;DR: This paper develops a system integrating YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in X-rays and uses GPT-4 to generate radiology reports, achieving clinical accuracy but style limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap in automated medical imaging systems, which can detect anomalies but lack the capability to generate detailed narrative reports.

Method: The study employs YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images and integrates them with GPT-4 for creating natural-language diagnostic narratives.

Result: YOLO models yielded strong semantic similarity to human-generated reports, and GPT-4 excelled in clarity but showed limitations in writing style naturalness.

Conclusion: The developed system achieves clinical accuracy and clear diagnostic reporting, but its stylistic discrepancy from human-generated text highlights the need for refinement.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MS-VQ-VAE, a scalable and lightweight video compression model for low-resolution videos, suitable for edge devices, yielding superior results for compression and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for bandwidth and storage due to video traffic growth requires novel compression frameworks optimized not only for pixel-domain representation but also for machine learning-centric latent representations.

Method: The proposed Multi-Scale VQ-VAE introduces a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions, optimized for 64x64 resolution videos, incorporates perceptual loss for better reconstruction quality, and is lightweight with only 18.5M parameters.

Result: The model achieves 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM on the test set, outperforming a single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM for validation.

Conclusion: MS-VQ-VAE is an efficient framework for scalable video compression, particularly for applications like real-time streaming, mobile analytics, and CDN storage in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video traffic has placed increasing demands on bandwidth and storage infrastructure, particularly for content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge devices. While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM. The proposed framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization.

Method: The study proposes PhyAugPipe for dataset creation, leveraging vision-language models and chain-of-thought reasoning. It also formulates PhyGDPO, a physics-aware optimization framework with novel rewarding and efficient training schemes.

Result: Experiments show significant improvement in text-to-video performance compared to existing methods, particularly in benchmarks assessing physical accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methods advance the fidelity of text-to-video generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance while focusing on physical consistency and efficient training techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual grounding benchmarks focus on clean environments and lack the complexity of real-world scenarios, limiting the evaluation of model robustness and generalization.

Method: The authors develop RGBT-Ground, a dataset of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal (TIR) images with detailed annotations. They propose RGBT-VGNet, a baseline for fusing RGB and TIR data for robust visual grounding.

Result: RGBT-VGNet surpasses existing methods, especially in challenging conditions like nighttime and long-distance scenarios. The study demonstrates enhanced performance on the new RGBT-Ground dataset.

Conclusion: The paper provides a new robust benchmark and method for visual grounding in complex real-world conditions, encouraging advancements in vision-language tasks. The resources will be publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to localize specific objects in an image according to natural language expressions, serving as a fundamental task in vision-language understanding. However, existing VG benchmarks are mostly derived from datasets collected under clean environments, such as COCO, where scene diversity is limited. Consequently, they fail to reflect the complexity of real-world conditions, such as changes in illumination, weather, etc., that are critical to evaluating model robustness and generalization in safety-critical applications. To address these limitations, we present RGBT-Ground, the first large-scale visual grounding benchmark built for complex real-world scenarios. It consists of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs with high-quality referring expressions, corresponding object bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations at the scene, environment, and object levels. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation and facilitates the study of robust grounding under diverse and challenging conditions. Furthermore, we establish a unified visual grounding framework that supports both uni-modal (RGB or TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) visual inputs. Based on it, we propose RGBT-VGNet, a simple yet effective baseline for fusing complementary visual modalities to achieve robust grounding. We conduct extensive adaptations to the existing methods on RGBT-Ground. Experimental results show that our proposed RGBT-VGNet significantly outperforms these adapted methods, particularly in nighttime and long-distance scenarios. All resources will be publicly released to promote future research on robust visual grounding in complex real-world environments.

*Fuyu Dong,Ke Li,Di Wang,Nan Luo,Yiming Zhang,Kaiyu Li,Jianfei Yang,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DARFT, a framework addressing decision ambiguity in CDVQA tasks by refining models to handle distractors effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CDVQA performance suffers due to decision ambiguity, where models fail to distinctly favor correct answers over strong distractors.

Method: DARFT framework mines decision-ambiguous samples (DAS) with a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) trained policy and applies group-relative policy optimization to improve model performance.

Result: Experiments show DARFT outperforms SFT baselines consistently, especially in scenarios with limited annotated data.

Conclusion: Optimizing decision-ambiguous samples can enhance the robustness and discriminability of CDVQA models, proving effective for real-world applications.

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SliceLens, a framework leveraging LLMs and VLMs for fine-grained identification of error slices in computer vision tasks, alongside a novel benchmark, FeSD, for evaluating error slice discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inadequacies in error slice discovery for multi-instance computer vision tasks, enhancing evaluation robustness with grounded insights.

Method: The framework employs LLMs and VLMs to hypothesize and verify visual failure patterns. It includes FeSD, a new benchmark for precise error slice identification.

Result: SliceLens exhibits state-of-the-art results in error slice discovery, achieving high Precision@10 scores on FeSD, and aids in model performance improvements through refinement.

Conclusion: SliceLens and FeSD provide reliable tools for identifying and addressing fine-grained computer vision model errors, demonstrating substantial performance improvements.

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

Result: Evaluations of Fast Point Transformer, Point Transformer v3, and OA-CNNs showed limited performance of current models in addressing post-disaster scenarios.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the urgent need for advanced 3D segmentation models and the establishment of specialized benchmark datasets for effective post-disaster response.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advancements in 3D segmentation techniques and the development of specialized 3D benchmark datasets to improve post-disaster scene understanding and response.

*Zheng Liu,Jinchao Zhu,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (CLoRA), enhancing parameter efficiency and learning performance for fine-tuning vision transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for vision transformers struggle to balance parameter efficiency and learning performance.

Method: CLoRA combines base-space sharing for efficient projection and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) to promote diverse representations.

Result: CLoRA demonstrates superior learning performance and parameter efficiency on image and point cloud datasets, requiring the fewest GFLOPs in point cloud analysis.

Conclusion: CLoRA successfully balances parameter efficiency and learning performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in 3D visual grounding research for outdoor monitoring scenarios, as current studies lack datasets for such environments, especially those captured by roadside infrastructure sensors.

Method: The paper creates a large-scale, multi-modal dataset called MoniRefer, incorporating manually verified text descriptions and 3D labels. It also develops Moni3DVG, an end-to-end approach combining image, geometry, and point cloud data for effective multi-modal feature learning and localization.

Result: MoniRefer dataset contains over 136,018 objects and 411,128 linguistic expressions from real-world traffic intersections. Moni3DVG exhibits superior performance in comprehensive experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: This work fills a gap in infrastructure-level 3D visual grounding, advancing understanding of traffic scenes and establishing robust benchmarks for further research. Dataset and code are set for release.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges in feature point matching caused by large numbers of outliers, which reduce accuracy and robustness in computer vision tasks.

Method: The proposed method employs stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to enhance semantic information and representation of feature points through layer-by-layer channel fusion and hierarchical attention modules.

Result: Experiments on public datasets (YFCC100M and SUN3D) show the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

Conclusion: This novel approach effectively improves the precision of feature point matching by leveraging hierarchical attention and fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Establishing the correct correspondence of feature points is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

*Qingyu Xu,Runtong Zhang,Zihuan Qiu,Fanman Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses object detection challenges in fire rescue scenarios by developing a dataset ('FireRescue') and proposing an improved FRS-YOLO model to enhance detection under chaotic conditions and structural complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve object detection in fire rescue scenes, particularly in urban environments, which are structurally complex and frequent, while covering key targets crucial for command decisions.

Method: The paper constructs a 'FireRescue' dataset with diverse scenarios and introduces FRS-YOLO, featuring an enhancement attention module for cross-dimensional feature interaction and a dynamic feature sampler to mitigate smoke occlusion and background interference.

Result: The proposed FRS-YOLO model improved detection performance in challenging fire rescue scenarios, especially on targets prone to inter-class confusion and occlusions.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances object detection for fire rescue, enabling more effective command and decision-making by addressing limitations such as environmental complexity and key target identification.

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

*Siyang Wang,Hanting Li,Wei Li,Jie Hu,Xinghao Chen,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RadAR, a parallel framework for visual generation that enhances efficiency by leveraging radial topology and nested attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of traditional autoregressive models in visual generation due to their sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism.

Method: RadAR organizes the token generation process radially, using concentric rings and parallel prediction. A nested attention mechanism ensures output consistency.

Result: RadAR achieves efficient and accurate visual generation, maintaining spatial coherence while accelerating the process.

Conclusion: RadAR demonstrates that radial topology and nested attention can significantly optimize autoregressive visual generation in terms of both speed and quality.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RGTN, a novel physics-inspired framework for tensor network structure search, achieving higher efficiency and effectiveness than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address key challenges in existing tensor network structure search methods, such as computational inefficiency, lack of adaptability, and the inability to optimize multi-scale structures.

Method: RGTN leverages a physics-inspired renormalization group flow technique, enabling dynamic scale transformations and learnable edge gates for efficient and robust optimization.

Result: RGTN outperforms current methods by achieving state-of-the-art compression ratios and running significantly faster (4-600x) in tasks like data compression and video completion.

Conclusion: By integrating multi-scale renormalization and adaptive optimization mechanisms, RGTN provides a more effective and efficient approach to tensor network structure search.

Abstract: Tensor network structure search (TN-SS) aims to automatically discover optimal network topologies and rank configurations for efficient tensor decomposition in high-dimensional data representation. Despite recent advances, existing TN-SS methods face significant limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness across diverse tensor characteristics. They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.

TL;DR: This paper presents EVOL-SAM3, a zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation into an inference-time evolutionary search process, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reasoning segmentation struggle with issues like catastrophic forgetting, domain dependency (SFT), training instability and rigid reward functions (RL), and lack of adaptability in training-free methods.

Method: EVOL-SAM3 iteratively refines prompt hypotheses using a Generate-Evaluate-Evolve loop, leveraging a Visual Arena for fitness assessment and Heterogeneous Arena module for robust selection.

Result: EVOL-SAM3 significantly outperforms both static baselines and supervised state-of-the-art methods on the ReasonSeg benchmark in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust, zero-shot solution for reasoning segmentation, overcoming limitations like insufficient inference adaptability and achieving state-of-the-art performance without supervision.

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlowBlending, a sampling strategy that uses large models in capacity-sensitive stages and small models otherwise, achieving faster inference without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to optimize model performance by recognizing that model capacity requirements differ at various timesteps, focusing resources on stages where capacity matters most.

Method: The authors developed FlowBlending, a multi-model sampling strategy that uses large models in capacity-sensitive stages and small models in intermediate stages. They also establish criteria and velocity-divergence analysis for identifying these stages.

Result: Using FlowBlending, the authors achieved up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs on tested models, while maintaining the quality of outputs. It is compatible with other acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedups.

Conclusion: FlowBlending demonstrates that a stage-aware approach to deploying model capacity can significantly enhance inference efficiency without sacrificing output quality. It provides a practical, scalable solution for accelerating model performance.

Abstract: In this work, we show that the impact of model capacity varies across timesteps: it is crucial for the early and late stages but largely negligible during the intermediate stage. Accordingly, we propose FlowBlending, a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that employs a large model and a small model at capacity-sensitive stages and intermediate stages, respectively. We further introduce simple criteria to choose stage boundaries and provide a velocity-divergence analysis as an effective proxy for identifying capacity-sensitive regions. Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models. FlowBlending is also compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in video-text-to-audio tasks, such as visual dominance, lack of fine-grained controllable generation, and insufficient instruction understanding.

Method: Introduces the EchoFoley task specifying fine-grained controls for sound generation, supported by the EchoFoley-6k dataset, and develops the EchoVidia framework with a slow-fast thinking strategy.

Result: EchoVidia achieves 40.7% improvement in controllability and 12.5% enhancement in perceptual quality compared to previous models.

Conclusion: The EchoFoley task and EchoVidia framework represent a significant advancement in video-grounded sound generation, making it more fine-grained and controllable.

Abstract: Sound effects build an essential layer of multimodal storytelling, shaping the emotional atmosphere and the narrative semantics of videos. Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.

Abstract: The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in real-time novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions. CPJ employs large vision-language models to generate multi-angle captions, refined iteratively via an LLM-as-Judge module, which then inform a dual-answer VQA process for both recognition and management responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, CPJ significantly improves performance: using GPT-5-mini captions, GPT-5-Nano achieves \textbf{+22.7} pp in disease classification and \textbf{+19.5} points in QA score over no-caption baselines. The framework provides transparent, evidence-based reasoning, advancing robust and explainable agricultural diagnosis without fine-tuning. Our code and data are publicly available at: https://github.com/CPJ-Agricultural/CPJ-Agricultural-Diagnosis.

*Ankit Dhiman,Srinath R,Jaswanth Reddy,Lokesh R Boregowda,Venkatesh Babu Radhakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for 3D instance segmentation using Gaussian primitives and a novel Embedding-to-Label process, addressing issues such as inconsistent 2D instance labels and boundary artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D instance and semantic segmentation for enhanced scene understanding while addressing inconsistency in 2D instance labels across views.

Method: The proposed framework merges preprocessing and clustering steps, using learnable feature embeddings in Gaussian primitives and a novel Embedding-to-Label decoding process. A linear layer and triplet loss are applied for stable training and performance improvements, especially at object boundaries.

Result: The method demonstrated superior qualitative and quantitative performance on datasets like ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms.

Conclusion: The unified approach simplifies training, enhances performance, and effectively handles challenges such as boundary artifacts in 3D instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

### [189] [Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794)
*Andrew Tinits,Stephen Mann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a framework allowing a newly proposed method to handle nonlinearities in noisy image processing, especially in high dynamic range (HDR) images, by effectively addressing bias and outliers in the Noise2Noise training method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address Noise2Noise limitations, which struggles with the use of nonlinear functions on noisy targets and high-dynamic-range data affected by outliers, while avoiding the necessity of clean target image training.

Method: The paper develops a theoretical framework to identify classes of nonlinear functions with minimal bias when applied to noisy data and refines noise training methods for HDR images by combining tone mapping and loss functions.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates success in denoising HDR images using only noisy training data, achieving results close to the previous state-of-the-art techniques that required clean target training data.

Conclusion: The authors show that nonlinearities, under specific conditions, can be effectively integrated into Noise2Noise frameworks, broadening its applicability and functionality, especially in HDR image processing.

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

*Jason Armitage,Rico Sennnrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method allowing 2D cross-modal systems to adapt to 3D scenes using a new mutual information-based algorithm and in-scene camera control, improving task performance without pretraining or finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting 2D cross-modal systems to 3D scenes due to the dimensional gap between the input and target outputs, particularly when object occlusions occur.

Method: The method involves using derivative-free optimisation to minimise regret while estimating multivariate mutual information, integrating this with value-driven camera control to adjust to noisy outputs of vision-language models.

Result: The approach allows cross-modal systems trained on 2D inputs to perform effectively in 3D multi-object scenes, despite occlusions, and avoids the need for additional pretraining or finetuning.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively bridges the 2D-3D gap in cross-modal tasks, providing a practical, efficient solution to improve visual-language understanding in 3D settings.

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

*Meng Lan,Lefei Zhang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OFL-SAM2 is introduced to adapt SAM2 for medical image segmentation without manual prompts, overcoming the challenges of annotated data scarcity and labor-intensive processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of adapting SAM2 for medical image segmentation, including the need for extensive annotated medical data and manual expert involvement, which are labor-intensive and challenging to scale.

Method: The OFL-SAM2 framework is proposed. It uses a lightweight mapping network to capture medical knowledge and an online few-shot learning approach, alongside an adaptive fusion module to integrate SAM2 features without requiring manual prompts.

Result: OFL-SAM2 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three diverse medical image segmentation datasets while requiring limited annotated data for training.

Conclusion: The proposed method proves effective in adapting SAM2 for label-efficient medical image segmentation, solving previous limitations using innovative techniques like an online few-shot learner and adaptive feature fusion.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated remarkable promptable visual segmentation capabilities in video data, showing potential for extension to medical image segmentation (MIS) tasks involving 3D volumes and temporally correlated 2D image sequences. However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation. Extensive experiments on three diverse MIS datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.

Motivation: This paper aims to address the gap in evaluating MLLMs' ability to handle complex, real-world financial reasoning and analysis by providing a robust benchmark.

Method: FinMMDocR introduces a dataset of 1,200 expert-annotated problems covering diverse financial scenarios, documents with substantial visual elements, and tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. The benchmark tests MLLM performance on intricate computations and reasoning.

Result: The benchmark shows significant challenges for existing MLLMs, with the best-performing model achieving only 58.0% accuracy. RAG methods reveal varying levels of effectiveness in dealing with the task.

Conclusion: FinMMDocR highlights the current limitations of MLLMs in handling complex multimodal financial reasoning tasks and is expected to drive advancements in reasoning-enhanced MLLM methodologies.

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lidar domain adaptation method using neuron activation patterns to enhance generalization across different regions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal annotation effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the poor generalization of 3D object detectors across different domains, such as geographic regions, which is critical for robust autonomous vehicle perception.

Method: The paper presents a lidar domain adaptation technique leveraging neuron activation patterns, by selecting a small, diverse subset of annotated samples and employing post-training techniques inspired by continual learning to prevent model weight drift.

Result: The proposed approach achieves superior performance compared to linear probing and other state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, with a minimal annotation budget.

Conclusion: Annotating a carefully selected, small, and diverse set of target domain samples combined with the proposed techniques significantly enhances generalization, offering a scalable solution for lidar-based object detectors.

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source film restoration techniques struggle with synthetic training data, noisy optical flows, and lack flexibility in handling high-resolution films, necessitating more effective methods.

Method: The framework employs patch-wise training/testing for single-GPU usage, integrates advanced modules (Global Prompt, Frame Fusion, and frequency-based reconstruction), and leverages a real-degraded and synthetic dataset.

Result: Experimental results prove HaineiFRDM's superior defect restoration capability compared to existing open-source approaches.

Conclusion: HaineiFRDM effectively restores film defects, with promising advancements in methodology for high-resolution scenarios. Code and datasets will be openly shared.

Abstract: Existing open-source film restoration methods show limited performance compared to commercial methods due to training with low-quality synthetic data and employing noisy optical flows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ProDM, a diffusion model designed to accurately quantify coronary artery calcium (CAC) from non-gated chest CT scans by correcting motion artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiac and respiratory motion artifacts affect the accuracy of calcium scoring in non-gated CT scans, limiting their use in population screening, despite their accessibility and affordability.

Method: The authors developed ProDM, a generative diffusion framework with three key innovations: motion simulation for supervised training, calcium-specific priors for lesion integrity, and progressive artifact correction for stability and fidelity.

Result: Experiments on real patient data showed ProDM improved CAC scoring accuracy, lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance, compared to baseline methods. Clinical evaluation confirmed enhanced usability by reducing motion artifacts.

Conclusion: ProDM highlights the promise of property-aware and progressive correction approaches in achieving reliable CAC quantification from widely available non-gated chest CT scans.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evaluation framework for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), addressing limitations of current single-frame assessments and proposing a process-aware approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for GVR often rely on single-frame evaluations, leading to issues like outcome-hacking, where correct outputs arise from flawed processes.

Method: The authors propose VIPER, a benchmark covering 16 reasoning tasks, and a new metric called POC@r, which evaluates both intermediate steps and final outcomes using a hierarchical approach.

Result: State-of-the-art video models show limited performance (approximately 20% on POC@1.0) and demonstrate significant outcome-hacking behavior.

Conclusion: There is a notable gap between current video generation models and generalized visual reasoning; the authors aim to fill this gap through their benchmark and evaluation methods.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation have demonstrated an emerging capability termed Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning, where models resolve complex tasks through the generation of continuous frames. While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ShowUI-$π$, a generative model for dexterous interaction in GUI environments, focusing on continuous and unified discrete actions like drag and click for enhanced human-like automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop intelligent agents that perform human-like dexterous manipulation in GUIs, overcoming the limitation of existing methods that only support discrete actions like clicks and not continuous interactions such as dragging.

Method: The proposed method integrates unified discrete and continuous actions using a flow-based generative model that predicts smooth drag trajectories. It introduces a new training dataset with 20K drag trajectories and a benchmark (ScreenDrag) for assessing GUI agents.

Result: ShowUI-$π$ outperforms existing GUI agents on ScreenDrag, scoring 26.98 compared to 13.27 by Operator and 22.18 by Gemini-2.5-CUA, despite having fewer parameters (450M) than competitors.

Conclusion: ShowUI-$π$ establishes a new standard for GUI agents, bridging the gap towards human-like dexterous control in digital environments and showcasing the potential of unified action modeling for superior interaction. The work highlights the complexity of GUI manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.

Motivation: To address the need for deploying compressed deep learning models on resource-constrained devices while maintaining robustness to natural corruption.

Method: The study evaluates compression techniques (quantization, pruning, and weight clustering) individually and in combination on ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2. The models were tested using CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C datasets under multi-objective assessment.

Result: Some compression methods not only preserve but may enhance robustness, especially for complex architectures. The study also identifies optimal configurations of compression techniques for balancing accuracy, robustness, and compression ratio.

Conclusion: Customized and carefully chosen compression methods enable robust, efficient deployment of deep learning models even in corrupted environments.

Abstract: Compressed deep learning models are crucial for deploying computer vision systems on resource-constrained devices. However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio. Our results show that certain compression strategies not only preserve but can also improve robustness, particularly on networks with more complex architectures. Utilizing multiobjective assessment, we determine the best configurations, showing that customized technique combinations produce beneficial multi-objective results. This study provides insights into selecting compression methods for robust and efficient deployment of models in corrupted real-world environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces and addresses a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-Identification (RFL-ReID), proposing a Bi-C2R framework to resolve challenges in gallery feature compatibility and re-identification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of catastrophic forgetting, privacy concerns, and high computational costs in lifelong person re-identification caused by re-indexing historical gallery images.

Method: The authors propose the Bi-C2R framework, which continuously updates gallery features to ensure compatibility between new and old model outputs for efficient re-identification without re-indexing.

Result: The Bi-C2R framework achieves leading performance on both RFL-ReID and traditional L-ReID tasks, validated through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on benchmarks.

Conclusion: This study highlights that the Bi-C2R framework effectively balances lifelong learning, privacy preservation, and compatibility in person re-identification tasks, addressing key challenges in RFL-ReID.

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

Motivation: Previous flow-based monocular SLAM approaches lack geometric consistency, resulting in inaccuracies and reduced robustness. This paper seeks to address these limitations by incorporating geometric guidance and consistency.

Method: The paper introduces a Hybrid Flow Network for geometry-aware correspondences, a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer for global consistency, and a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism to enhance flow updates by discerning between reliable and uncertain regions.

Result: FoundationSLAM surpasses existing methodologies in trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across diverse datasets, all while operating in real-time at 18 FPS, showcasing strong generalization and practical application.

Conclusion: FoundationSLAM bridges flow estimation and geometric reasoning, addressing major limitations in prior SLAM systems, and establishes a more robust, accurate, and real-time performative SLAM method.

Abstract: We present FoundationSLAM, a learning-based monocular dense SLAM system that addresses the absence of geometric consistency in previous flow-based approaches for accurate and robust tracking and mapping. Our core idea is to bridge flow estimation with geometric reasoning by leveraging the guidance from foundation depth models. To this end, we first develop a Hybrid Flow Network that produces geometry-aware correspondences, enabling consistent depth and pose inference across diverse keyframes. To enforce global consistency, we propose a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer that jointly optimizes keyframe pose and depth under multi-view constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that dynamically adapts the flow update process by distinguishing between reliable and uncertain regions, forming a closed feedback loop between matching and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationSLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, while running in real-time at 18 FPS, demonstrating strong generalization to various scenarios and practical applicability of our method.

### [201] [From Inpainting to Editing: A Self-Bootstrapping Framework for Context-Rich Visual Dubbing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25066)
*Xu He,Haoxian Zhang,Hejia Chen,Changyuan Zheng,Liyang Chen,Songlin Tang,Jiehui Huang,Xiaoqiang Liu,Pengfei Wan,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces a novel framework for audio-driven visual dubbing leveraging a diffusion transformer to refocus the problem as a video-to-video editing task, enabling accurate lip synchronization, identity preservation, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in audio-driven visual dubbing struggle with the lack of ideal training data and visual artifacts caused by mask-based inpainting approaches.

Method: The authors utilize a Diffusion Transformer: first as a data generator to synthesize paired videos, and then as an audio-driven video editor trained on these pairs using complete visual context and a timestep-adaptive learning strategy.

Result: The method achieved highly accurate lip synchronization, faithful identity preservation, robustness in challenging scenarios, and introduced ContextDubBench for evaluation.

Conclusion: Framing visual dubbing as a well-conditioned video editing task rather than an inpainting problem significantly improves syncing quality, visual fidelity, and robustness in practical applications.

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

*Dian Shao,Mingfei Shi,Like Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineTec framework addresses fine-grained action recognition challenges from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences, achieving notable improvements in both coarse-grained and fine-grained benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in recognizing subtle motion cues due to temporal corruption in skeleton sequences observed in real-world scenarios, especially with incomplete pose estimation data.

Method: FineTec involves skeleton restoration using context-aware completion, semantic-based spatial decomposition with dynamic/static subgrouping, physics-driven joint acceleration estimation using Lagrangian dynamics, and GCN-based action recognition with fused position/acceleration sequences.

Result: FineTec achieves high accuracies (89.1% and 78.1%) on severely corrupted fine-grained benchmarks (Gym99, Gym288), outperforming prior approaches while being robust against temporal corruption.

Conclusion: FineTec demonstrates enhanced robustness and generalization for fine-grained action recognition tasks under challenging temporal corruption settings.

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

*Jiageng Liu,Weijie Lyu,Xueting Li,Yejie Guo,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Edit3r,' a framework for fast and accurate 3D scene reconstruction and edits from unposed, view-inconsistent images, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing 3D scene editing methods that require per-scene optimization and pose estimation, which are often slow and inconsistent.

Method: Edit3r employs a feed-forward neural network trained with a SAM2-based recoloring strategy for consistent supervision and asymmetric input to align disparate image observations without requiring pose-estimation.

Result: Edit3r achieves fast and photorealistic 3D scene rendering with superior semantic alignment and 3D consistency. It demonstrates improved performance on the newly introduced DL3DV-Edit-Bench, handling diverse edit types efficiently.

Conclusion: The framework provides a significant step forward for real-time 3D editing applications, thanks to its high speed and superior accuracy compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: We present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications.

TL;DR: GaMO improves sparse-view 3D reconstruction by expanding existing views, maintaining geometric consistency, and enhancing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitations of sparse multi-view 3D reconstruction, including limited coverage, geometric inconsistencies, and high computational costs, in existing methods.

Method: Proposes GaMO, a geometry-aware multi-view outpainting framework that expands the field of view from existing camera poses using multi-view conditioning and denoising without the need for training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction quality on Replica and ScanNet++ datasets with significant improvements in PSNR and LPIPS, and processes 25× faster than diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: GaMO establishes a new standard for efficient and high-quality 3D reconstruction from sparse views, overcoming limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud pipelines face challenges such as dynamic workloads, cost constraints, and governance requirements, with limitations in current static configurations.

Method: The platform uses specialized bounded AI agents for telemetry analysis, policy reasoning, and constrained operational actions with policy validation.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows reduced recovery time by 45%, lower cost by 25%, and 70% fewer manual interventions while maintaining compliance.

Conclusion: Policy-based bounded AI control in cloud pipelines effectively enhances operational efficiency and governance in enterprise scenarios.

Abstract: Cloud data pipelines increasingly operate under dynamic workloads, evolving schemas, cost constraints, and strict governance requirements. Despite advances in cloud-native orchestration frameworks, most production pipelines rely on static configurations and reactive operational practices, resulting in prolonged recovery times, inefficient resource utilization, and high manual overhead. This paper presents Agentic Cloud Data Engineering, a policy-aware control architecture that integrates bounded AI agents into the governance and control plane of cloud data pipelines. In Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform, specialized agents analyze pipeline telemetry and metadata, reason over declarative cost and compliance policies, and propose constrained operational actions such as adaptive resource reconfiguration, schema reconciliation, and automated failure recovery. All agent actions are validated against governance policies to ensure predictable and auditable behavior. We evaluate Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform using representative batch and streaming analytics workloads constructed from public enterprise-style datasets. Experimental results show that Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform reduces mean pipeline recovery time by up to 45%, lowers operational cost by approximately 25%, and decreases manual intervention events by over 70% compared to static orchestration, while maintaining data freshness and policy compliance. These results demonstrate that policy-bounded agentic control provides an effective and practical approach for governing cloud data pipelines in enterprise environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenge of managing task heterogeneity and limited resources in edge servers to improve processing efficiency and resource utilization.

Method: The paper employs profiling experiments to derive a nonlinear model, formulates a MINLP problem, and develops a two-stage resource management scheme combining convex optimization with greedy refinement.

Result: The proposed method reduces latency by over 14% and enhances energy efficiency compared to baseline approaches, as demonstrated through simulations.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient, scalable, and practical solution for managing resources in edge environments with dynamic workloads, addressing latency and energy usage challenges.

Abstract: Edge computing enables latency-critical applications to process data close to end devices, yet task heterogeneity and limited resources pose significant challenges to efficient orchestration. This paper presents a measurement-driven, container-based resource management framework for intra-node optimization on a single edge server hosting multiple heterogeneous applications. Extensive profiling experiments are conducted to derive a nonlinear fitting model that characterizes the relationship among CPU/memory allocations and processing latency across diverse workloads, enabling reliable estimation of performance under varying configurations and providing quantitative support for subsequent optimization. Using this model and a queueing-based delay formulation, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly minimize system latency and power consumption, which is shown to be NP-hard. The problem is decomposed into tractable convex subproblems and solved through a two-stage container-based resource management scheme (CRMS) combining convex optimization and greedy refinement. The proposed scheme achieves polynomial-time complexity and supports quasi-dynamic execution under global resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that CRMS reduces latency by over 14\% and improves energy efficiency compared with heuristic and search-based baselines, offering a practical and scalable solution for heterogeneous edge environments with dynamic workload characteristics.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the inefficiencies in Federated Learning due to data heterogeneity among clients. It introduces a client selection and resource allocation approach to minimize learning latency, energy consumption, and enhance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenges posed by resource constraints and significant client data heterogeneity in federated learning settings, which lead to inefficiencies such as increased training cycles and higher resource consumption.

Method: The authors propose a joint client selection and resource allocation (CSRA) scheme, using convex optimization and relaxation techniques to address the formulated optimization problem.

Result: Simulation results show that the CSRA method provides higher test accuracy, reduced training latency, and lower energy consumption in comparison to existing methods that disregard data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The CSRA scheme effectively improves the efficiency and effectiveness of federated learning systems by addressing data heterogeneity challenges while minimizing latency and energy usage.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables mobile edge devices, functioning as clients, to collaboratively train a decentralized model while ensuring local data privacy. However, the efficiency of FL in wireless networks is limited not only by constraints on communication and computational resources but also by significant data heterogeneity among clients, particularly in large-scale networks. This paper first presents a theoretical analysis of the impact of client data heterogeneity on global model generalization error, which can result in repeated training cycles, increased energy consumption, and prolonged latency. Based on the theoretical insights, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize learning latency and energy consumption while constraining generalization error. A joint client selection and resource allocation (CSRA) approach is then proposed, employing a series of convex optimization and relaxation techniques. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CSRA scheme yields higher test accuracy, reduced learning latency, and lower energy consumption compared to baseline methods that do not account for data heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces PackKV, a framework for efficient key-value (KV) cache management in large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory requirements and enhancing throughput for long-context inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The memory-intensive nature of KV cache in transformer-based LLMs creates a bottleneck for long-context inference, necessitating efficient memory management solutions.

Method: The authors developed PackKV, which implements lossy compression techniques tailored to the properties of KV cache data, while ensuring compatibility with dynamically growing caches and maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: PackKV achieves an average memory reduction of 153.2% for K cache and 179.6% for V cache with minimal accuracy loss. It also improves throughput by 75.7% for K and 171.7% for V compared to baseline methods on GPUs.

Conclusion: PackKV demonstrates that advanced lossy compression and optimized system architecture can effectively address memory and throughput challenges in LLMs, enabling more efficient long-context inference handling.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across a wide range of practical applications. However, long-context inference remains a significant challenge due to the substantial memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to several gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present \textbf{PackKV}, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-context generation. %, which synergistically supports both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference scenarios. PackKV introduces novel lossy compression techniques specifically tailored to the characteristics of KV cache data, featuring a careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach is compatible with the dynamically growing nature of the KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that, under the same and minimum accuracy drop as state-of-the-art quantization methods, PackKV achieves, on average, \textbf{153.2}\% higher memory reduction rate for the K cache and \textbf{179.6}\% for the V cache. Furthermore, PackKV delivers extremely high execution throughput, effectively eliminating decompression overhead and accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation. Specifically, PackKV achieves an average throughput improvement of \textbf{75.7}\% for K and \textbf{171.7}\% for V across A100 and RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, compared to cuBLAS matrix-vector multiplication kernels, while demanding less GPU memory bandwidth.

*Mikaila J. Gossman,Avinash Maurya,Bogdan Nicolae,Jon C. Calhoun*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper investigates the challenges of checkpointing for large language model (LLM) and foundation model training at scale, focusing on I/O performance bottlenecks. The authors analyze strategies using liburing for improved throughput, providing comparative benchmark results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Checkpointing has become critical for the efficient training and inference of LLMs and foundation models due to their reliance on frequent data saving to stable storage. However, current methods face significant performance bottlenecks, particularly in high-concurrency environments, necessitating optimized I/O strategies.

Method: The authors developed microbenchmarks to evaluate the impact of aggregation, alignment, and I/O coalescing strategies using liburing under buffered and direct I/O modes. They compared the proposed solution's performance to existing LLM checkpointing engines.

Result: The proposed methodology achieved up to 3.9× higher write throughput than DataStates-LLM and 7.6× higher throughput than TorchSnapshot by optimizing checkpointing operations with file system-aware aggregation and coalescing techniques.

Conclusion: This study emphasizes the importance of leveraging aggregation and coalescing strategies tailored to modern file systems and I/O libraries like liburing in addressing checkpoint-related bottlenecks for LLMs, providing a scalable and efficient approach for data persistence in model training.

Abstract: As LLMs and foundation models scale, checkpoint/restore has become a critical pattern for training and inference. With 3D parallelism (tensor, pipeline, data), checkpointing involves many processes, each managing numerous tensors of varying shapes and sizes, that must be persisted frequently to stable storage (e.g., parallel file systems). This turns checkpoint/restore into a big-data I/O problem characterized by volume, variety, and velocity. The workflow must traverse the full storage stack -- from GPU memory through host memory and local storage to external repositories -- whose tiers differ by orders of magnitude in performance, creating bottlenecks under concurrency even with asynchronous flush/prefetch. Kernel-accelerated I/O libraries such as \texttt{liburing} may mitigate these issues versus POSIX, but their effectiveness for LLM checkpointing remains underexplored. We develop microbenchmarks to quantify trade-offs when using \texttt{liburing}, evaluating how aggregation, alignment, and I/O coalescing interact under buffered and direct I/O. We find that uncoalesced small-buffer operations halve throughput relative to synthetic workloads, while file system-aware aggregation restores bandwidth and reduces metadata overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM checkpointing engines, our approach achieves up to $3.9\times$ higher write throughput than DataStates-LLM and $7.6\times$ higher than TorchSnapshot. These results highlight the need for aggregation and coalescing strategies that align with modern file systems and I/O backends.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel distributed bilevel optimization framework to address challenges in low-resource clients using a second-order free hypergradient estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in applying traditional bilevel optimization algorithms to low-resource clients due to high computational requirements.

Method: A resource-adaptive framework (RABO and RAFBO) with a second-order free hypergradient estimator for optimizing submodels based on available resources.

Result: Proposed methods achieve an asymptotically optimal convergence rate and demonstrate effectiveness and computational efficiency in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The presented methods successfully address computational challenges in distributed bilevel optimization for low-resource clients while ensuring optimal efficiency and convergence.

Abstract: With the development of large-scale models, traditional distributed bilevel optimization algorithms cannot be applied directly in low-resource clients. The key reason lies in the excessive computation involved in optimizing both the lower- and upper-level functions. Thus, we present the first resource-adaptive distributed bilevel optimization framework with a second-order free hypergradient estimator, which allows each client to optimize the submodels adapted to the available resources. Due to the coupled influence of partial outer parameters x and inner parameters y, it's challenging to theoretically analyze the upper bound regarding the globally averaged hypergradient for full model parameters. The error bound of inner parameter also needs to be reformulated since the local partial training. The provable theorems show that both RABO and RAFBO can achieve an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{C_x^{\ast}Q})$, which is dominated by the minimum coverage of the outer parameter $C_x^{\ast}$. Extensive experiments on two different tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and computation efficiency of our proposed methods.

Method: An AI-driven approach that integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decisions, and feedback by analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical data to dynamically manage resources across clusters.

Result: A prototype demonstrated enhanced resource efficiency, quicker adaptation during workload changes, and reduced performance variability compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The study proves intelligent, self-adaptive resource management as crucial for creating scalable and resilient multi-cluster cloud platforms.

Abstract: Modern cloud-native systems increasingly rely on multi-cluster deployments to support scalability, resilience, and geographic distribution. However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness of intelligent, self-adaptive infrastructure management as a key enabler for scalable and resilient cloud platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML workflows spanning many GPUs face inefficiencies due to network faults and the limitations of existing recovery methods, as they often lead to job terminations and resource wastage.

Method: Introduces R$^2$CCL, a communication library leveraging multi-NIC hardware for lossless failover, incorporating features like connection migration, bandwidth-aware load redistribution, and resilient algorithms.

Result: R$^2$CCL demonstrated robust performance with minimal overheads during failures: <1% for training and <3% for inference, outperforming AdapCC and DejaVu substantially.

Conclusion: R$^2$CCL effectively reduces failure-induced inefficiencies in large-scale ML setups, outperforming existing baseline solutions and maintaining operational progress under challenging failure conditions.

Abstract: Modern ML training and inference now span tens to tens of thousands of GPUs, where network faults can waste 10--15\% of GPU hours due to slow recovery. Common network errors and link fluctuations trigger timeouts that often terminate entire jobs, forcing expensive checkpoint rollback during training and request reprocessing during inference. We present R$^2$CCL, a fault-tolerant communication library that provides lossless, low-overhead failover by exploiting multi-NIC hardware. R$^2$CCL performs rapid connection migration, bandwidth-aware load redistribution, and resilient collective algorithms to maintain progress under failures. We evaluate R$^2$CCL on two 8-GPU H100 InfiniBand servers and via large-scale ML simulators modeling hundreds of GPUs with diverse failure patterns. Experiments show that R$^2$CCL is highly robust to NIC failures, incurring less than 1\% training and less than 3\% inference overheads. R$^2$CCL outperforms baselines AdapCC and DejaVu by 12.18$\times$ and 47$\times$, respectively.

Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of hardware-efficient learning and inference for physical AI at the edge, particularly focusing on model recovery (MR) under stringent latency, compute, and power constraints.

Method: MERINDA employs a novel hardware-friendly formulation using GRU-based discretized dynamics, dense inverse-ODE layers, sparsity-driven dropout, and lightweight ODE solvers, optimized for streaming parallelism on FPGA.

Result: MERINDA achieves 114× lower energy usage, 28× smaller memory footprint, and 1.68× faster training compared to GPUs while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy in model recovery across benchmark systems.

Conclusion: MERINDA enables practical, accurate, and explainable model recovery on resource-constrained edge devices, making real-time monitoring feasible for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Physical AI at the edge -- enabling autonomous systems to understand and predict real-world dynamics in real time -- requires hardware-efficient learning and inference. Model recovery (MR), which identifies governing equations from sensor data, is a key primitive for safe and explainable monitoring in mission-critical autonomous systems operating under strict latency, compute, and power constraints. However, state-of-the-art MR methods (e.g., EMILY and PINN+SR) rely on Neural ODE formulations that require iterative solvers and are difficult to accelerate efficiently on edge hardware. We present \textbf{MERINDA} (Model Recovery in Reconfigurable Dynamic Architecture), an FPGA-accelerated MR framework designed to make physical AI practical on resource-constrained devices. MERINDA replaces expensive Neural ODE components with a hardware-friendly formulation that combines (i) GRU-based discretized dynamics, (ii) dense inverse-ODE layers, (iii) sparsity-driven dropout, and (iv) lightweight ODE solvers. The resulting computation is structured for streaming parallelism, enabling critical kernels to be fully parallelized on the FPGA. Across four benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, MERINDA delivers substantial gains over GPU implementations: \textbf{114$\times$ lower energy} (434~J vs.\ 49{,}375~J), \textbf{28$\times$ smaller memory footprint} (214~MB vs.\ 6{,}118~MB), and \textbf{1.68$\times$ faster training}, while matching state-of-the-art model-recovery accuracy. These results demonstrate that MERINDA can bring accurate, explainable MR to the edge for real-time monitoring of autonomous systems.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the computational challenges of large language models (LLMs) by introducing a framework combining weight pruning, low-bit quantization, and hardware-software co-design to optimize LLM inference on various hardware platforms, achieving significant storage and latency reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit high performance but are hindered by heavy computational and memory demands, making their deployment in limited-resource environments difficult.

Method: The framework integrates N:M structured pruning and 4-bit quantization to minimize memory use, coupled with dequantization and matrix multiplication optimizations, employing CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, and custom FPGA accelerators.

Result: The approach reduces weight storage by up to 4× and achieves a 1.71× speedup in matrix multiplication, with a 1.29× end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. It also improves throughput per token on LLaMA-7B by 1.36×.

Conclusion: Fine-grained sparsity and quantization significantly enhance LLM inference efficiency and deployment flexibility, particularly with the FPGA accelerator supporting diverse sparsity patterns beyond fixed hardware constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language processing tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively models gaming network behavior and demonstrates its potential for improved understanding, analysis, and classification of gaming networks.

Abstract: Online gaming is a popular activity involving the adoption of complex systems and network infrastructures. The relevance of gaming, which generates large amounts of market revenue, drove research in modeling network devices' behavior to evaluate bandwidth consumption, predict and sustain high loads, and detect malicious activity. In this context, process mining appears promising due to its ability to combine data-driven analyses with model-based insights. In this paper, we propose a process mining-based method that analyzes gaming network traffic, allowing: unsupervised characterization of different states from gaming network data; encoding such states through process mining into interpretable Petri nets; and classification of gaming network traffic data to identify different video games being played. We apply the method to the UPSIDE case study, involving gaming network data of several devices interacting with two video games: Clash Royale and Rocket League. Results demonstrate that the gaming network behavior can be effectively and interpretably modeled through states represented as Petri nets with sufficient coherence (94.02% inter-device similarity) and specificity (174.99% inter-state separation) while maintaining a good classification accuracy of the two different video games (73.84% AUC).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents an empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art approaches to fix faults in deep learning (DL) systems, considering performance, robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning systems, widely adopted in various industries, are prone to faults that can cause significant risks, necessitating effective fixing approaches.

Method: The study evaluates 16 DL fixing approaches (model, layer, and neuron levels) using diverse datasets, architectures, and domains under a uniform experimental setup to assess fixing effectiveness and impact on critical properties.

Result: Model-level approaches show superior fixing effectiveness, but no single approach can optimize fixing performance, accuracy, and maintain all properties. Research should address these trade-offs.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize gaps in current methods and suggest future research directions, focusing on balancing fixing effectiveness with other critical properties like robustness and fairness.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has been widely adopted in diverse industrial domains, including autonomous driving, intelligent healthcare, and aided programming. Like traditional software, DL systems are also prone to faults, whose malfunctioning may expose users to significant risks. Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects. These insights highlight promising directions for future exploration in this field.

*Haley Rosso,Talea Mayo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reviews the use of diffusion models, a type of generative model, for simulation-based inference tasks, focusing on their robustness and application to scientific data with challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulation-based inference methods are needed as classical likelihood-based methods are often unsuitable for problems with intractable likelihood functions. Diffusion models have emerged as a flexible framework to address these challenges.

Method: The paper reviews mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling, compares them to normalizing flows, and highlights approaches to address scientific data complexities like mismatches, unstructured data, and missing components.

Result: The paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of methods for diffusion-based SBI, highlighting their robustness under difficult conditions and discussing advancements that address scientific data-related challenges.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based SBI is promising for robust parameter inference in complex simulation scenarios, despite trade-offs like iterative sampling costs, and opens directions for future research in scientific modeling and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: For complex simulation problems, inferring parameters of scientific interest often precludes the use of classical likelihood-based techniques due to intractable likelihood functions. Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\mathbfθ$ given observed data $\mathbf{x}_{\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve human-level concept learning and improve efficiency in document classification with minimal data usage and computational resources.

Method: The CM^2 model identifies structural 'important features' of documents, enabling classification with only one sample per class while being computationally efficient and environmentally sustainable.

Result: CM^2 outperforms traditional and deep learning models by achieving high accuracy, one-shot learning, faster computation, and robustness, while being explainable and economically viable.

Conclusion: CM^2 demonstrates that a focus on structural intelligence can significantly improve machine learning efficiency, providing a sustainable alternative to resource-heavy AI approaches.

Abstract: Human-level concept learning argues that humans typically learn new concepts from a single example, whereas machine learning algorithms typically require hundreds of samples to learn a single concept. Our brain subconsciously identifies important features and learns more effectively. \vspace*{6pt}
  Contribution: In this paper, we present the Coordinate Matrix Machine (CM$^2$). This purpose-built small model augments human intelligence by learning document structures and using this information to classify documents. While modern "Red AI" trends rely on massive pre-training and energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, CM$^2$ is designed as a Green AI solution. It achieves human-level concept learning by identifying only the structural "important features" a human would consider, allowing it to classify very similar documents using only one sample per class.
  Advantage: Our algorithm outperforms traditional vectorizers and complex deep learning models that require larger datasets and significant compute. By focusing on structural coordinates rather than exhaustive semantic vectors, CM$^2$ offers: 1. High accuracy with minimal data (one-shot learning) 2. Geometric and structural intelligence 3. Green AI and environmental sustainability 4. Optimized for CPU-only environments 5. Inherent explainability (glass-box model) 6. Faster computation and low latency 7. Robustness against unbalanced classes 8. Economic viability 9. Generic, expandable, and extendable

### [219] [Geometric Scaling of Bayesian Inference in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23752)
*Naman Aggarwal,Siddhartha R. Dalal,Vishal Misra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether the geometric structures seen in small transformer models trained for Bayesian inference in controlled settings persist in larger, production-grade language models. It finds evidence for this structure and explores its role during in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine if production-level language models retain the same geometric encoding of Bayesian inference structures observed in simpler synthetic settings, thereby advancing understanding of uncertainty representation in AI models.

Method: The authors analyze various modern language models (Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, Mistral) to study their geometric structures and entropy alignment. They perform experimental interventions to examine the impact of disrupting these geometries during in-context learning.

Result: The models retain the geometric structure for Bayesian inference. However, disrupting this structure impacts uncertainty representation without severely affecting Bayesian-like behavior, suggesting the structure is a readout rather than a computational bottleneck.

Conclusion: Modern language models encode a geometric substrate for approximate Bayesian inference, preserving and organizing their uncertainty representation. This structure plays a significant yet non-exclusive role in their computation.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that small transformers trained in controlled "wind-tunnel'' settings can implement exact Bayesian inference, and that their training dynamics produce a geometric substrate -- low-dimensional value manifolds and progressively orthogonal keys -- that encodes posterior structure. We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.
  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate.

### [220] [Generalized Regularized Evidential Deep Learning Models: Theory and Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23753)
*Deep Shankar Pandey,Hyomin Choi,Qi Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses an issue in evidential deep learning (EDL) models related to activation-dependent learning freeze and proposes a new family of activation functions and regularizers for consistent evidence updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evidential deep learning models struggle with constrained evidence and small gradients in low-evidence regions, hindering learning. This issue motivates improving uncertainty quantification and learning dynamics.

Method: The paper theoretically analyzes learning freeze and proposes new activation functions and evidential regularizers, enabling consistent evidence updates across activation regimes.

Result: The proposed method is validated with experiments on multiple benchmarks, few-shot classification, and a blind face restoration problem, showing improvements in performance and evidential learning consistency.

Conclusion: Generalized activation functions and regularizers improve EDL models by addressing the gradient problem and enhancing uncertainty quantification capabilities.

Abstract: Evidential deep learning (EDL) models, based on Subjective Logic, introduce a principled and computationally efficient way to make deterministic neural networks uncertainty-aware. The resulting evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using learned evidence. However, the Subjective-Logic framework constrains evidence to be non-negative, requiring specific activation functions whose geometric properties can induce activation-dependent learning-freeze behavior: a regime where gradients become extremely small for samples mapped into low-evidence regions. We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark classification problems (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), two few-shot classification problems, and blind face restoration problem empirically validate the developed theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generalized regularized evidential models.

### [221] [Generalising E-prop to Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24506)
*Beren Millidge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends the E-prop framework to enable online learning in deep recurrent networks without relying on backpropagation through time, addressing limitations in multi-layer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The brain's ability to learn online motivates developing algorithms that are computationally feasible and biologically plausible, addressing the inefficiencies of BPTT and computational complexity of RTRL.

Method: The authors derive a novel recursion relationship that generalizes E-prop for arbitrarily deep recurrent networks, enabling eligibility traces to extend to deeper layers.

Result: The framework achieves accurate credit assignment across time and depth, facilitating the training of deep recurrent networks using an online learning approach.

Conclusion: The proposed extension overcomes the challenges of training deep recurrent networks by combining computational efficiency with biological plausibility, avoiding backpropagation through time.

Abstract: Recurrent networks are typically trained with backpropagation through time (BPTT). However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time.

*Sheo Yon Jhin,Noseong Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HINTS, a self-supervised model to improve time series forecasting by extracting human influence endogenously from residuals instead of relying on external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in time series forecasting where external data sources introduce financial, computational, and practical burdens while modeling human decision-making and psychology impacts.

Method: The framework combines self-supervised learning and Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics to extract latent human factors from residuals. The factors are used as attention maps in backbone models for improved prediction.

Result: HINTS outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting methods in accuracy across nine datasets and demonstrates interpretability via alignment with real-world events.

Conclusion: HINTS effectively models human factors in time series without external data, offering improved accuracy and interpretability, thus reducing resource dependency.

Abstract: Human decision-making, emotions, and collective psychology are complex factors that shape the temporal dynamics observed in financial and economic systems. Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent factors endogenously from time series residuals without external data. HINTS leverages the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model as a structural inductive bias to model evolving social influence, memory, and bias patterns. The extracted human factors are integrated into a state-of-the-art backbone model as an attention map. Experimental results using nine real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that HINTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, multiple case studies and ablation studies validate the interpretability of HINTS, demonstrating strong semantic alignment between the extracted factors and real-world events, demonstrating the practical utility of HINTS.

*Esha Saha,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MUSIC is a sparse multitask neural network framework enabling accurate modeling of coupled systems with partial data and physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in combining partial physical knowledge and incomplete data for modeling complex coupled systems using machine learning methods.

Method: Developed a sparsity-induced multitask neural network framework (MUSIC), integrating physical constraints and data-driven learning, with mesh-free sampling and sparsity regularization.

Result: MUSIC achieved accurate solutions to complex coupled systems (e.g., shock wave and pattern formation) under sparse data and noise conditions, outperforming non-sparse methods.

Conclusion: MUSIC is effective for modeling systems with incomplete physical knowledge and data, offering a robust solution framework with better efficiency.

Abstract: Advances in data acquisition and computational methods have accelerated the use of differential equation based modelling for complex systems. Such systems are often described by coupled (or more) variables, yet governing equation is typically available for one variable, while the remaining variable can be accessed only through data. This mismatch between known physics and observed data poses a fundamental challenge for existing physics-informed machine learning approaches, which generally assume either complete knowledge of the governing equations or full data availability across all variables. In this paper, we introduce MUSIC (Multitask Learning Under Sparse and Incomplete Constraints), a sparsity induced multitask neural network framework that integrates partial physical constraints with data-driven learning to recover full-dimensional solutions of coupled systems when physics-constrained and data-informed variables are mutually exclusive. MUSIC employs mesh-free (random) sampling of training data and sparsity regularization, yielding highly compressed models with improved training and evaluation efficiency. We demonstrate that MUSIC accurately learns solutions (shock wave solutions, discontinuous solutions, pattern formation solutions) to complex coupled systems under data-scarce and noisy conditions, consistently outperforming non-sparse formulations. These results highlight MUSIC as a flexible and effective approach for modeling partially observed systems with incomplete physical knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of substantial labeled data requirements for neural architecture search (NAS) in designing multimodal deep neural networks (DNNs), which are structurally complex and need efficient feature fusion.

Method: The method integrates self-supervised learning (SSL) for both the architecture search and the pretraining of multimodal DNNs, eliminating the need for large labeled datasets.

Result: The SSL-based method effectively designed architectures for multimodal DNNs using unlabeled training data.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that self-supervised learning can efficiently aid in NAS for multimodal DNNs, reducing dependency on labeled data while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the architectural design process of deep neural networks (DNN), has attracted increasing attention. Multimodal DNNs that necessitate feature fusion from multiple modalities benefit from NAS due to their structural complexity; however, constructing an architecture for multimodal DNNs through NAS requires a substantial amount of labeled training data. Thus, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for architecture search of multimodal DNNs. The proposed method applies SSL comprehensively for both the architecture search and model pretraining processes. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method successfully designed architectures for DNNs from unlabeled training data.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new subspace clustering algorithm using Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) incorporated into the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline. It improves clustering performance and mathematical structure retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the quality and reliability of clustering tasks in datasets represented by subspaces by introducing a more effective geometric representative approach (SVBF).

Method: The paper introduces the Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) as a trainable prototype for subspaces. It integrates SVBF into the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline to perform clustering tasks.

Result: The SVBF-LBG scheme demonstrated improved cluster purity on synthetic, image, spectral, and video datasets, confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently improves subspace clustering with SVBF, retaining mathematical structures for further analysis in diverse applications.

Abstract: In many classification and clustering tasks, it is useful to compute a geometric representative for a dataset or a cluster, such as a mean or median. When datasets are represented by subspaces, these representatives become points on the Grassmann or flag manifold, with distances induced by their geometry, often via principal angles. We introduce a subspace clustering algorithm that replaces subspace means with a trainable prototype defined as a Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) - a subspace that comes as close as possible to intersecting each cluster member in at least one fixed direction. Integrated in the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline, this SVBF-LBG scheme yields improved cluster purity on synthetic, image, spectral, and video action data, while retaining the mathematical structure required for downstream analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses network traffic classification challenges and proposes a methodology to evaluate dataset stability using concept drift detection and ML feature weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network traffic classification models degrade over time due to evolving protocols and concept drift, necessitating improved measures for dataset stability and optimization.

Method: A novel methodology utilizing concept drift detection and machine learning feature weights has been developed to assess dataset stability and create a benchmarking workflow.

Result: The methodology was validated on the CESNET-TLS-Year22 dataset, establishing stability benchmarks and identifying areas for dataset optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively evaluates and enhances dataset stability, providing insights for optimization and better performance in dynamic network environments.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) represents an efficient and popular approach for network traffic classification. However, network traffic classification is a challenging domain, and trained models may degrade soon after deployment due to the obsolete datasets and quick evolution of computer networks as new or updated protocols appear. Moreover, significant change in the behavior of a traffic type (and, therefore, the underlying features representing the traffic) can produce a large and sudden performance drop of the deployed model, known as a data or concept drift. In most cases, complete retraining is performed, often without further investigation of root causes, as good dataset quality is assumed. However, this is not always the case and further investigation must be performed. This paper proposes a novel methodology to evaluate the stability of datasets and a benchmark workflow that can be used to compare datasets.
  The proposed framework is based on a concept drift detection method that also uses ML feature weights to boost the detection performance. The benefits of this work are demonstrated on CESNET-TLS-Year22 dataset. We provide the initial dataset stability benchmark that is used to describe dataset stability and weak points to identify the next steps for optimization. Lastly, using the proposed benchmarking methodology, we show the optimization impact on the created dataset variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve optimal experimental design in inverse problems by tackling challenges like the need for classical bilevel optimization, indirect sparsity regularization, and computational inefficiency.

Method: NODE uses a unified learning-based framework in which a neural reconstruction model and design variables (e.g., sensor locations) are trained in a single optimization loop, directly enforcing sparsity and improving computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed method was validated on benchmarks like exponential growth, MNIST image sampling, and sparse view X-ray CT, outperforming baselines in reconstruction accuracy and task performance.

Conclusion: NODE proves to be an effective and computationally efficient method for designing sparse experiments, eliminating the need for classical techniques such as l1 regularization and bilevel optimization.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Optimal Design of Experiments, a learning-based framework for optimal experimental design in inverse problems that avoids classical bilevel optimization and indirect sparsity regularization. NODE jointly trains a neural reconstruction model and a fixed-budget set of continuous design variables representing sensor locations, sampling times, or measurement angles, within a single optimization loop. By optimizing measurement locations directly rather than weighting a dense grid of candidates, the proposed approach enforces sparsity by design, eliminates the need for l1 tuning, and substantially reduces computational complexity. We validate NODE on an analytically tractable exponential growth benchmark, on MNIST image sampling, and illustrate its effectiveness on a real world sparse view X ray CT example. In all cases, NODE outperforms baseline approaches, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy and task-specific performance.

*Alexander C. Li,Ananya Kumar,Deepak Pathak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how generative classifiers can outperform discriminative classifiers in handling classification under distribution shifts by modeling all features and reducing reliance on spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges faced by discriminative classifiers in scenarios with distribution shifts due to reliance on spuriously correlated features.

Method: Utilizes class-conditional generative models like diffusion-based and autoregressive classifiers, simplifying training by avoiding augmentations and specialized regularization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five standard distribution shift benchmarks and reduces spurious correlations' impact in applications like medical and satellite datasets.

Conclusion: Generative classifiers can be more robust than discriminative ones under distribution shifts, supported by both empirical results and a detailed Gaussian toy analysis.

Abstract: Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.

TL;DR: The paper presents ZTA-FL, a secure and robust Federated Learning framework for IIoT intrusion detection, addressing vulnerabilities in existing FL systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical infrastructure security is threatened by attacks on IIoT deployments, requiring advancements in intrusion detection methods.

Method: ZTA-FL introduces TPM-based authentication, SHAP-weighted aggregation for Byzantine detection, and privacy-preserving adversarial training to defend against attacks.

Result: Experimental validation shows ZTA-FL achieves high detection accuracy (97.8%), resilience against Byzantine attacks (93.2%), and adversarial robustness (89.3%) with reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: ZTA-FL improves IIoT security with innovative methods and strong experimental performance, addressing urgent cybersecurity challenges.

Abstract: Recent attacks on critical infrastructure, including the 2021 Oldsmar water treatment breach and 2023 Danish energy sector compromises, highlight urgent security gaps in Industrial IoT (IIoT) deployments. While Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative intrusion detection, existing frameworks remain vulnerable to Byzantine poisoning attacks and lack robust agent authentication. We propose Zero-Trust Agentic Federated Learning (ZTA-FL), a defense in depth framework combining: (1) TPM-based cryptographic attestation achieving less than 0.0000001 false acceptance rate, (2) a novel SHAP-weighted aggregation algorithm providing explainable Byzantine detection under non-IID conditions with theoretical guarantees, and (3) privacy-preserving on-device adversarial training. Comprehensive experiments across three IDS benchmarks (Edge-IIoTset, CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15) demonstrate that ZTA-FL achieves 97.8 percent detection accuracy, 93.2 percent accuracy under 30 percent Byzantine attacks (outperforming FLAME by 3.1 percent, p less than 0.01), and 89.3 percent adversarial robustness while reducing communication overhead by 34 percent.

TL;DR: CENNSurv is a deep learning method for survival analysis, effectively handling time-dependent exposures with interpretability and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in modeling time-dependent exposure effects on survival outcomes in large datasets, where traditional methods struggle with scalability and interpretability.

Method: Introduced CENNSurv, a deep learning approach designed to uncover dynamic risk relationships in time-dependent data.

Result: When tested on two datasets, CENNSurv identified significant time-lagged associations and short-term behavioral shifts, showcasing its capacity to handle complex temporal patterns.

Conclusion: CENNSurv offers researchers a scalable, interpretable tool for analyzing cumulative effects on survival outcomes.

Abstract: In epidemiological research, modeling the cumulative effects of time-dependent exposures on survival outcomes presents a challenge due to their intricate temporal dynamics. Conventional spline-based statistical methods, though effective, require repeated data transformation for each spline parameter tuning, with survival analysis computations relying on the entire dataset, posing difficulties for large datasets. Meanwhile, existing neural network-based survival analysis methods focus on accuracy but often overlook the interpretability of cumulative exposure patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce CENNSurv, a novel deep learning approach that captures dynamic risk relationships from time-dependent data. Evaluated on two diverse real-world datasets, CENNSurv revealed a multi-year lagged association between chronic environmental exposure and a critical survival outcome, as well as a critical short-term behavioral shift prior to subscription lapse. This demonstrates CENNSurv's ability to model complex temporal patterns with improved scalability. CENNSurv provides researchers studying cumulative effects a practical tool with interpretable insights.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to design mixing matrices in wireless decentralized federated learning (DFL) that aim to minimize maximum per-node energy consumption, considering both convergence rate and energy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current approaches for mixing matrix designs in decentralized federated learning (DFL) focus on optimizing communication time but neglect the critical issue of minimizing per-node energy consumption, which is significant for energy-constrained devices.

Method: A novel, theoretically-supported framework for time-varying mixing matrix design is proposed. It optimizes wireless communication topologies and budgets to balance energy consumption and convergence rates, based on a new convergence theorem for arbitrarily varying mixing matrices.

Conclusion: In decentralized federated learning over wireless networks, energy efficiency can be improved by optimizing mixing matrix designs, confirming the practicality of the proposed method to balance energy consumption and convergence efficiency.

Abstract: We consider the design of mixing matrices to minimize the operation cost for decentralized federated learning (DFL) in wireless networks, with focus on minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption. As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes. Our evaluations based on real data have validated the efficacy of the proposed solution in combining the low energy consumption of sparse mixing matrices and the fast convergence of dense mixing matrices.

*Ankit Kanwar,Dominik Wagner,Luke Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a robust RL algorithm, SB-TRPO, which rigorously adheres to safety while improving rewards and outperforms existing methods in safety-critical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in RL of simultaneously ensuring safety constraints are adhered to without sacrificing reward performance, particularly in safety-critical domains.

Method: The proposed SB-TRPO algorithm combines trust-region policy optimization with adaptive biasing towards constraint satisfaction, using a convex combination of the cost and reward gradients to ensure safety and optimal cost reduction at every step.

Result: SB-TRPO achieved outstanding performance on safety tasks, demonstrating a balanced achievement of safety adherence and task completion, surpassing existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: SB-TRPO effectively ensures safety in RL while maintaining competitive reward performance, making it a promising approach for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical domains requires agents to maximise rewards while strictly adhering to safety constraints. Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned. Experiments on standard and challenging Safety Gymnasium tasks show that SB-TRPO consistently achieves the best balance of safety and meaningful task completion compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Interactive machine learning explores active data collection and decision making to overcome labeled data and high-stakes challenges, proposing efficient algorithms that achieve savings and improved theoretical foundations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in acquiring high-quality labeled data and safe decision-making in large-scale or sensitive applications.

Method: Developing interactive learning principles and algorithms for active learning, sequential decision making, and model selection under partial feedback.

Result: Introduction of efficient active learning algorithms with exponential label savings, scalable contextual bandit approaches, and precise cost characterizations for model selection.

Conclusion: Advances theoretical groundwork for interactive learning, combining statistical optimality and computational efficiency for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, yet many of its most effective methods rely on access to large amounts of labeled data or extensive online interaction. In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making. Overall, this dissertation advances the theoretical foundations of interactive learning by developing algorithms that are statistically optimal and computationally efficient, while also providing principled guidance for deploying interactive learning methods in large-scale, real-world settings.

*Molei Qin,Xinyu Cai,Yewen Li,Haochong Xia,Chuqiao Zong,Shuo Sun,Xinrun Wang,Bo An*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FineFT, an ensemble RL framework for cryptocurrency futures trading, addressing training challenges in high-leverage settings and improving risk management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance trading strategies in the cryptocurrency futures market, addressing challenges of reward fluctuation due to high leverage and the lack of self-awareness in existing RL models for handling unpredictable market states.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage ensemble RL framework called FineFT: Stage I involves selective updates of ensemble Q learners for stable training, Stage II uses VAEs to identify market state boundaries and filter learners, and Stage III employs a risk-aware ensemble policy blending to adapt to market changes.

Result: FineFT outperformed 12 state-of-the-art baselines, achieving over 40% risk reduction and superior profitability in high-leverage crypto futures trading environments. Experimental evaluations highlighted its effectiveness in various financial metrics.

Conclusion: FineFT is a robust method for cryptocurrency futures trading that integrates efficient ensemble learning and risk-aware mechanisms, demonstrating enhanced performance and reduced risks compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Futures are contracts obligating the exchange of an asset at a predetermined date and price, notable for their high leverage and liquidity and, therefore, thrive in the Crypto market. RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance.

### [235] [Improved Balanced Classification with Theoretically Grounded Loss Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23947)
*Corinna Cortes,Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces and analyzes two new loss functions, Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA), for solving multi-class classification in imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of class imbalance in multi-class classification, ensuring fairness and proper representation of minority classes without overlooking their significance.

Method: The paper proposes two advanced surrogate loss families: GLA losses (extending logit-adjusted losses) and GCA losses (enhancing class-weighted losses). It provides theoretical Bayes- and $H$-consistency analyses, and conducts experiments to evaluate empirical performance.

Result: It is shown that GCA losses offer better $H$-consistency guarantees with favorable bounds under class imbalance, while both GLA and GCA perform better than existing methods in empirical tests. GLA outperforms in common benchmarks, while GCA is better in highly imbalanced settings.

Conclusion: GLA and GCA loss functions are effective solutions for class imbalance problems in multi-class classification, showing improved guarantees and empirical performance over conventional methods.

Abstract: The balanced loss is a widely adopted objective for multi-class classification under class imbalance. By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\mathsf p_{\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\sqrt{\mathsf p_{\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings.

Key innovations include an R-style formula interface for accessibility, support for directed acyclic graph (DAG) constraints for causal structure learning, Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) kernels for spatial modeling, and comprehensive interpretability tools including SHAP values and variance decomposition. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility through applications to longitudinal data analysis, genomic prediction, and spatial-temporal modeling. TabMixNN provides a unified interface for researchers to leverage deep learning while maintaining the interpretability and theoretical grounding of classical mixed-effects models.

### [238] [Assured Autonomy: How Operations Research Powers and Orchestrates Generative AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23978)
*Tinglong Dai,David Simchi-Levi,Michelle Xiao Wu,Yao Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the transition of Generative AI towards autonomous decision-making systems and proposes a framework for assured autonomy to tackle challenges of operational safety and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of fragility in operational domains as Generative AI systems gain autonomy, emphasizing the need for structure, constraints, and discipline against risks.

Method: The paper develops a framework for assured autonomy using flow-based generative models for deterministic transport and adversarial robustness approaches to handle worst-case perturbations.

Result: The framework provides mechanisms for auditability, constraint-aware generation, and robust decision-making to ensure system stability and safety.

Conclusion: Operational research must evolve from problem-solving to system architecting, ensuring control logic, safety protocols, and reliable design for increasingly autonomous GenAI systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is shifting from conversational assistants toward agentic systems -- autonomous decision-making systems that sense, decide, and act within operational workflows. This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.

*Wenqian Weng,Yi He,Xingyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the theoretical foundations for aligning language models privately and robustly under privacy and corruption constraints, establishing suboptimality gap bounds in offline and online settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how privacy and adversarial corruption impact the alignment of language models and derive optimal strategies for robust and private alignment.

Method: The authors analyze preference labels subject to privacy constraints and adversarial corruption, exploring privacy-first and corruption-first setups. They use theoretical methods including uniform convergence guarantees and log/square loss analysis.

Result: The paper demonstrates improved bounds for privacy-only and joint privacy-and-corruption settings, reveals stronger offline algorithm guarantees, and presents the first results for private, robust online alignment.

Conclusion: The findings suggest significant advancements in understanding the interplay of privacy and corruption in language model alignment, providing broader applicability in learning theory and statistics.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the private and robust alignment of language models from a theoretical perspective by establishing upper bounds on the suboptimality gap in both offline and online settings. We consider preference labels subject to privacy constraints and/or adversarial corruption, and analyze two distinct interplays between them: privacy-first and corruption-first. For the privacy-only setting, we show that log loss with an MLE-style algorithm achieves near-optimal rates, in contrast to conventional wisdom. For the joint privacy-and-corruption setting, we first demonstrate that existing offline algorithms in fact provide stronger guarantees -- simultaneously in terms of corruption level and privacy parameters -- than previously known, which further yields improved bounds in the corruption-only regime. In addition, we also present the first set of results for private and robust online alignment. Our results are enabled by new uniform convergence guarantees for log loss and square loss under privacy and corruption, which we believe have broad applicability across learning theory and statistics.

### [240] [Paired Seed Evaluation: Statistical Reliability for Learning-Based Simulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24145)
*Udit Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 'paired seed evaluation' approach for comparing machine learning systems that reduces statistical variance and improves evaluation efficiency by adopting shared sources of randomness across alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter the high variance and unreliable outcomes in evaluating machine learning systems that arise due to stochastic components like random initialization and learning stochasticity.

Method: A paired seed evaluation design is proposed, where competing systems are tested on identical random seeds to match the stochastic components between systems, minimizing evaluation variance.

Result: The paired seed evaluation showed significant reductions in variance, tighter confidence intervals, and improved computational efficiency by exploiting seed-level correlations.

Conclusion: Paired seed evaluation is a more reliable and efficient method for comparative evaluation of systems, achieving gains in statistical power without losing validity in scenarios where there is no correlation.

Abstract: Machine learning systems appear stochastic but are deterministically random, as seeded pseudorandom number generators produce identical realisations across executions. Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains. Paired seed evaluation is weakly dominant in practice, improving statistical reliability when correlation is present and reducing to independent evaluation without loss of validity when it is not.

*Mahdi Karami,Ali Behrouz,Peilin Zhong,Razvan Pascanu,Vahab Mirrokni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-scale state-space model (MS-SSM) framework for efficient sequence modeling, addressing limitations like limited memory and the inability to capture multi-scale dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-space models are limited by ineffective memory and difficulty in capturing multi-scale dependencies, which are crucial for applications in time series, images, and natural language.

Method: The proposed MS-SSM framework represents sequence dynamics across multiple resolutions, processes each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics, and introduces an input-dependent scale-mixer for dynamic information fusion.

Result: MS-SSM achieves superior performance in sequence modeling tasks, particularly in long-range and hierarchical problems, as validated on benchmarks like Long Range Arena, time series classification, and image recognition.

Conclusion: The MS-SSM framework improves memory efficiency, captures multi-scale dependencies, and outperforms prior SSM-based models in terms of computational and modeling efficiency.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently attention as an efficient alternative to computationally expensive attention-based models for sequence modeling. They rely on linear recurrences to integrate information over time, enabling fast inference, parallelizable training, and control over recurrence stability. However, traditional SSMs often suffer from limited effective memory, requiring larger state sizes for improved recall. Moreover, existing SSMs struggle to capture multi-scale dependencies, which are essential for modeling complex structures in time series, images, and natural language. This paper introduces a multi-scale SSM framework that addresses these limitations by representing sequence dynamics across multiple resolution and processing each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics. By capturing both fine-grained, high-frequency patterns and coarse, global trends, MS-SSM enhances memory efficiency and long-range modeling. We further introduce an input-dependent scale-mixer, enabling dynamic information fusion across resolutions. The proposed approach significantly improves sequence modeling, particularly in long-range and hierarchical tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, including Long Range Arena, hierarchical reasoning, time series classification, and image recognition, demonstrate that MS-SSM consistently outperforms prior SSM-based models, highlighting the benefits of multi-resolution processing in state-space architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bridge-TS, a method for generative time series imputation utilizing an improved prior informed by pretrained models for enhanced accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of previous generative models, which relied on non-informative priors, leading to higher computational load and less accurate imputation of missing time series values.

Method: Bridge-TS leverages two novel concepts: (1) expert prior, using pretrained transformer models to provide deterministic estimations for missing values, which serve as a guide, and (2) compositional priors, integrating different pretrained models to collaboratively improve imputation accuracy.

Result: Bridge-TS demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as ETT, Exchange, and Weather, surpassing existing methods in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error.

Conclusion: Utilizing informative and compositional priors significantly enhances the generative process and achieves superior accuracy in time series imputation tasks compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Time series imputation, i.e., filling the missing values of a time recording, finds various applications in electricity, finance, and weather modelling. Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets such as ETT, Exchange, and Weather show that Bridge-TS reaches a new record of imputation accuracy in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, demonstrating the superiority of improving prior for generative time series imputation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face limitations due to quadratic computational complexity and unbounded growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which hampers scalability and real-time processing capabilities.

Method: Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory. It employs a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism and an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate to dynamically update and retain critical contextual information in memory at test time.

Result: The proposed architecture outperforms strong baselines in experiments on various tasks, such as language modeling, common-sense reasoning, and recall-intensive tasks. The performance advantage becomes more pronounced with increasing sequence length.

Conclusion: Trellis offers an efficient, scalable Transformer architecture that maintains competitive performance, showing promise for applications requiring long-context understanding and processing.

Abstract: Transformers, while powerful, suffer from quadratic computational complexity and the ever-growing Key-Value (KV) cache of the attention mechanism. This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory. To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time. Extensive experiments on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive tasks, and time series show that the proposed architecture outperforms strong baselines. Notably, its performance gains increase as the sequence length grows, highlighting its potential for long-context applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces sparse-penalization frameworks for high-dimensional Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification, including methods using Lasso, SCAD, and MCP penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of applying sparse regularization in high-dimensional Positive-Confidence (Pconf) settings, which only utilize positive samples with confidence scores and lack negative data.

Method: Develop estimators using Lasso and non-convex penalties (SCAD, MCP). Propose a proximal gradient algorithm to optimize the composite objective and derive error bounds for sparse recovery.

Result: The proposed methods achieve high predictive accuracy and feature recovery rates in high-dimensional Pconf classification, performing comparably to fully supervised methodologies.

Conclusion: This work effectively adapts sparse regularization techniques to the high-dimensional Pconf setting, merging weak supervision with high-dimensional statistical models.

Abstract: High-dimensional learning problems, where the number of features exceeds the sample size, often require sparse regularization for effective prediction and variable selection. While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve predictive performance and variable selection accuracy comparable to fully supervised approaches, effectively bridging the gap between weak supervision and high-dimensional statistics.

Motivation: To improve neural process models by simplifying implementation and enhancing performance in learning stochastic processes from data.

Method: The paper proposes an NP model leveraging flow-matching generative modeling, where predictions are made by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE); it also offers a tradeoff between accuracy and running time based on ODE solver steps.

Result: The new NP model achieves better performance than prior NP methods across various benchmarks, including synthetic 1D Gaussian processes, 2D images, and real-world weather data.

Conclusion: The introduced flow-matching-based NP model advances the field by offering a simple, effective, and flexible approach for handling conditional distributions.

Abstract: Neural processes (NPs) are a class of models that learn stochastic processes directly from data and can be used for inference, sampling and conditional sampling. We introduce a new NP model based on flow matching, a generative modeling paradigm that has demonstrated strong performance on various data modalities. Following the NP training framework, the model provides amortized predictions of conditional distributions over any arbitrary points in the data. Compared to previous NP models, our model is simple to implement and can be used to sample from conditional distributions using an ODE solver, without requiring auxiliary conditioning methods. In addition, the model provides a controllable tradeoff between accuracy and running time via the number of steps in the ODE solver. We show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural process methods on various benchmarks including synthetic 1D Gaussian processes data, 2D images, and real-world weather data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in financial sentiment analysis using small datasets, which standard NLP models struggle to handle effectively.

Method: The study compared Word2Vec, GloVe, and sentence transformers combined with gradient boosting for classifying financial news sentiment.

Result: Pretrained embeddings underperform with insufficient data, and small validation sets lead to overfitting, revealing the limitations of embedding methods in data-scarce scenarios.

Conclusion: Embedding quality doesn't compensate for data scarcity, and alternative methods like data augmentation or lexicon-hybrid approaches are necessary when data is limited.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis enhances market understanding; however, standard natural language processing approaches encounter significant challenges when applied to small datasets. This study provides a comparative evaluation of embedding-based methods for financial news sentiment classification in resource-constrained environments. Word2Vec, GloVe, and sentence transformer representations are evaluated in combination with gradient boosting on manually labeled headlines. Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics. The analysis demonstrates that pretrained embeddings yield diminishing returns below a critical data sufficiency threshold, and that small validation sets contribute to overfitting during model selection. Practical application is illustrated through weekly sentiment aggregation and narrative summarization for market monitoring workflows. The findings offer empirical evidence that embedding quality alone cannot address fundamental data scarcity in sentiment classification. For practitioners operating with limited resources, the results indicate the need to consider alternative approaches such as few-shot learning, data augmentation, or lexicon-enhanced hybrid methods when labeled samples are scarce.

Abstract: Speculative decoding improves LLM inference by generating and verifying multiple tokens in parallel, but existing systems suffer from suboptimal performance due to a mismatch between dynamic speculation and static runtime assumptions. We present Yggdrasil, a co-designed system that enables latency-optimal speculative decoding through context-aware tree drafting and compiler-friendly execution. Yggdrasil introduces an equal-growth tree structure for static graph compatibility, a latency-aware optimization objective for draft selection, and stage-based scheduling to reduce overhead.

*Yuma Ichikawa,Yoshihiko Fujisawa,Yudai Fujimoto,Akira Sakai,Katsuki Fujisawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF) for low-bit quantization of large language models to improve inference efficiency and accuracy, surpassing previous binary formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme low-bit quantization methods like Double Binary Factorization face performance saturation due to restrictive scaling parameters, limiting their potential for efficient and accurate model inference.

Method: The proposed MDBF replaces DBF's single magnitude profile with a rank-l envelope shared among binary sign matrices. It also incorporates a closed-form initialization and an optimization method to refine performance.

Result: MDBF outperforms existing binary formats by improving perplexity and zero-shot accuracy while maintaining efficient inference and matched bits per weight.

Conclusion: MDBF enables improved quantization of language models, offering better performance without sacrificing deployment efficiency or memory budget.

Abstract: For extreme low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs), Double Binary Factorization (DBF) is attractive as it enables efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy. However, the scaling parameters of DBF are too restrictive; after factoring out signs, all rank components share the same magnitude profile, resulting in performance saturation. We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.

TL;DR: The paper presents small-scale pretraining for Small Language Models (SLMs) using Infini-attention, achieving improved performance for long-context retrieval in compact models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient use of limited data and compute, improve accessibility in low-resource settings, and reduce costs in training Small Language Models.

Method: Utilized 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention, which builds compressed memory from past segments while maintaining local attention. Empirical studies were conducted to assess performance.

Result: Infini-attention showed training stability and outperformed the baseline in long-context retrieval tasks, achieving up to 31% higher accuracy despite some performance degradation over long sequences.

Conclusion: Infini-attention can enhance long-context capabilities in SLMs, compensating for their parameter limitations and enabling better performance in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: This study investigates small-scale pretraining for Small Language Models (SLMs) to enable efficient use of limited data and compute, improve accessibility in low-resource settings and reduce costs. To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences. Even so, Infini-attention still effectively compensates for the SLM's limited parameters. Particularly, despite performance degradation at a 16,384-token context, the Infini-attention model achieves up to 31% higher accuracy than the baseline. Our findings suggest that achieving robust long-context capability in SLMs benefits from architectural memory like Infini-attention.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a more expressive variant of the SAC algorithm by using flow-based models for policy representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the efficiency and robustness limits of simple policy classes in SAC by using flow-based models for a more expressive and robust solution.

Method: The algorithm utilizes flow-based policies with instantaneous change-of-variable techniques and incorporates importance sampling flow matching (ISFM) for policy updates.

Result: The authors provide a theoretical analysis of ISFM and demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully applying it to max-entropy linear quadratic regulator problems.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively handles complex policies, improving SAC's expressiveness and robustness, and achieves optimal action distributions in tested scenarios.

Abstract: Soft actor-critic (SAC) is a popular algorithm for max-entropy reinforcement learning. In practice, the energy-based policies in SAC are often approximated using simple policy classes for efficiency, sacrificing the expressiveness and robustness. In this paper, we propose a variant of the SAC algorithm that parameterizes the policy with flow-based models, leveraging their rich expressiveness. In the algorithm, we evaluate the flow-based policy utilizing the instantaneous change-of-variable technique and update the policy with an online variant of flow matching developed in this paper. This online variant, termed importance sampling flow matching (ISFM), enables policy update with only samples from a user-specified sampling distribution rather than the unknown target distribution. We develop a theoretical analysis of ISFM, characterizing how different choices of sampling distributions affect the learning efficiency. Finally, we conduct a case study of our algorithm on the max-entropy linear quadratic regulator problems, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm learns the optimal action distribution.

Motivation: Accurately forecasting Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is vital for managing solar energy variability in power grids.

Method: Comparing ten deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) using high-resolution satellite data from 2011-2020, while employing SHAP analysis and Knowledge Distillation techniques.

Result: Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (R^2 of 0.9696). Innovations like Knowledge Distillation compressed the model by 23.5% while reducing prediction error.

Conclusion: Transformer shows superior predictive power and practicality for edge devices when combined with Knowledge Distillation, offering energy grid benefits.

Abstract: Reliable forecasting of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is essential for mitigating the variability of solar energy in power grids. This study presents a comprehensive benchmark of ten deep learning architectures for short-term (1-hour ahead) GHI time series forecasting in Ho Chi Minh City, leveraging high-resolution NSRDB satellite data (2011-2020) to compare established baselines (e.g. LSTM, TCN) against emerging state-of-the-art architectures, including Transformer, Informer, iTransformer, TSMixer, and Mamba. Experimental results identify the Transformer as the superior architecture, achieving the highest predictive accuracy with an R^2 of 0.9696. The study further utilizes SHAP analysis to contrast the temporal reasoning of these architectures, revealing that Transformers exhibit a strong "recency bias" focused on immediate atmospheric conditions, whereas Mamba explicitly leverages 24-hour periodic dependencies to inform predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Knowledge Distillation can compress the high-performance Transformer by 23.5% while surprisingly reducing error (MAE: 23.78 W/m^2), offering a proven pathway for deploying sophisticated, low-latency forecasting on resource-constrained edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stagewise Pairwise Mixers (SPM), a structured linear operator substituting dense layers in machine learning, reducing computational cost and enhancing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense linear layers, despite being computationally expensive, often lack alignment with the compositional structure of learned representations.

Method: The SPM replaces dense matrices with sparse pairwise-mixing stages, achieving global linear transformations in reduced time and parameters while providing closed-form computations.

Result: Experiments show reduced computational cost and improved accuracy on structured tasks with competitive performance on real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPM offers a computationally efficient and generalization-friendly alternative to dense layers in various architectures.

Abstract: Dense linear layers are a dominant source of computational and parametric cost in modern machine learning models, despite their quadratic complexity and often being misaligned with the compositional structure of learned representations. We introduce Stagewise Pairwise Mixers (SPM), a structured linear operator that replaces dense matrices with a composition of sparse pairwise-mixing stages. An SPM layer implements a global linear transformation in $O(nL)$ time with $O(nL)$ parameters, where $L$ is typically constant or $log_2n$, and admits exact closed-form forward and backward computations. SPM is designed as a drop-in replacement for dense linear layers in feedforward networks, recurrent architectures, attention mechanisms, etc. We derive complete forward and backward expressions for two parameterizations: an orthogonal norm-preserving rotation-based variant and a fully general $2 \times 2$ mixing variant. Beyond computational savings, the stagewise structure of SPM induces an explicit compositional inductive bias that constrains model capacity and improves generalization when aligned with task structure. We present proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating substantial reductions in wall-clock cost and improved accuracy on structured learning problems, while retaining competitive performance on real-world benchmarks.

*Xia Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how biological-like temporal inductive biases, stemming from physical constraints, can enhance generalization in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap between unconstrained optimization in conventional deep learning and the biologically inspired, constrained dynamics that encourage generalization.

Method: The authors use phase-space analysis to examine signal propagation dynamics and introduce external and intrinsic constraints to shape temporal inductive biases.

Result: Their experiments demonstrate that a critical transition regime optimizes generalization across diverse tasks like classification, reconstruction, and reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of temporal dynamics as inductive biases for robust AI, advocating for mastering such structures beyond mere scaling of models.

Abstract: Conventional deep learning prioritizes unconstrained optimization, yet biological systems operate under strict metabolic constraints. We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical "transition" regime maximizes generalization capability. These findings establish dynamical constraints as a distinct class of inductive bias, suggesting that robust AI development requires not only scaling and removing limitations, but computationally mastering the temporal characteristics that naturally promote generalization.

*Kacem Khaled,Felipe Gohring de Magalhães,Gabriela Nicolescu*

TL;DR: The paper introduces DivQAT, a novel algorithm enhancing the robustness of quantized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) against extraction attacks by integrating defense during Quantization Aware Training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantized CNNs are susceptible to extraction attacks, and current defenses are either post-training additions or computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for edge device implementation.

Method: A novel Quantization Aware Training technique, DivQAT, is proposed to integrate defense mechanisms during the model's quantization process.

Result: The proposed method, validated on benchmark vision datasets, effectively defends against extraction attacks while maintaining model accuracy.

Conclusion: DivQAT enhances extraction attack defenses for quantized CNNs and can be combined with other defense methods to further improve effectiveness.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their quantized counterparts are vulnerable to extraction attacks, posing a significant threat of IP theft. Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy. Furthermore, combining our quantization technique with other defense mechanisms improves their effectiveness compared to traditional QAT.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of traditional physics-based flood models makes them unsuitable for quick predictions critical in operational disaster management.

Method: The study introduces DUALFloodGNN, a GNN architecture with physical constraints incorporated via explicit loss terms. It uses a shared message-passing framework to predict water volume and flow, with enhanced training through multi-step loss and dynamic curriculum learning.

Result: DUALFloodGNN outperforms conventional GNNs and state-of-the-art flood models, offering better prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The new architecture improves flood model predictions while being computationally efficient, providing a valuable tool for flood management tasks. The model is open-sourced to encourage further usage and development.

Abstract: Flood models inform strategic disaster management by simulating the spatiotemporal hydrodynamics of flooding. While physics-based numerical flood models are accurate, their substantial computational cost limits their use in operational settings where rapid predictions are essential. Models designed with graph neural networks (GNNs) provide both speed and accuracy while having the ability to process unstructured spatial domains. Given its flexible input and architecture, GNNs can be leveraged alongside physics-informed techniques with ease, significantly improving interpretability. This study introduces a novel flood GNN architecture, DUALFloodGNN, which embeds physical constraints at both global and local scales through explicit loss terms. The model jointly predicts water volume at nodes and flow along edges through a shared message-passing framework. To improve performance for autoregressive inference, model training is conducted with a multi-step loss enhanced with dynamic curriculum learning. Compared with standard GNN architectures and state-of-the-art GNN flood models, DUALFloodGNN achieves substantial improvements in predicting multiple hydrologic variables while maintaining high computational efficiency.

*Giacinto Paolo Saggese,Paul Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DataFlow is a computational framework for building, testing, and deploying machine learning systems on time-series data, ensuring batch-to-streaming consistency, strict causality, and flexible configuration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in transitioning machine learning systems from batch prototypes to production streaming systems, including causality violations and poor reproducibility.

Method: DataFlow utilizes a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time guarantees, enforcing causality and allowing flexibility through configuration without code changes.

Result: The framework automates tracking of knowledge time, prevents future-peeking bugs, supports batch and streaming consistency, integrates with Python tools, and proves effective across multiple domains.

Conclusion: DataFlow enhances consistency, reproducibility, and operational flexibility of machine learning systems in processing unbounded time-series data, bridging batch mode and streaming production seamlessly.

Abstract: We present DataFlow, a computational framework for building, testing, and deploying high-performance machine learning systems on unbounded time-series data. Traditional data science workflows assume finite datasets and require substantial reimplementation when moving from batch prototypes to streaming production systems. This gap introduces causality violations, batch boundary artifacts, and poor reproducibility of real-time failures.
  DataFlow resolves these issues through a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time idempotency: outputs at any time t depend only on a fixed-length context window preceding t. This guarantee ensures that models developed in batch mode execute identically in streaming production without code changes. The framework enforces strict causality by automatically tracking knowledge time across all transformations, eliminating future-peeking bugs.
  DataFlow supports flexible tiling across temporal and feature dimensions, allowing the same model to operate at different frequencies and memory profiles via configuration alone. It integrates natively with the Python data science stack and provides fit/predict semantics for online learning, caching and incremental computation, and automatic parallelization through DAG-based scheduling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across domains including financial trading, IoT, fraud detection, and real-time analytics.

### [257] [Information-Theoretic Quality Metric of Low-Dimensional Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23981)
*Sebastián Gutiérrez-Bernal,Hector Medel Cobaxin,Abiel Galindo González*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new metric, ERPM, to evaluate low-dimensional embeddings by focusing on information preservation, distinguishing it from classical distortion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical metrics for evaluating low-dimensional embeddings focus on distortions in distances or geometry, but they fail to assess information preservation explicitly.

Method: The paper develops the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a metric based on Shannon entropy and stable rank, to evaluate changes in uncertainty between high-dimensional and reduced representations.

Result: ERPM shows strong correlations with Local Procrustes but identifies neighborhoods with significant information loss, complementing existing metrics by offering a unique perspective on embeddings.

Conclusion: The ERPM metric is valuable for assessing information-sensitive applications like early-warning indicators, providing a more complete understanding of data embedding quality.

Abstract: In this work we study the quality of low-dimensional embeddings from an explicitly information-theoretic perspective. We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators.

TL;DR: CLEAR-HUG is a framework for improving ECG representation learning by capturing subtle heartbeat variations and adhering to clinical diagnostic guidelines, leading to a 6.84% performance improvement across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earlier eSSL methods fail to consider inherent variations between heartbeats due to cardiac conduction processes and neglect the sequential diagnostic principles in ECG analysis, creating a gap in representation learning.

Method: CLEAR-HUG consists of two stages: CLEAR, an eSSL model leveraging sparse attention to capture heartbeat-specific variations, and HUG, a hierarchical diagnostic approach reflecting clinical practices.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate a 6.84% improvement across six tasks, validating the framework's ability to enhance cardiac representation learning and diagnostic alignment.

Conclusion: CLEAR-HUG improves ECG analysis by addressing earlier eSSL limitations, capturing nuanced heartbeat variations, and aligning representation learning with clinical diagnostic guidelines.

Abstract: The multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) stands as a cornerstone of cardiac diagnosis. Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG. This highlights its ability to enhance representations of cardiac conduction and align patterns with expert diagnostic guidelines.

*Rui Chen,Junjun Guo,Hongbin Wang,Yan Xiang,Yantuan Xian,Zhengtao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperGRL, a framework for graph representation learning that avoids traditional complex architectures by employing innovative alignment and uniformity criteria to achieve superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior GRL methods rely heavily on contrastive objectives and mutual information maximization, which introduce complications like over-smoothing, over-squashing, and instability due to complex architectures and hyperparameter tuning.

Method: HyperGRL utilizes two objectives—neighbor-mean alignment for semantic stability and sampling-free uniformity via L2-based hyperspherical regularization—both regulated by an entropy-guided adaptive mechanism for training stability.

Result: HyperGRL achieves significant gains in node classification, clustering, and link prediction, outperforming existing methods by average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74%, respectively.

Conclusion: HyperGRL demonstrates the capability of geometrically grounded and sampling-free contrastive learning in improving graph representation quality and generalization.

Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) aims to encode structural and semantic dependencies of graph-structured data into low-dimensional embeddings. However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of geometrically grounded, sampling-free contrastive objectives for graph representation learning.

*Haoyue Bai,Yiyou Sun,Wenjie Hu,Shi Qiu,Maggie Ziyu Huan,Peiyang Song,Robert Nowak,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores why reinforcement learning tuning preserves LLM capabilities while supervised fine-tuning narrows them, introducing a granular benchmark to analyze reasoning skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand why reinforcement learning (RL) tuning preserves reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs) compared to the narrowing effects of supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Method: The authors develop a benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic skills like calculation and fact retrieval, combined with analyses of statistical patterns and meta-probing techniques during training.

Result: The study finds that RL-tuned models maintain stable behavioral profiles and reasoning skills, whereas SFT models show behavioral drift and overfitting to patterns.

Conclusion: RL-based tuning better preserves broad generalization and reasoning abilities in LLMs; the findings offer principles for training strategies to enhance generalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display strikingly different generalization behaviors: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often narrows capability, whereas reinforcement-learning (RL) tuning tends to preserve it. The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns. This work provides new insights into the nature of reasoning in LLMs and points toward principles for designing training strategies that foster broad, robust generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework for lane-change intention prediction combining deep temporal representations with physics-informed cues, and demonstrates effectiveness across diverse highway scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses challenges in autonomous driving and ADAS for predicting lane-change intentions amidst noisy data, class imbalances, and varying highway environments.

Method: The proposed method employs a Bi-LSTM encoder to learn temporal embeddings from trajectory histories, combines them with kinematic and safety features, and uses a LightGBM classifier with imbalance-aware optimization techniques.

Result: The framework achieves high macro-F1 scores on two datasets (highD and exiD), showing superior performance compared to standalone baselines in prediction horizons of 1, 2, and 3 seconds.

Conclusion: The integration of physics-informed features with deep learning-based temporal embeddings enhances robustness and reliability in predicting lane-change intentions for diverse traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Lane-change intention prediction is safety-critical for autonomous driving and ADAS, but remains difficult in naturalistic traffic due to noisy kinematics, severe class imbalance, and limited generalization across heterogeneous highway scenarios. We propose Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI), a hybrid framework that fuses deep temporal representations with physics-inspired interaction cues. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s. TPI-AI outperforms standalone LightGBM and Bi-LSTM baselines, achieving macro-F1 of 0.9562, 0.9124, 0.8345 on highD and 0.9247, 0.8197, 0.7605 on exiD at T = 1, 2, 3 s, respectively. These results show that combining physics-informed interaction features with learned temporal embeddings yields robust multi-scenario lane-change intention prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of latent autoregression in GP-VAE models and its impact on long-range structural stability and compatibility with Gaussian-process priors.

Method: The authors compare three models: the full GP-VAE with latent autoregression, a non-autoregressive version, and a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer.

Result: Latent autoregression improves long-horizon stability and latent trajectory compatibility with Gaussian-process priors, while its removal degrades latent structure and stability.

Conclusion: Latent autoregression effectively organizes long-range structure in GP-VAE models, complementing token-level autoregressive approaches.

Abstract: This paper provides an ablation-based analysis of latent autoregression in GP-VAE models, building upon our previous work introducing the architecture. Language models typically rely on an autoregressive factorization over tokens. In contrast, our prior work proposed shifting sequential structure to the latent space through a causal Gaussian process, while using a non-autoregressive decoder. Here, we conduct a systematic ablation study of the role played by latent autoregression. We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior. These findings highlight the role of latent autoregression as an effective mechanism for organizing long-range structure, while remaining complementary to token-level autoregressive modeling. They should be interpreted as an empirical analysis of representational structure rather than as a proposal for a new architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-critique approach for large language models (LLMs) to improve their own answers, significantly enhancing planning benchmarks in multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address previous doubts about the effectiveness of self-critique methods in LLMs and demonstrate their capabilities for intrinsic improvements in performance without external verification.

Method: The paper uses a few-shot learning technique, extends it to a many-shot approach, and employs an iterative correction and refinement process to allow self-critique to enhance planning performance.

Result: Self-critique led to significant performance gains on planning datasets such as Blocksworld, Logistics, and Mini-grid, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study establishes that intrinsic self-critique methods can substantially improve LLM performance in planning tasks, with potential for further advancements when integrated with stronger search techniques and advanced models.

Abstract: We demonstrate an approach for LLMs to critique their \emph{own} answers with the goal of enhancing their performance that leads to significant improvements over established planning benchmarks. Despite the findings of earlier research that has cast doubt on the effectiveness of LLMs leveraging self critique methods, we show significant performance gains on planning datasets in the Blocksworld domain through intrinsic self-critique, without external source such as a verifier. We also demonstrate similar improvements on Logistics and Mini-grid datasets, exceeding strong baseline accuracies. We employ a few-shot learning technique and progressively extend it to a many-shot approach as our base method and demonstrate that it is possible to gain substantial improvement on top of this already competitive approach by employing an iterative process for correction and refinement. We illustrate how self-critique can significantly boost planning performance. Our empirical results present new state-of-the-art on the class of models considered, namely LLM model checkpoints from October 2024. Our primary focus lies on the method itself, demonstrating intrinsic self-improvement capabilities that are applicable regardless of the specific model version, and we believe that applying our method to more complex search techniques and more capable models will lead to even better performance.

*Advait Gadhikar,Riccardo Grazzi,James Hensman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses outliers in LLMs weights and activations during quantization, introducing the rotation-based OptRot methods to enhance quantization effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outliers in weights and activations of LLMs complicate the quantization process, which is essential for efficient model deployment.

Method: The authors propose fusible rotation methods, primarily OptRot, which minimizes the element-wise fourth power of rotated weights to reduce outliers and optimize quantization error. They also introduce OptRot$^+$ to further refine performance using activation covariance.

Result: OptRot shows superior performance over baseline and competing methods for weight quantization, while also improving activation quantization in specific settings. However, it exhibits trade-offs when fully quantizing both weights and activations.

Conclusion: The proposed OptRot methods offer effective and principled solutions for addressing outliers in LLM quantization, but a balance between weight and activation quantization is necessary for optimal performance.

Abstract: The presence of outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) weights and activations makes them difficult to quantize. Recent work has leveraged rotations to mitigate these outliers. In this work, we propose methods that learn fusible rotations by minimizing principled and cheap proxy objectives to the weight quantization error. We primarily focus on GPTQ as the quantization method. Our main method is OptRot, which reduces weight outliers simply by minimizing the element-wise fourth power of the rotated weights. We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting. We also propose a data-dependent method, OptRot$^{+}$, that further improves performance by incorporating information on the activation covariance. In the W4A4 setting, we see that both OptRot and OptRot$^{+}$ perform worse, highlighting a trade-off between weight and activation quantization.

TL;DR: GARDO is a framework to fine-tune diffusion models using adaptive regularization and diversity-aware methods to overcome reward hacking and improve sample efficiency in text-to-image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in online RL fine-tuning for diffusion models, particularly the issues of reward hacking, sub-optimality of regularization, and lack of diversity in generated images.

Method: GARDO selectively penalizes uncertain samples, adapts regularization by periodically updating the reference model, and boosts rewards for high-quality, diverse samples to ensure balanced exploration and exploitation.

Result: Performed experiments show GARDO improves generation diversity, mitigates reward hacking, and maintains sample efficiency across various metrics, even on unseen evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: GARDO enhances the alignment and performance of text-to-image diffusion models while being robust and versatile. It addresses the key challenges in RL fine-tuning without compromising sample efficiency or diversity.

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves conditional coverage in conformal prediction by refining quantile regression using a novel surrogate objective, achieving better performance on experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving reliable conditional coverage in conformal prediction is challenging due to the limitations of finite samples and the impossibility of exact distribution-free conditional guarantees.

Method: The authors propose refining quantile regression via a density-weighted pinball loss derived from a Taylor expansion. They use a three-headed quantile network to estimate weights and fine-tune quantiles.

Result: The proposed method provides theoretical guarantees and significantly boosts conditional coverage performance on high-dimensional datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances conditional coverage in conformal prediction, offering improved theoretical guarantees and empirical effectiveness.

Abstract: While conformal prediction provides robust marginal coverage guarantees, achieving reliable conditional coverage for specific inputs remains challenging. Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile. We propose a three-headed quantile network that estimates these weights via finite differences using auxiliary quantile levels at \(1-α\pm δ\), subsequently fine-tuning the central quantile by optimizing the weighted loss. We provide a theoretical analysis with exact non-asymptotic guarantees characterizing the resulting excess risk. Extensive experiments on diverse high-dimensional real-world datasets demonstrate remarkable improvements in conditional coverage performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving provable stability in RL while balancing exploration and safety without complex reward engineering.

Method: MSACL uses multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning with exponential stability theory, enhancing policy optimization through stability-aware advantage functions and off-policy learning.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms across six benchmarks, ensuring exponential stability, rapid convergence, robustness to uncertainties, and generalization.

Conclusion: MSACL provides a significant advancement in safe RL, linking Lyapunov theory with actor-critic frameworks while maintaining simplicity in reward and control systems.

Abstract: Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $λ$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control. Source code and benchmark environments will be made publicly available.

*Wei Chen,Giacomo Dimarco,Lorenzo Pareschi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving uncertainty quantification (UQ) in plasma kinetic equations by developing a computationally efficient variance-reduced Monte Carlo method. This involves neural network surrogates and novel tensor-based models to handle high dimensionality and stiffness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification in plasma kinetic equations is crucial due to their sensitivity to small parameter variations, but existing methods are computationally expensive and struggle with high-dimensional and multiscale challenges.

Method: The authors propose a Monte Carlo framework integrated with neural network surrogates, particularly a generalization of separable physics-informed neural networks (SPINN), calibrated to improve efficiency and accuracy. The surrogate models use anisotropic micro-macro decomposition and match asymptotic properties of the VPL system.

Result: The framework significantly reduces variance, achieves accurate statistics with fewer high-fidelity samples, and decreases computational times, all while remaining robust in high stochastic dimensions.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for uncertainty quantification in plasma simulations, addressing key challenges such as computation cost and dimensionality, through innovative use of neural networks.

Abstract: Plasma kinetic equations exhibit pronounced sensitivity to microscopic perturbations in model parameters and data, making reliable and efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) essential for predictive simulations. However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of early sepsis detection methods for non-ward settings and leverage wearable technology for timely intervention.

Method: Four machine learning models were developed and optimized using genetic algorithms analyzing heart rate data. Models were tested for a one-hour prediction window, extended to four hours through transfer learning.

Result: Models showed promising results in early sepsis prediction, demonstrating feasibility for wearable implementation.

Conclusion: Wearable technology might enable effective early sepsis detection, significantly improving outcomes beyond ICU and ward environments.

Abstract: Sepsis, characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, results in significant mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs. The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring. The models were initially tailored for a prediction window of one hour, later extended to four hours through transfer learning. The encouraging outcomes of this study suggest the potential for wearable technology to facilitate early sepsis detection outside ICU and ward environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme for multi-modal beam prediction in UAV communications, addressing challenges like static weights and modal mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve beam prediction in UAV communications by addressing challenges like static weighting, modal mismatch, and weak cross-scenario generalization.

Method: Introduces SaM2B, a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction system, with reliability-aware dynamic weighting and cross-modal contrastive learning for adaptability and robustness.

Result: SaM2B outperforms baseline methods in experiments conducted on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SaM2B framework enhances performance and reliability in low-altitude UAV communications through adaptive weighting and improved cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly expanding driven by urban air mobility, logistics drones, and aerial sensing, while fast and accurate beam prediction in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications is crucial for achieving reliable connectivity. Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the "multi-source representation beam semantics" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Tubular Riemannian Laplace (TRL) approximation, a scalable method for Bayesian inference that adapts to neural network loss structures and provides highly calibrated results at a fraction of traditional training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of Euclidean Laplace approximations in high-dimensional, anisotropic, and curved loss surfaces of modern deep neural networks by proposing an adaptable Bayesian inference method.

Method: TRL models the posterior as a probabilistic tube in the low-loss valley, utilizing Fisher/Gauss-Newton metrics to differentiate tangential and transverse uncertainty and employing implicit curvature estimates.

Result: Empirical evaluations on ResNet-18 show TRL achieves excellent calibration and reliability, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles' Expected Calibration Error (ECE) with only 1/5 of the training cost.

Conclusion: TRL successfully combines the computational efficiency of single-model approaches with the reliability of ensemble methods, making it a practical solution for Bayesian neural networks.

Abstract: Laplace approximations are among the simplest and most practical methods for approximate Bayesian inference in neural networks, yet their Euclidean formulation struggles with the highly anisotropic, curved loss surfaces and large symmetry groups that characterize modern deep models. Recent work has proposed Riemannian and geometric Gaussian approximations to adapt to this structure. Building on these ideas, we introduce the Tubular Riemannian Laplace (TRL) approximation. TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty. We interpret TRL as a scalable reparametrised Gaussian approximation that utilizes implicit curvature estimates to operate in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost. TRL effectively bridges the gap between single-model efficiency and ensemble-grade reliability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViReLoc, a framework using visual reasoning for navigation and localization, avoiding text reliance and GPS dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning systems relying on text struggle with spatial tasks like navigation and geo-localization, which require visual and geometric understanding.

Method: The ViReLoc framework uses visual reasoning by learning spatial and geometric relations, employing reinforcement-based optimization, contrastive learning, and adaptive feature interaction to handle cross-view differences.

Result: ViReLoc shows improvements in spatial reasoning and cross-view retrieval accuracy across various navigation and localization scenarios.

Conclusion: Visual reasoning can complement navigation and localization tasks effectively, enabling secure solutions without relying on real-time GPS data.

Abstract: Multimodal intelligence development recently show strong progress in visual understanding and high level reasoning. Though, most reasoning system still reply on textual information as the main medium for inference. This limit their effectiveness in spatial tasks such as visual navigation and geo-localization. This work discuss about the potential scope of this field and eventually propose an idea visual reasoning paradigm Geo-Consistent Visual Planning, our introduced framework called Visual Reasoning for Localization, or ViReLoc, which performs planning and localization using only visual representations. The proposed framework learns spatial dependencies and geometric relations that text based reasoning often suffer to understand. By encoding step by step inference in the visual domain and optimizing with reinforcement based objectives, ViReLoc plans routes between two given ground images. The system also integrates contrastive learning and adaptive feature interaction to align cross view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences. Experiments across diverse navigation and localization scenarios show consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross view retrieval performance. These results establish visual reasoning as a strong complementary approach for navigation and localization, and show that such tasks can be performed without real time global positioning system data, leading to more secure navigation solutions.

*Lars van der Laan,Aurelien Bibaut,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semiparametric framework for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and dynamic discrete choice (DDC) models that combines statistical inference efficiency with flexible machine learning methods, overcoming issues of validity and restrictive assumptions in classical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between flexible machine learning methods in IRL that lack inferential guarantees and classical DDC models which impose parametric restrictions and computational challenges. The aim is to develop a framework that enables robust statistical inference while accommodating modern, nonparametric machine learning techniques.

Method: A semiparametric framework is introduced to derive efficient inference for reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. The method utilizes pseudo-reward properties of log-behavior policies to identify rewards and policy values, and derives smooth functionals and efficient influence functions for these targets. The approach employs debiased machine learning to nonparametrically estimate key components while ensuring statistical robustness.

Result: The framework achieves statistical properties such as √n-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency. It extends classical DDC inference to nonparametric settings, enabling computationally efficient and flexible analysis of reward-based decision-making behaviors.

Conclusion: This work unifies classical and modern approaches to statistical inference in IRL and DDC models, making it feasible to apply nonparametric methods and debiased machine learning for robust and efficient rewards analysis. The innovation offers practical computational solutions for a broad class of decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and dynamic discrete choice (DDC) models explain sequential decision-making by recovering reward functions that rationalize observed behavior. Flexible IRL methods typically rely on machine learning but provide no guarantees for valid inference, while classical DDC approaches impose restrictive parametric specifications and often require repeated dynamic programming. We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency. Our framework extends classical inference for DDC models to nonparametric rewards and modern machine-learning tools, providing a unified and computationally tractable approach to statistical inference in IRL.

*Akash Samanta,Sheldon Williamson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework to address instability and slow adaptation in dynamic environments by decomposing error signals into bias, noise, and alignment. This enhances learning in various domains like supervised optimization and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to solve issues in nonstationary and critical environments where learning systems face challenges like instability, slow convergence, and adaptation difficulties due to evolving learning dynamics.

Method: It proposes an error signal decomposition framework into bias, noise, and alignment components. These diagnostics are computed online and applied across supervised optimization, reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers.

Result: A stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer are derived. The framework also confirms stability under smoothness assumptions, with illustrated improvements in actor-critic learning.

Conclusion: This framework elevates the role of error evolution for adaptive learning, offering an interpretable and efficient method for achieving reliable learning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.

*Patrick Wyrod,Ashesh Chattopadhyay,Daniele Venturi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for forecasting chaotic systems by learning the joint probability distribution of system states over short temporal windows, with improved accuracy and forecasts reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic forecasting has limitations due to chaotic systems' sensitivity to initial conditions and unresolved multiscale processes. Generative models can provide probabilistic forecasts but often focus only on next-step predictions, neglecting the structure of dynamics.

Method: The authors reformulate forecasting as a generative problem by learning joint probability distributions over lagged system states instead of conditional predictions. They introduce a model-agnostic framework for training and inference, enabling assessment of robustness using uncertainty quantification metrics.

Result: The method demonstrates improved predictive skill, attractor geometry preservation, and better long-range statistical behaviour in chaotic systems like Lorenz-63 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, compared to conventional models.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust and accurate alternative for forecasting chaotic systems by emphasizing joint generative modeling and reliable uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems exhibit strong sensitivity to initial conditions and often contain unresolved multiscale processes, making deterministic forecasting fundamentally limited. Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for causal discovery using LLMs are heuristically integrated and lack strong theoretical foundations, highlighting the need for a rigorous and theoretical approach.

Method: The method leverages sheaf theory to model causal beliefs, proposes Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders, and employs Natural Gradient Descent for optimization within the belief manifold.

Result: The framework achieves competitive performance on causal discovery tasks involving 50-100 variables on both synthetic and real-world datasets, while unveiling foundational issues in latent variable projections.

Conclusion: HOLOGRAPH provides a mathematically rigorous framework for causal discovery, addresses hidden confounders, and demonstrates strong performance. Failures in the Locality axiom hint at fundamental challenges for large graphs.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data remains fundamentally limited by identifiability constraints. Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

Result: The proposed method showed improved reliability in small-scale experiments across 23 data recipes, ensuring results are more predictive of full-scale performance.

Conclusion: The use of reduced learning rates during proxy training enhances the reliability and accuracy of data recipe assessments for large-scale AI training.

Abstract: Data teams at frontier AI companies routinely train small proxy models to make critical decisions about pretraining data recipes for full-scale training runs. However, the community has a limited understanding of whether and when conclusions drawn from small-scale experiments reliably transfer to full-scale model training. In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of "fair" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training. We show that this approach yields relative performance that strongly correlates with that of fully tuned large-scale LLM pretraining runs. Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss. Empirically, we validate this approach across 23 data recipes covering four critical dimensions of data curation, demonstrating dramatic improvements in the reliability of small-scale experiments.

### [278] [From Perception to Punchline: Empowering VLM with the Art of In-the-wild Meme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24555)
*Xueyan Li,Yingyi Xue,Mengjie Jiang,Qingzi Zhu,Yazhe Niu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HUMOR, a framework for enhancing visual language models (VLMs) to generate humorous memes with hierarchical reasoning, subjective humor alignment, and higher quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of generating humorous memes requires nuanced understanding of visual content, context, and subjective humor, which standard image-to-caption methods struggle to address.

Method: HUMOR employs a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought approach for diverse reasoning paths, uses a pairwise reward model for subjective humor alignment, and optimizes group-wise reinforcement learning with theoretical guarantees for improvement.

Result: HUMOR improves VLMs by increasing reasoning diversity, aligning with human preferences more effectively, and producing higher-quality memes based on extensive experiments.

Conclusion: HUMOR provides a robust method for generating humorous memes and offers a general paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation tasks beyond memes through group-wise comparative judgment.

Abstract: Generating humorous memes is a challenging multimodal task that moves beyond direct image-to-caption supervision. It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality. Beyond memes, our work presents a general training paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation, where success is guided by comparative judgment within coherent output group.

### [279] [CPR: Causal Physiological Representation Learning for Robust ECG Analysis under Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24564)
*Shunbo Jia,Caizhi Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR) to enhance the robustness of ECG diagnosis models against adversarial perturbations. CPR separates pathological morphology from artifacts, achieving significant improvements in robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ECG diagnosis models, while accurate, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and exhibit reliance on spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features.

Method: The authors propose CPR, incorporating a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework, and utilize Structural Causal Models to separate pathological morphology from non-causal artifacts during ECG processing.

Result: On the PTB-XL dataset, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632 under Smooth Adversarial Perturbations, outperforming Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) and matching Randomized Smoothing's robustness with better inference efficiency.

Conclusion: CPR offers a robust, efficient, and clinically interpretable approach to defend against adversarial attacks in ECG diagnostics, balancing robustness, efficiency, and clinical practicality.

Abstract: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM), a hierarchical framework addressing inefficiencies in Large Language Models (LLMs) by reallocating computation to a compressed concept space and introducing novel scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with efficiently handling non-uniform information density, often over-computing predictable spans and under-prioritizing semantically critical parts.

Method: The proposed DLCM framework compresses tokens into concepts, reallocates computation for reasoning, introduces compression-aware scaling laws, and utilizes decoupled μP parametrization for stable training.

Result: At a compression setting of R=4, DLCM achieves a +2.69% average improvement across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.

Conclusion: DLCM effectively reallocates computation resources, improves reasoning efficiency, and achieves better performance in zero-shot benchmarks compared to traditional token-level models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) apply uniform computation to all tokens, despite language exhibiting highly non-uniform information density. This token-uniform regime wastes capacity on locally predictable spans while under-allocating computation to semantically critical transitions. We propose $\textbf{Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM)}$, a hierarchical language modeling framework that learns semantic boundaries from latent representations and shifts computation from tokens to a compressed concept space where reasoning is more efficient. DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior. We introduce the first $\textbf{compression-aware scaling law}$, which disentangles token-level capacity, concept-level reasoning capacity, and compression ratio, enabling principled compute allocation under fixed FLOPs. To stably train this heterogeneous architecture, we further develop a $\textbf{decoupled $μ$P parametrization}$ that supports zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across widths and compression regimes. At a practical setting ($R=4$, corresponding to an average of four tokens per concept), DLCM reallocates roughly one-third of inference compute into a higher-capacity reasoning backbone, achieving a $\textbf{+2.69$\%$ average improvement}$ across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.

*Zijian Zhao,Yitong Shang,Sen Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoFed, a Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) framework designed for traffic prediction, overcoming challenges like non-IID client data and hyper-parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic data privacy concerns and the limitations of traditional Federated Learning (FL), such as non-IID issues and hyper-parameter reliance, hinder efficient traffic prediction.

Method: AutoFed uses a federated representor with a client-aligned adapter to extract local client data into a shared global prompt matrix for personalized traffic prediction while preserving privacy.

Result: AutoFed demonstrates superior and consistent performance in traffic prediction across various real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: This work advances PFL for traffic prediction, offering a practical and privacy-preserving solution without manual hyper-parameter tuning, validated by strong experimental results.

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

*Malikussaid,Septian Caesar Floresko,Ade Romadhony,Isman Kurniawan,Warih Maharani,Hilal Hudan Nuha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fast and large-scale predictive model for logP prediction using a curated dataset of 426,850 bioactive compounds, achieving high performance metrics using ensemble models and novel computational techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide efficient and accurate methods for predicting lipophilicity (logP) to facilitate molecular design, addressing prior computational inefficiencies and model prediction limitations.

Method: The authors developed a byte-offset indexing computational infrastructure for data integration and applied robust ensemble modeling approaches, including Random Forest and XGBoost, while exploring stratified strategies for subset-specific predictions.

Result: Tree-based ensemble models achieved strong performance with an R-squared of 0.765 and optimal RMSE values despite dataset heteroskedasticity. Stratified modeling improved predictions specifically for drug-like and extreme-case molecules.

Conclusion: Well-curated descriptor-based ensemble models are shown to rival advanced neural network architectures in logP prediction, offering guidance for lipophilicity-related molecular design.

Abstract: This study presents a large-scale predictive modeling framework for logP prediction using 426850 bioactive compounds rigorously curated from the intersection of three authoritative chemical databases: PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules. We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures.

*Honglin Gao,Lan Zhao,Junhao Ren,Xiang Li,Gaoxi Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HeteroHBA, a novel generative backdoor attack framework for heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs), and demonstrates its capabilities in targeted poisoning attacks with stealth characteristics and improved success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the lack of exploration into backdoor poisoning attacks specifically targeting heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs), despite their wide applicability. The authors aim to assess the vulnerabilities of HGNNs and highlight potential security risks.

Method: The proposed method, HeteroHBA, utilizes saliency-based screening to select influential auxiliary neighbors for attaching triggers, synthesizes trigger features and connections to adapt to local heterogeneous contexts, applies adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) with MMD loss to reduce detectability, and employs a bilevel optimization objective for both attack success and clean performance retention.

Result: Empirical experiments on various heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that HeteroHBA consistently outperforms prior backdoor attack baselines by achieving higher attack success rates while having minimal impact on model accuracy for unaffected data.

Conclusion: The results show that HeteroHBA poses a tangible security threat to HGNNs, emphasizing the need for advanced defense mechanisms to safeguard against such backdoor attacks in graph learning.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved strong performance in many real-world applications, yet targeted backdoor poisoning on heterogeneous graphs remains less studied. We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of mobility in enhancing Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) performance, proposing a framework utilizing induced mobility to optimize sparse network connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFL suffers from performance degradation due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity, and user mobility in next-generation wireless networks could mitigate these issues.

Method: The paper theoretically and empirically evaluates the impact of user mobility on DFL and introduces a framework leveraging induced mobility patterns for enhanced data propagation.

Result: Findings show significant performance improvements via random user mobility and induced mobility patterns in sparse networks, validated through theoretical analysis and experiments.

Conclusion: User mobility, whether natural or induced, can substantially boost DFL performance by addressing sparse connectivity, data heterogeneity, and improving information flow in decentralized networks.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training among users without relying on a central server. However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel learning paradigm, Nested Learning (NL), to address challenges in continual learning, self-improvement, and effective solutions for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the fundamental challenges of continual learning, memory, and effective solutions within large language models, and provide a coherent learning paradigm.

Method: The Nested Learning approach includes: (1) expressive optimizers using memory modules, (2) self-modifying sequence models updating learning rules, and (3) a Continuum Memory System for enhanced memory capabilities.

Result: The proposed Hope module demonstrates effectiveness in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, few-shot generalization, long-context reasoning, and continual learning tasks.

Conclusion: Nested Learning provides insights into higher-order in-context learning and continual learning capabilities, showcasing promising results in advancing learning model designs and enabling more expressive learning algorithms.

Abstract: Despite the recent progresses, particularly in developing Language Models, there are fundamental challenges and unanswered questions about how such models can continually learn/memorize, self-improve, and find effective solutions. In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses causal discovery in linear Gaussian systems with mixed latent confounding, introducing a method called DCL-DECOR to separate and handle pervasive latent effects and localized dependence effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of identifying causal structures in data affected by mixed latent confounding, where global latent effects can be misidentified as causal edges and latent-variable graphical models yield limited outcomes.

Method: The proposed DCL-DECOR pipeline decomposes the precision matrix into structured and low-rank components, isolates pervasive latent effects, applies correlated-noise DAG learning to the deconfounded representation, and enforces bow-freeness through reconciliation.

Result: Identifiability results reveal recoverable causal targets under the mixed confounding model, and synthetic experiments showcase improved directed edge recovery compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper provides a modular approach with guarantees for causal discovery under mixed latent confounding, demonstrating consistent performance improvements in recovering causal structures.

Abstract: We study causal discovery from observational data in linear Gaussian systems affected by \emph{mixed latent confounding}, where some unobserved factors act broadly across many variables while others influence only small subsets. This setting is common in practice and poses a challenge for existing methods: differentiable and score-based DAG learners can misinterpret global latent effects as causal edges, while latent-variable graphical models recover only undirected structure.
  We propose \textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.
  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenge of negative transfer and resource-intensive auxiliary task selection in multi-task learning. It proposes BandiK, a three-stage method using multi-bandits for efficient auxiliary subset selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models face challenges in effectively transferring knowledge between tasks and avoiding negative transfer. Identifying beneficial auxiliary tasks is computationally demanding and varies across target tasks.

Method: BandiK uses a three-stage approach: estimating pairwise task transfers, constructing candidate auxiliary task sets to simplify complexity, and employing a Multi-Armed Bandit framework integrated into a novel multi-bandit structure.

Result: BandiK significantly reduces the computational challenges in auxiliary task selection by optimizing the process through a structured multi-bandit framework, ensuring efficient transfer evaluation and subset choice.

Conclusion: The paper introduces BandiK as a promising method for improving multi-task learning by addressing negative transfer and computational efficiency in auxiliary task selection.

Abstract: The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models. However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.
  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap of actual user behavior studies for operational autonomous vehicle services, instead of depending on hypothetical scenarios.

Method: A survey of 336 valid respondents was conducted using realistic service attributes, analyzed via Structural Equation Modeling with six latent psychological constructs.

Result: The study found that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest predictors of autonomous taxi adoption, alongside nuanced roles of other constructs.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical insights for policymaking, fare structuring, and public outreach to facilitate large-scale deployment of autonomous taxis.

Abstract: Autonomous taxi services represent a transformative advancement in urban mobility, offering safety, efficiency, and round-the-clock operations. While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings.

### [289] [Gradient Descent as Implicit EM in Distance-Based Neural Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24780)
*Alan Oursland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that neural network behaviors like probabilistic inference (soft clustering, prototype specialization, Bayesian uncertainty) stem directly from the log-sum-exp structure of objectives. Gradient descent inherently performs expectation-maximization, embedding inference into optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a direct mathematical explanation for probabilistic inference behaviors observed in neural networks, bypassing loose analogies and post-hoc architectural interpretations.

Method: The authors derive that for any objective with a log-sum-exp structure, gradients align with posterior responsibilities, signifying implicit expectation-maximization during optimization without relying on explicit inference algorithms.

Result: The derivation unifies learning under various regimes (mixture modeling, attention, and classification) via a single mechanism, showing that inference is embedded in optimization and directly tied to the geometry of objectives.

Conclusion: Neural networks, due to their objective structures, inherently integrate inference into optimization, eliminating the need for separate inference mechanisms. The observed Bayesian properties are not emergent but intrinsic to the optimization process.

Abstract: Neural networks trained with standard objectives exhibit behaviors characteristic of probabilistic inference: soft clustering, prototype specialization, and Bayesian uncertainty tracking. These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\partial L / \partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.

Conclusion: This framework significantly advances DTI predictions by integrating probabilistic modeling with confidence enrichment, enhancing prediction robustness and utility.

Abstract: Precise probabilistic information about drug-target interaction (DTI) predictions is vital for understanding limitations and boosting predictive performance. Gaussian processes (GP) offer a scalable framework to integrate state-of-the-art DTI representations and Bayesian inference, enabling novel operations, such as Bayesian classification with rejection, top-$K$ selection, and ranking. We propose a deep kernel learning-based GP architecture (DTI-GP), which incorporates a combined neural embedding module for chemical compounds and protein targets, and a GP module. The workflow continues with sampling from the predictive distribution to estimate a Bayesian precedence matrix, which is used in fast and accurate selection and ranking operations. DTI-GP outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, and it allows (1) the construction of a Bayesian accuracy-confidence enrichment score, (2) rejection schemes for improved enrichment, and (3) estimation and search for top-$K$ selections and ranking with high expected utility.

Method: The study proposes using Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update (OMWU) to achieve Nash equilibrium in NLHF, offering convergence guarantees without relying on the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium while investigating marginal convergence behavior.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows linear convergence rates under certain conditions, with experiments validating OMWU's advantages for tabular and neural policy classes.

Conclusion: OMWU provides a robust framework for aligning LLMs with complex human preferences, demonstrating exponential improvements in marginal convergence and broader applicability for LLM developments.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has proven effective for enhancing model capabilities, yet standard preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model assumes transitivity, overlooking the inherent complexity of human population preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results. Experiments corroborate the theoretical strengths of $\mathtt{OMWU}$ in both tabular and neural policy classes, demonstrating its potential for LLM applications.

### [292] [Discovering Coordinated Joint Options via Inter-Agent Relative Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24827)
*Raul D. Steleac,Mohan Sridharan,David Abel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for multi-agent option discovery aimed at improving coordination using joint-state abstraction and neural graph Laplacian estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of achieving coordinated behavior in multi-agent systems due to the exponential growth of the joint state space and the limitations of existing methods that often sacrifice coordination.

Method: The method involves using a joint-state abstraction to compress the state space while ensuring information for coordinated behavior is preserved. It builds on a representation termed the 'Fermat state' to measure team-level misalignment and employs a neural graph Laplacian estimator to capture state synchronisation patterns.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated stronger coordination capabilities in multi-agent domains compared to existing option discovery methods.

Conclusion: The outlined method provides a robust solution for discovering coordinated behaviors in multi-agent systems, significantly improving downstream coordination while overcoming limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.

*Linhao Fan,Hongqiang Fang,Jingyang Dai,Yong Jiang,Qixing Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents AODDiff, a probabilistic framework for reconstructing Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) fields using a diffusion-based Bayesian method. It achieves high-quality reconstruction while enabling uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in reconstructing AOD fields, including the limited availability of complete training data and the absence of uncertainty quantification in traditional models.

Method: The method involves AODDiff, which learns a spatiotemporal probability distribution from incomplete data using a corruption-aware training strategy. A decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy is applied to effectively guide the reconstruction process using heterogeneous constraints.

Result: Experiments show that AODDiff provides high accuracy and robustness in AOD reconstruction tasks like downscaling and inpainting while maintaining spatial spectral fidelity.

Conclusion: AODDiff is a robust and effective framework that adapts to various reconstruction tasks and offers uncertainty quantification, making it valuable for atmospheric monitoring.

Abstract: High-quality reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) fields is critical for Atmosphere monitoring, yet current models remain constrained by the scarcity of complete training data and a lack of uncertainty quantification.To address these limitations, we propose AODDiff, a probabilistic reconstruction framework based on diffusion-based Bayesian inference. By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications.

*András Millinghoffer,Bence Bolgár,Péter Antal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates transfer effects by modeling inductive performance using multi-task learning curves across varying sample sizes. It proposes an efficient method to approximate these curves for characterizing data-driven transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand transfer effects by focusing on perturbing the data set (adding samples), rather than adjusting the model through gradient updates, revealing a fundamental perspective on transfer effects.

Method: The authors model transfer effects quantitatively using multi-task learning curves, propose an efficient method akin to Task Affinity Grouping, and evaluate it on drug-target interaction data.

Result: Empirical results show that learning curves are effective at capturing multi-task learning transfer effects. The proposed multi-task extensions also highlight pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation models.

Conclusion: Learning curves offer a more fundamental and effective approach for modeling transfer effects, enabling better insights into data-driven aspects of multi-task learning and foundation models.

Abstract: Transfer effects manifest themselves both during training using a fixed data set and in inductive inference using accumulating data. We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability. Evaluations are performed using a benchmark drug-target interaction data set. Our results show that learning curves can better capture the effects of multi-task learning and their multi-task extensions can delineate pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation models.

*Zihao Chen,Alexandre Andre,Wenrui Ma,Ian Knight,Sergey Shuvaev,Eva Dyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRISM, a hierarchical forecasting model that uses a learnable tree-based partition to capture global and local features of real-world time series, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting is vital across domains like finance and healthcare, but remains difficult due to time series data having complex structures such as global trends and localized dynamics.

Method: The proposed PRISM method employs a tree-based structure to recursively partition the signal, extracting scale-specific features using time-frequency basis projections, and aggregates them for multivariate time series forecasting.

Result: PRISM outperformed state-of-the-art forecasting methods on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its ability to capture both global structure and local dynamics effectively.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach of PRISM offers a lightweight and flexible solution for forecasting, advancing the capabilities in handling multivariate time series.

Abstract: Forecasting is critical in areas such as finance, biology, and healthcare. Despite the progress in the field, making accurate forecasts remains challenging because real-world time series contain both global trends, local fine-grained structure, and features on multiple scales in between. Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve cognitive task classification by integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, addressing the need to model complex connectivity patterns in brain data more effectively.

Method: The method involves using a graph neural network model (GNN) called SpectralBrainGNN, which employs spectral convolution based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) using normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition.

Result: The SpectralBrainGNN model achieved a classification accuracy of 96.25% on the Human Connectome Project-Task dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in decoding brain states.

Conclusion: SpectralBrainGNN provides advancements in modeling brain connectivity for cognitive tasks using spectral graph neural networks, and its open-source implementation supports reproducibility and future work.

Abstract: Cognitive task classification using machine learning plays a central role in decoding brain states from neuroimaging data. By integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, complex connectivity patterns can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomes. This process transforms raw blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals into interpretable representations of cognitive processes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) further advance this paradigm by modeling brain regions as nodes and functional connections as edges, capturing topological dependencies and multi-scale interactions that are often missed by conventional approaches. Our proposed SpectralBrainGNN model, a spectral convolution framework based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) computed via normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project-Task (HCPTask) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.25\%.

*Xinyang Chen,Amaël Broustet,Guoting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), a novel graph filtration method enhancing topology awareness in graph analysis and graph classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing persistent homology methods rely on limited filtrations, restricting expressive power for graph topology representation and analysis.

Method: The approach introduces FSF derived from frequent subgraphs, creating frequency-based persistent homology features, coupled with FPH-based machine learning models and hybrid graph classification frameworks integrating graph neural networks.

Result: FPH-ML shows competitive/superior accuracy against other existing methods; FPH-GNN yields performance improvements from 0.4-21% in various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating FSF in graph analysis bridges frequent subgraph mining with topological data analysis, significantly enhancing expressive capability and graph representation learning.

Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.

*András Antos,András Millinghoffer,Péter Antal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL) for evaluating contributions and selecting optimal partners in AI and ML problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI problems with asymmetric and computationally heavy processes require efficient methods to evaluate partners' contributions for better collaboration.

Method: The authors propose a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), and develop a generalized GapE algorithm.

Result: New exponential error bounds are derived, improving best-arm identification, with sample-complexity gains due to shared evaluations.

Conclusion: This framework aids sequential learning in identifying efficient support networks, with broad applications like MTL, ATL, federated learning, and multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Many modern AI and ML problems require evaluating partners' contributions through shared yet asymmetric, computationally intensive processes and the simultaneous selection of the most beneficial candidates. Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.
  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.
  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).

*Cristina P. Martin-Linares,Jonathan P. Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method called Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs) to address redundancies and inconsistent features in sparse autoencoders (SAEs), resulting in consistently reusable and interpretable features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve SAEs by addressing their issues with redundant and inconsistent features, making learned features more interpretable and transferable.

Method: The method involves training a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core and iteratively refining it through a gradient X activation-based feature attribution metric to select a compact subset of useful features. Only the encoder core weight vectors are retained across cycles.

Result: Using seven cycles of distillation on model activations, the approach distilled a core with 197 consistent features. This distilled core showed improved performance on several evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: DMSAEs enable the creation of consistently reusable sets of latent features, improving the interpretability and transferability of SAEs across different sparsity levels.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) aim to disentangle model activations into monosemantic, human-interpretable features. In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels

### [300] [Many Minds from One Model: Bayesian Transformers for Population Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25063)
*Diji Yang,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which allow for generating diverse yet coherent model behaviors from pre-trained weights using a Bayesian-inspired approach, improving exploration, diversity, and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current transformers being trained as deterministic systems and explore the benefits of incorporating population-level decision-making inspired by collective intelligence.

Method: B-Trans uses a Gaussian variational approximation in normalization layer biases to create stochastic variables, enabling sampling of diverse model instances without full Bayesian network training. It enforces temporal consistency by freezing sampled noise at the sequence level.

Result: B-Trans generates diverse yet competent model instances that improve exploration. Experiments show enhanced semantic diversity and better performance in zero-shot generation, RLVR, and RL without explicit labels compared to standard models.

Conclusion: B-Trans demonstrates the advantage of population-level decision-making in transforming pre-trained models into probabilistic systems, combining the benefits of diversity and coherence for better outcomes.

Abstract: Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.
  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.

### [301] [Efficiently Estimating Data Efficiency for Language Model Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24991)
*Gyung Hyun Je,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to predict data efficiency for fine-tuning LLMs, presenting an approach that significantly reduces annotation efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often require fine-tuning, but the unknown data efficiency for tasks leads to costly processes. The research aims to predict data efficiency and reduce unnecessary annotations.

Method: The authors introduced a metric to quantify data efficiency and proposed a method leveraging gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency with minimal labeled samples.

Result: Their approach achieved an 8.6% error in data efficiency prediction and eliminated hundreds of unnecessary annotations across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: Accurate prediction of data efficiency is achievable, enabling efficient fine-tuning of LLMs while minimizing annotation costs.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable zero-shot capability across many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is a common practice to improve their performance. However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task. Our experiment results and implementation code are available on GitHub.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for more accurate reasoning under uncertainty in high-stakes decision-making and effective forecasting tools.

Method: They generate training data from news events using an automated curation process, train the Qwen3 model on the OpenForesight dataset, and introduce improved techniques in retrieval and reward functions within RL.

Result: The OpenForecaster 8B model matches the performance of much larger proprietary models while showing improved accuracy, consistency, and calibration in predictions.

Conclusion: OpenForecaster 8B demonstrates that forecasting-specific training and open-sourced tools can achieve high-quality predictions and encourage further research in forecasting with open datasets.

Abstract: High-stakes decision making involves reasoning under uncertainty about the future. In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.

### [303] [Diffusion Language Models are Provably Optimal Parallel Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25014)
*Haozhe Jiang,Nika Haghtalab,Lijie Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) can perform parallel sampling efficiently with an optimal number of sequential steps when combined with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, while advocating for the inclusion of revision mechanisms to improve space complexity and expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to provide a deeper theoretical understanding of the efficiency and flexibility of Diffusion Language Models for parallel token generation, aiming to optimize their design for enhanced inference speed and utility.

Method: The authors formalized a model for parallel sampling, analyzed the sequential efficiency of DLMs with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT), and proposed adding remasking or revision capabilities to improve space efficiency and expressivity.

Result: DLMs, paired with CoT, can simulate parallel sampling algorithms using an optimal number of sequential steps. Adding revision or remasking capabilities further enables optimal space complexity and improves expressivity.

Conclusion: Diffusion Language Models, enhanced with revision or remasking, are theoretically strong candidates for efficient parallel sampling, offering benefits in both space and sequential step efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models for faster inference via parallel token generation. We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.

*Timo Kaufmann,Yannick Metz,Daniel Keim,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ResponseRank, a method to infer preference strength in binary choice scenarios using relative differences in proxy signals to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary choices in reinforcement learning lack information about the strength of preference, which is vital for generalization and decision-making.

Method: ResponseRank identifies relative differences in noisy proxy signals locally within strata for robust preference strength ranking and utility inference.

Result: ResponseRank demonstrated improved sample efficiency and robustness in synthetic, language modeling, and RL control tasks, and introduced a novel metric for cardinal utility learning.

Conclusion: ResponseRank effectively learns and ranks preference strength from noisy signals, contributing to more reliable reinforcement learning models.

Abstract: Binary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that architectures with either uniform or learnable attention derive the same modular addition algorithm, revealing topological and geometric equivalences via group manifold analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether different architectural designs (uniform vs. learnable attention) lead to distinct algorithms for modular addition, as previously hypothesized.

Method: The authors analyze learned representations by identifying and treating groups of neurons collectively as manifolds, leveraging tools from topology to uncover patterns across multiple circuits.

Result: Uniform and learnable attention architectures are shown to implement equivalent modular addition algorithms, verified through a statistical and topological study of learned representations.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that architectural variations in attention mechanisms do not lead to fundamentally distinct modular addition computations but share equivalent underlying structures.

Abstract: The Clock and Pizza interpretations, associated with architectures differing in either uniform or learnable attention, were introduced to argue that different architectural designs can yield distinct circuits for modular addition. In this work, we show that this is not the case, and that both uniform attention and trainable attention architectures implement the same algorithm via topologically and geometrically equivalent representations. Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology. Based on this insight, we can statistically analyze the learned representations across hundreds of circuits to demonstrate the similarity between learned modular addition circuits that arise naturally from common deep learning paradigms.

*Charles Oriioma,Josef Krivan,Rujeena Mathema,Pedro G. Lind,Alexander Szorkovszky,Shailendra Bhandari*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive method using Markovian approximation to optimize thresholds for saccade and fixation classification in eye-gaze experiments, achieving high accuracy and noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Saccade and fixation detection often uses fixed thresholds, which fails to account for variability between tasks and individuals, potentially biasing research outcomes.

Method: The authors propose an adaptive threshold optimization technique based on Markov states that minimizes transitions between fixations and saccades, evaluating it across velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion algorithms.

Result: Velocity thresholds provide good baseline accuracy (90-93%) but degrade under noise, while adaptive dispersion thresholds remain robust with accuracy above 81% under extreme noise.

Conclusion: Adaptive thresholding via K-ratio improves classification performance, offering practical guidelines for selecting optimal eye-gaze analysis methods under varying data quality and priorities.

Abstract: Properties of ocular fixations and saccades are highly stochastic during many experimental tasks, and their statistics are often used as proxies for various aspects of cognition. Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive method based on a Markovian approximation of eye-gaze dynamics, using saccades and fixations as states such that the optimal threshold minimizes state transitions. Applying this to three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion), we evaluate the overall accuracy against a multi-threshold benchmark as well as robustness to noise. We find that a velocity threshold achieves the highest baseline accuracy (90-93\%) across both free-viewing and visual search tasks. However, velocity-based methods degrade rapidly under noise when thresholds remain fixed, with accuracy falling below 20% at high noise levels. Adaptive threshold optimization via K-ratio minimization substantially improves performance under noisy conditions for all algorithms. Adaptive dispersion thresholds demonstrate superior noise robustness, maintaining accuracy above 81% even at extreme noise levels (σ = 50 px), though a precision-recall trade-off emerges that favors fixation detection at the expense of saccade identification. In addition to demonstrating our parsimonious adaptive thresholding method, these findings provide practical guidance for selecting and tuning classification algorithms based on data quality and analytical priorities.

### [307] [Decoupling Constraint from Two Direction in Evolutionary Constrained Multi-objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23945)
*Ruiqing Sun,Dawei Feng,Xing Zhou,Lianghao Li,Sheng Qi,Bo Ding,Yijie Wang,Rui Wang,Huaimin Wang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DCF2D algorithm for improving performance in solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems by leveraging constraint coupling analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms fail to effectively utilize the coupling between constraints in solving CMOPs, leading to suboptimal results and poor interpretability.

Method: DCF2D identifies and leverages constraint interactions, employs auxiliary populations for relevant constraints, and uses directional search methods to optimize solutions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DCF2D outperforms five state-of-the-art CMOEAs on benchmark and real-world CMOP problems.

Conclusion: DCF2D effectively addresses the coupling between constraints in CMOPs, enhancing the efficiency and quality of optimization solutions.

Abstract: Real-world Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problems (CMOPs) often contain multiple constraints, and understanding and utilizing the coupling between these constraints is crucial for solving CMOPs. However, existing Constrained Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (CMOEAs) typically ignore these couplings and treat all constraints as a single aggregate, which lacks interpretability regarding the specific geometric roles of constraints. To address this limitation, we first analyze how different constraints interact and show that the final Constrained Pareto Front (CPF) depends not only on the Pareto fronts of individual constraints but also on the boundaries of infeasible regions. This insight implies that CMOPs with different coupling types must be solved from different search directions. Accordingly, we propose a novel algorithm named Decoupling Constraint from Two Directions (DCF2D). This method periodically detects constraint couplings and spawns an auxiliary population for each relevant constraint with an appropriate search direction. Extensive experiments on seven challenging CMOP benchmark suites and on a collection of real-world CMOPs demonstrate that DCF2D outperforms five state-of-the-art CMOEAs, including existing decoupling-based methods.

Abstract: Simulation optimization (SO) is frequently challenged by noisy evaluations, high computational costs, and complex, multimodal search landscapes. This paper introduces Tabu-Enhanced Simulation Optimization (TESO), a novel metaheuristic framework integrating adaptive search with memory-based strategies. TESO leverages a short-term Tabu List to prevent cycling and encourage diversification, and a long-term Elite Memory to guide intensification by perturbing high-performing solutions. An aspiration criterion allows overriding tabu restrictions for exceptional candidates. This combination facilitates a dynamic balance between exploration and exploitation in stochastic environments. We demonstrate TESO's effectiveness and reliability using an queue optimization problem, showing improved performance compared to benchmarks and validating the contribution of its memory components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical acceleration methods like Aitken's delta-squared and Wynn epsilon do not generalize well to diverse transport problems, motivating the search for novel techniques tailored to specific convergence patterns.

Method: The authors use genetic programming to evolve mathematical formulas specifically designed for improving SN convergence characteristics in neutron transport solutions.

Result: The new accelerator demonstrated over 75% success in enhancing convergence, nearly doubling the efficiency compared to traditional methods for the evaluated problem set.

Conclusion: This work illustrates the promise of genetic programming in discovering novel computational physics methods, particularly in advancing techniques for neutron transport problems.

Abstract: We present a genetic programming approach to automatically discover convergence acceleration methods for discrete ordinates solutions of neutron transport problems in slab geometry. Classical acceleration methods such as Aitken's delta-squared and Wynn epsilon assume specific convergence patterns and do not generalize well to the broad set of transport problems encountered in practice. We evolved mathematical formulas specifically tailored to SN convergence characteristics in this work. The discovered accelerator, featuring second differences and cross-product terms, achieved over 75 percent success rate in improving convergence compared to raw sequences - almost double that observed for classical techniques for the problem set considered.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile the hippocampus's seemingly distinct roles in memory retrieval and spatial navigation and identify a unifying computational principle.

Method: Analyzing two algorithms: personalized page-rank for memory retrieval and successor representations for planning, revealing their shared algorithmic basis.

Result: These two algorithms are found to be isomorphic, both relying on the stationary distribution of a random walk on a graph.

Conclusion: The hippocampus's core computational role may be computing this shared graph-based representation, unifying its functions.

Abstract: The hippocampus appears to implement two core but highly distinct functions in the brain: long term memory retrieval and planning and spatial navigation. Naively, these functions appear very different algorithmically. In this short note, we demonstrate that two powerful algorithms that have each independently been proposed to underlie the hippocampal operation for each function -- personalized page-rank for memory retrieval, and successor representations for planning and navigation, are in fact isomorphic and utilize the same underlying representation -- the stationary distribution of a random walk on a graph. We hypothesize that the core computational function of the hippocampus is to compute this representation on arbitrary input graphs.

### [311] [Enforcing Temporal Constraints for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23738)
*Adharsh Kamath,Sishen Zhang,Calvin Xu,Shubham Ugare,Gagandeep Singh,Sasa Misailovic*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Agent-C is a framework ensuring LLM-based agents adhere to temporal safety properties during application deployment, improving reliability and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical applications require stricter guardrails for temporal safety policies to prevent violations like accessing sensitive data before authentication, which current systems fail to address effectively.

Method: Agent-C introduces a DSL for temporal safety properties, transforms them into first-order logic, and employs SMT solving for conforming token generation, while providing alternatives to non-compliant actions.

Result: Agent-C achieves 100% conformance and harm prevention, enhancing utility across diverse applications and models, outperforming state-of-the-art guardrails.

Conclusion: Agent-C represents a significant advancement in ensuring temporal safety for LLM agents, setting new standards for reliability and task utility in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are deployed in safety-critical applications, yet current guardrail systems fail to prevent violations of temporal safety policies, requirements that govern the ordering and sequencing of agent actions. For instance, agents may access sensitive data before authenticating users or process refunds to unauthorized payment methods, violations that require reasoning about sequences of action rather than an individual action. Existing guardrails rely on imprecise natural language instructions or post-hoc monitoring, and provide no formal guarantees that agents will satisfy temporal constraints. We present Agent-C, a novel framework that provides run-time guarantees ensuring LLM agents adhere to formal temporal safety properties. Agent-C introduces a domain-specific language for expressing temporal properties (e.g., authenticate before accessing data), translates specifications to first-order logic, and uses SMT solving to detect non-compliant agent actions during token generation. When the LLM attempts to generate a non-compliant tool call, Agent-C leverages constrained generation techniques to ensure that every action generated by the LLM complies with the specification, and to generate a compliant alternative to a non-compliant agent action. We evaluate Agent-C across two real-world applications: retail customer service and airline ticket reservation system, and multiple language models (open and closed-source). Our results demonstrate that Agent-C achieves perfect safety (100% conformance, 0% harm), while improving task utility compared to state-of-the-art guardrails and unrestricted agents. On SoTA closed-source models, Agent-C improves conformance (77.4% to 100% for Claude Sonnet 4.5 and 83.7% to 100% for GPT-5), while simultaneously increasing utility (71.8% to 75.2% and 66.1% to 70.6%, respectively), representing a new SoTA frontier for reliable agentic reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current probabilistic programming languages lack the flexibility to experiment with novel model representations and mixed discrete-continuous models due to their tight coupling with specific inference algorithms.

Method: The authors propose a universal factor abstraction consisting of five fundamental operations that enable manipulation of probabilistic factors agnostic to their representation.

Result: This framework allows users to mix different model representations (e.g., discrete tables, Gaussian distributions) within a unified framework for practical inference in complex hybrid models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach overcomes the limitations of current probabilistic programming tools, enabling representation-agnostic programming to handle more complex models.

Abstract: Current probabilistic programming languages and tools tightly couple model representations with specific inference algorithms, preventing experimentation with novel representations or mixed discrete-continuous models. We introduce a factor abstraction with five fundamental operations that serve as a universal interface for manipulating factors regardless of their underlying representation. This enables representation-agnostic probabilistic programming where users can freely mix different representations (e.g. discrete tables, Gaussians distributions, sample-based approaches) within a single unified framework, allowing practical inference in complex hybrid models that current toolkits cannot adequately express.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a memory management system that is efficient and adaptable to both resource-constrained devices and high-performance parallel architectures.

Method: VGC employs a dual-layer architecture with Active VGC for runtime memory management using a concurrent mark-sweep technique, and Passive VGC for compile-time static object allocation optimization.

Result: Reduces pause times by up to 30% in multithreaded environments, decreases total memory usage by up to 25%, and ensures predictable memory access and scalability.

Conclusion: VGC successfully integrates runtime and compile-time optimizations, offering a robust memory management solution suitable for various programming environments.

Abstract: The Virtual Garbage Collector (VGC) introduces a novel memory management framework designed to optimize performance across diverse systems, ranging from resource constrained embedded devices to high performance parallel architectures. Unlike conventional garbage collectors, VGC employs a dual layer architecture consisting of Active VGC and Passive VGC to enable efficient, low overhead memory management. Active VGC dynamically manages runtime objects using a concurrent mark and sweep strategy tailored for parallel workloads, reducing pause times by up to 30 percent compared to generational collectors in multithreaded benchmarks. Passive VGC operates at compile time and optimizes static object allocation through predictive memory mapping, minimizing fragmentation by aligning objects to cache boundaries. This separation of responsibilities ensures predictable memory access patterns, reduces total memory usage by up to 25 percent, and improves scalability for modern parallel applications. By integrating compile time and runtime optimizations, VGC provides a robust and adaptable solution for memory intensive systems across both low level and high level programming environments.

*A. R. Balasubramanian,Mohammad Hossein Khoshechin Jorshari,Rupak Majumdar,Umang Mathur,Minjian Zhang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a poly-time unbiased estimator using a Monte Carlo approach to estimate Mazurkiewicz trace equivalence classes in concurrent programs, aiming to guide model checking efforts efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of estimating the number of Mazurkiewicz trace-equivalence classes in bounded concurrent programs, a critical factor for understanding model checking duration and search space coverage.

Method: The authors transformed an optimal DPOR algorithm into a bounded-depth, bounded-width tree representation. They used Knuth's classical estimator for unbiased estimation, combined with stochastic enumeration to manage variance.

Result: The proposed estimator implemented in the JMC model checker achieved robust results, producing stable estimates within a 20% accuracy band for test cases with state spaces containing up to $10^6$ classes.

Conclusion: This study presents the first provable poly-time unbiased estimators for counting traces in concurrent programs, significantly aiding resource allocation for model checking.

Abstract: We study the estimation problem for concurrent programs: given a bounded program $P$, estimate the number of Mazurkiewicz trace-equivalence classes induced by its interleavings. This quantity informs two practical questions for enumeration-based model checking: how long a model checking run is likely to take, and what fraction of the search space has been covered so far. We first show the counting problem is #P-hard even for restricted programs and, unless $P=NP$, inapproximable within any subexponential factor, ruling out efficient exact or randomized approximation algorithms. We give a Monte Carlo approach to obtain a poly-time unbiased estimator: we convert a stateless optimal DPOR algorithm into an unbiased estimator by viewing its exploration as a bounded-depth, bounded-width tree whose leaves are the maximal Mazurkiewicz traces. A classical estimator by Knuth, when run on this tree, yields an unbiased estimate. To control the variance, we apply stochastic enumeration by maintaining a small population of partial paths per depth whose evolution is coupled. We have implemented our estimator in the JMC model checker and evaluated it on shared-memory benchmarks. With modest budgets, our estimator yields stable estimates, typically within a 20% band, within a few hundred trials, even when the state space has $10^5$--$10^6$ classes. We also show how the same machinery estimates model-checking cost by weighting all explored graphs, not only complete traces. Our algorithms provide the first provable poly-time unbiased estimators for counting traces, a problem of considerable importance when allocating model checking resources.

### [315] [Simultaneous Extrinsic Contact and In-Hand Pose Estimation via Distributed Tactile Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23856)
*Mark Van der Merwe,Kei Ota,Dmitry Berenson,Nima Fazeli,Devesh K. Jha*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to enhance in-hand object pose and contact estimation for autonomous prehensile manipulation using tactile sensors and physical constraints, formalized as a factor graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in achieving accurate pose and contact estimation during tasks like autonomous assembly or tool use, especially due to tactile sensors providing local but ambiguous information and vision systems being affected by noise and occlusion.

Method: By combining tactile sensing observations with physical constraints, this work formalizes the problem as a factor graph, ensuring local consistency with tactile data and enforcing kinematic and force constraints for rigid body interactions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that this method outperforms current geometric and contact-informed pipelines, particularly when relying solely on tactile data.

Conclusion: The approach offers an effective solution to improve pose and contact estimation accuracy through integration of tactile data and physical constraints, enabling better autonomous manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Prehensile autonomous manipulation, such as peg insertion, tool use, or assembly, require precise in-hand understanding of the object pose and the extrinsic contacts made during interactions. Providing accurate estimation of pose and contacts is challenging. Tactile sensors can provide local geometry at the sensor and force information about the grasp, but the locality of sensing means resolving poses and contacts from tactile alone is often an ill-posed problem, as multiple configurations can be consistent with the observations. Adding visual feedback can help resolve ambiguities, but can suffer from noise and occlusions. In this work, we propose a method that pairs local observations from sensing with the physical constraints of contact. We propose a set of factors that ensure local consistency with tactile observations as well as enforcing physical plausibility, namely, that the estimated pose and contacts must respect the kinematic and force constraints of quasi-static rigid body interactions. We formalize our problem as a factor graph, allowing for efficient estimation. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing geometric and contact-informed estimation pipelines, especially when only tactile information is available.

*Guo Ye,Zexi Zhang,Xu Zhao,Shang Wu,Haoran Lu,Shihan Lu,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamTacVLA integrates tactile sensing with Vision-Language-Action models to enable superior performance in contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks, achieving up to 95% success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models are unable to effectively handle contact-rich tasks because they lack tactile sensing and struggle to interpret contact dynamics like force and texture.

Method: DreamTacVLA employs high-resolution tactile images, multi-scale sensory streams, hierarchical spatial alignment loss, and a tactile world model to predict future tactile states. It uses both digital and real-world data to train a system that understands contact physics.

Result: DreamTacVLA outperforms conventional VLA models in contact-rich manipulation tasks by achieving superior performance metrics, notably up to 95% success.

Conclusion: Incorporating tactile sensing into VLA models enables a nuanced understanding of contact dynamics, improving robustness and success in physical manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable generalization by mapping web-scale knowledge to robotic control, yet they remain blind to physical contact. Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.

*Liangtao Feng,Zhenchang Liu,Feng Zhang,Xuefeng Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHIELD, a method to enhance LiDAR-based UAV exploration through efficient hybrid frontier integration using spherical projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in UAV LiDAR exploration, such as computational burden, inconsistent point-cloud quality, and difficulty in classifying free space in regions without point clouds.

Method: SHIELD employs an observation-quality occupancy map, ray-casting to improve point-cloud quality issues, a hybrid frontier method to reduce computational load, and a spherical-projection ray-casting strategy for safety and efficiency.

Result: Simulations and flight experiments demonstrate the efficacy of SHIELD in overcoming the limitations of traditional UAV LiDAR exploration.

Conclusion: SHIELD is proven to enhance LiDAR-based drone exploration and will be open-sourced for the research community.

Abstract: This paper introduces SHIELD, a Spherical-Projection Hybrid-Frontier Integration for Efficient LiDAR-based Drone exploration method. Although laser LiDAR offers the advantage of a wide field of view, its application in UAV exploration still faces several challenges. The observation quality of LiDAR point clouds is generally inferior to that of depth cameras. Traditional frontier methods based on known and unknown regions impose a heavy computational burden, especially when handling the wide field of view of LiDAR. In addition, regions without point cloud are also difficult to classify as free space through raycasting. To address these problems, the SHIELD is proposed. It maintains an observation-quality occupancy map and performs ray-casting on this map to address the issue of inconsistent point-cloud quality during exploration. A hybrid frontier method is used to tackle both the computational burden and the limitations of point-cloud quality exploration. In addition, an outward spherical-projection ray-casting strategy is proposed to jointly ensure flight safety and exploration efficiency in open areas. Simulations and flight experiments prove the effectiveness of SHIELD. This work will be open-sourced to contribute to the research community.

TL;DR: This paper studies how dual-agency in robots, combining both autonomy and operator control, affects user experiences and perceptions, based on evaluations of a prototype system in task scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how the combination of a robot's autonomous capabilities and operator-mediated agency affects user interaction, particularly in a dual-agency context.

Method: The authors formalized the dual-agency as a User-Robot-Operator triad. They developed a prototype combining natural-language chat and freehand sketch annotations. The system was tested under three operating modes during fetch-and-carry tasks using a domestic mobile manipulator in a controlled environment.

Result: The study revealed mode-dependent differences in user-rated affinity and perceptions of security. Switching or blending of agency within one robot significantly influences user impressions and interaction experiences.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of agency design in human-robot interaction and provide empirical insights for developing human-in-the-loop robotic systems for domestic tasks.

Abstract: A single service robot can present two distinct agencies: its onboard autonomy and an operator-mediated agency, yet users experience them through one physical body. We formalize this dual-agency structure as a User-Robot-Operator triad in an autonomous remote-control setting that combines autonomous execution with remote human support. Prior to the recent surge of language-based and multimodal interfaces, we developed and evaluated an early-stage prototype in 2020 that combined natural-language text chat with freehand sketch annotations over the robot's live camera view to support remote intervention. We evaluated three modes - autonomous, remote, and hybrid - in controlled fetch-and-carry tasks using a domestic mobile manipulator (HSR) on a World Robot Summit 2020 rule-compliant test field. The results show systematic mode-dependent differences in user-rated affinity and additional insights on perceived security, indicating that switching or blending agency within one robot measurably shapes human impressions. These findings provide empirical guidance for designing human-in-the-loop mobile manipulation in domestic physical tasks.

Result: A customizable, high-fidelity simulation platform has been developed and released, enabling realistic UAV traffic scenario modeling and advanced research capabilities.

Conclusion: This platform addresses gaps in low-altitude UAV traffic simulation by offering a rich, flexible, and open-source tool for research and testing purposes.

Abstract: Significant challenges are posed by simulation and testing in the field of low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) traffic due to the high costs associated with large-scale UAV testing and the complexity of establishing low-altitude traffic test scenarios. Stringent safety requirements make high fidelity one of the key metrics for simulation platforms. Despite advancements in simulation platforms for low-altitude UAVs, there is still a shortage of platforms that feature rich traffic scenarios, high-precision UAV and scenario simulators, and comprehensive testing capabilities for low-altitude traffic. Therefore, this paper introduces an integrated high-fidelity simulation platform for low-altitude UAV traffic. This platform simulates all components of the UAV traffic network, including the control system, the traffic management system, the UAV system, the communication network , the anomaly and fault modules, etc. Furthermore, it integrates RflySim/AirSim and Unreal Engine 5 to develop full-state models of UAVs and 3D maps that model the real world using the oblique photogrammetry technique. Additionally, the platform offers a wide range of interfaces, and all models and scenarios can be customized with a high degree of flexibility. The platform's source code has been released, making it easier to conduct research related to low-altitude traffic.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ERIQ, a benchmark for embodied reasoning in robotic manipulation, along with FACT, a framework enhancing action execution precision, aiming to better integrate reasoning and precision in general-purpose robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving both broad generalization and precision in Vision-Language-Action robotic systems, which typically excel in one area while lacking in the other.

Method: Developed ERIQ to benchmark embodied reasoning and proposed FACT, an action tokenizer that converts continuous control to discrete sequences while preserving trajectory fidelity. Integrated these into GenieReasoner for unified optimization of reasoning and action.

Result: The GenieReasoner, built combining ERIQ's reasoning capability assessment and FACT's action representation, outperformed existing benchmarks in robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: By addressing the reasoning and precision gap with ERIQ and FACT, the work advances the field of robust and generalized robotic manipulation systems.

Abstract: General-purpose robotic systems operating in open-world environments must achieve both broad generalization and high-precision action execution, a combination that remains challenging for existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) improve semantic generalization, insufficient embodied reasoning leads to brittle behavior, and conversely, strong reasoning alone is inadequate without precise control. To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization. To bridge the gap from reasoning to precise execution, we propose FACT, a flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control into discrete sequences while preserving high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction. The resulting GenieReasoner jointly optimizes reasoning and action in a unified space, outperforming both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world tasks. Together, ERIQ and FACT provide a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming the reasoning-precision trade-off, advancing robust, general-purpose robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of ensuring safe and efficient interactions between automated vehicles and human road users in shared traffic environments.

Method: The paper identifies four enablers (advanced perception, vehicular communication, human-robot interaction, and formal traffic specification) and demonstrates a proof-of-concept integrating three of these elements with a cooperative automated e-bike scenario.

Result: The authors present an initial proof-of-concept featuring social robots guiding pedestrians effectively in collaboration with automated e-bikes.

Conclusion: Social robots can serve as effective moderators between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians by integrating critical technological enablers.

Abstract: On the way towards full autonomy, sharing roads between automated vehicles and human actors in so-called mixed traffic is unavoidable. Moreover, even if all vehicles on the road were autonomous, pedestrians would still be crossing the streets. We propose social robots as moderators between autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRU). To this end, we identify four enablers requiring integration: (1) advanced perception, allowing the robot to see the environment; (2) vehicular communications allowing connected vehicles to share intentions and the robot to send guiding commands; (3) social human-robot interaction allowing the robot to effectively communicate with VRUs and drivers; (4) formal specification allowing the robot to understand traffic and plan accordingly. This paper presents an overview of the key enablers and report on a first proof-of-concept integration of the first three enablers envisioning a social robot advising pedestrians in scenarios with a cooperative automated e-bike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling vision-language-action models to bimanual robots with high DoF dexterous hands has challenges such as expanded action space, occlusions, and data collection costs.

Method: GR-Dexter introduces a 21-DoF robotic hand, a teleoperation system for data collection, and a training strategy combining diverse datasets and teleoperated robot trajectories.

Result: GR-Dexter demonstrates strong in-domain performance and robustness in both long-horizon manipulation tasks and novel object/instruction scenarios.

Conclusion: GR-Dexter lays groundwork for generalist robotic dexterous-hand manipulation and advances VLA model capabilities in challenging robotic systems.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have enabled language-conditioned, long-horizon robot manipulation, but most existing systems are limited to grippers. Scaling VLA policies to bimanual robots with high degree-of-freedom (DoF) dexterous hands remains challenging due to the expanded action space, frequent hand-object occlusions, and the cost of collecting real-robot data. We present GR-Dexter, a holistic hardware-model-data framework for VLA-based generalist manipulation on a bimanual dexterous-hand robot. Our approach combines the design of a compact 21-DoF robotic hand, an intuitive bimanual teleoperation system for real-robot data collection, and a training recipe that leverages teleoperated robot trajectories together with large-scale vision-language and carefully curated cross-embodiment datasets. Across real-world evaluations spanning long-horizon everyday manipulation and generalizable pick-and-place, GR-Dexter achieves strong in-domain performance and improved robustness to unseen objects and unseen instructions. We hope GR-Dexter serves as a practical step toward generalist dexterous-hand robotic manipulation.

*Ming-Ming Yu,Yi Chen,Börje F. Karlsson,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RANGER is a zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that uses only a monocular camera, eliminating reliance on depth/pose data while showing superior adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in zero-shot object goal navigation, such as over-reliance on precise depth and pose data and lack of in-context learning (ICL) adaptability to new environments.

Method: RANGER employs monocular camera inputs, integrates 3D foundation models, and features components like keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model-driven exploration, and adaptive waypoint selection.

Result: Experiments conducted on HM3D benchmarks and real-world environments show that RANGER is competitive in success rate and efficiency, with superior ICL capability, requiring no prior 3D mapping.

Conclusion: RANGER extends semantic navigation by removing hardware dependencies, improving adaptability using ICL, and simplifying practical applications in real-world scenarios through monocular camera reliance.

Abstract: Efficiently finding targets in complex environments is fundamental to real-world embodied applications. While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera. Leveraging powerful 3D foundation models, RANGER eliminates the dependency on depth and pose while exhibiting strong ICL capability. By simply observing a short video of a new environment, the system can also significantly improve task efficiency without requiring architectural modifications or fine-tuning. The framework integrates several key components: keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model (VLM)-driven exploration value estimation, high-level adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution. Experiments on the HM3D benchmark and real-world environments demonstrate that RANGER achieves competitive performance in terms of navigation success rate and exploration efficiency, while showing superior ICL adaptability, with no previous 3D mapping of the environment required.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HBO-PID, a novel UAV control algorithm combining Bayesian Optimization with a PID controller to enhance trajectory tracking in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenges of trajectory tracking in UAVs caused by their nonlinear, coupled dynamics and environment variability.

Method: The authors incorporate Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization into the classic PID controller, modeling input noise and using a two-stage optimization for efficiency.

Result: The method improves position accuracy by 24.7%-42.9% and angular accuracy by 40.9%-78.4% over SOTA approaches in simulations and real-world tests.

Conclusion: HBO-PID demonstrates robust trajectory tracking performance, proving more accurate and adaptable than existing methods.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an important role in various applications, where precise trajectory tracking is crucial. However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters. Through experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Compared to SOTA methods, it improves the position accuracy by 24.7% to 42.9%, and the angular accuracy by 40.9% to 78.4%.

TL;DR: The paper addresses constrained motion planning in robotics, proposing a neural network-based method to optimize latent space paths, improving speed and reducing replanning time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of constrained motion planning, particularly addressing the errors in manifold approximation and challenges with collision detection in latent space.

Method: A neural network is trained to predict the robot-obstacle distance using latent vectors, enabling gradient-based movement away from obstacles and local path optimization in latent space.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated the fastest planning speed compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in various scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating the neural network's predictive capabilities with latent space optimization reduces replanning time and enhances motion planning efficiency.

Abstract: Constrained motion planning is a common but challenging problem in robotic manipulation. In recent years, data-driven constrained motion planning algorithms have shown impressive planning speed and success rate. Among them, the latent motion method based on manifold approximation is the most efficient planning algorithm. Due to errors in manifold approximation and the difficulty in accurately identifying collision conflicts within the latent space, time-consuming path validity checks and path replanning are required. In this paper, we propose a method that trains a neural network to predict the minimum distance between the robot and obstacles using latent vectors as inputs. The learned distance gradient is then used to calculate the direction of movement in the latent space to move the robot away from obstacles. Based on this, a local path optimization algorithm in the latent space is proposed, and it is integrated with the path validity checking process to reduce the time of replanning. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in multiple planning scenarios, demonstrating the fastest planning speed

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRL-TH, a framework leveraging temporal graph attention networks and hierarchical pooling for improved autonomous navigation in crowded spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL methods for UGV navigation struggle with single-frame observations and simplistic multi-modal fusion, which limits temporal context capture and adaptability.

Method: The framework employs a Temporal-Guided Graph Attention Network (TG-GAT) and Graph Hierarchical Abstraction Module (GHAM) to integrate historical observations and fuse multi-modal data adaptively.

Result: DRL-TH demonstrated superior performance in various crowded environments and proved effective in real-world applications.

Conclusion: Integrating temporal insights and adaptive multi-modal fusion enhances navigation and obstacle avoidance for UGVs, making the approach promising for practical applications.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have demonstrated potential for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in crowded environments. Most existing approaches rely on single-frame observation and employ simple concatenation for multi-modal fusion, which limits their ability to capture temporal context and hinders dynamic adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based navigation framework, DRL-TH, which leverages temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to integrate historical observations and adaptively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a temporal-guided graph attention network (TG-GAT) that incorporates temporal weights into attention scores to capture correlations between consecutive frames, thereby enabling the implicit estimation of scene evolution. In addition, we design a graph hierarchical abstraction module (GHAM) that applies hierarchical pooling and learnable weighted fusion to dynamically integrate RGB and LiDAR features, achieving balanced representation across multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DRL-TH outperforms existing methods in various crowded environments. We also implemented DRL-TH control policy on a real UGV and showed that it performed well in real world scenarios.

### [327] [Real-world Reinforcement Learning from Suboptimal Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24288)
*Yinuo Zhao,Huiqian Jin,Lechun Jiang,Xinyi Zhang,Kun Wu,Pei Ren,Zhiyuan Xu,Zhengping Che,Lei Sun,Dapeng Wu,Chi Harold Liu,Jian Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SiLRI, a reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages noisy and suboptimal human interventions in robot manipulation tasks to significantly accelerate learning and improve success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods for robotic manipulation rely on optimal human interventions, which may not always be achievable due to errors or suboptimal actions. These methods face inefficiencies when trying to balance imitation of intervention data with robot-collected data.

Method: SiLRI is a state-wise Lagrangian reinforcement learning algorithm designed to manage suboptimal human interventions. It uses constrained RL optimization with uncertainty-based constraints to optimize policy and Lagrange multipliers via min-max optimization.

Result: The algorithm was tested in real-world robot manipulation tasks and reduced the time to reach a 90% success rate by over 50% compared to a state-of-the-art method, achieving perfect success rates in long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: SiLRI successfully exploits noisy and suboptimal human interventions, enhancing both learning efficiency and task success in real-world robotic manipulation contexts.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach to training precise and dexterous robotic manipulation policies in an online manner, enabling robots to learn from their own experience while gradually reducing human labor. However, prior real-world RL methods often assume that human interventions are optimal across the entire state space, overlooking the fact that even expert operators cannot consistently provide optimal actions in all states or completely avoid mistakes. Indiscriminately mixing intervention data with robot-collected data inherits the sample inefficiency of RL, while purely imitating intervention data can ultimately degrade the final performance achievable by RL. The question of how to leverage potentially suboptimal and noisy human interventions to accelerate learning without being constrained by them thus remains open. To address this challenge, we propose SiLRI, a state-wise Lagrangian reinforcement learning algorithm for real-world robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we formulate the online manipulation problem as a constrained RL optimization, where the constraint bound at each state is determined by the uncertainty of human interventions. We then introduce a state-wise Lagrange multiplier and solve the problem via a min-max optimization, jointly optimizing the policy and the Lagrange multiplier to reach a saddle point. Built upon a human-as-copilot teleoperation system, our algorithm is evaluated through real-world experiments on diverse manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that SiLRI effectively exploits human suboptimal interventions, reducing the time required to reach a 90% success rate by at least 50% compared with the state-of-the-art RL method HIL-SERL, and achieving a 100% success rate on long-horizon manipulation tasks where other RL methods struggle to succeed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-training for dexterous hand manipulation lacks scale and diversity, limiting policy generalization in comparison to vision and language models.

Method: WiYH is developed as an open-source ecosystem consisting of: (1) Oracle Suite for accurate wearable motion capture data, (2) a large-scale WiYH Dataset with diverse manipulation scenarios, and (3) benchmarks for tasks spanning perception to action.

Result: Experiments show WiYH data significantly improves generalization and robustness in dexterous hand policy learning for tabletop manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: WiYH contributes valuable human-centric data, annotations, and benchmarks, addressing current limitations and progressing manipulation policy learning research.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training is fundamental for generalization in language and vision models, but data for dexterous hand manipulation remains limited in scale and diversity, hindering policy generalization. Limited scenario diversity, misaligned modalities, and insufficient benchmarking constrain current human manipulation datasets. To address these gaps, we introduce World In Your Hands (WiYH), a large-scale open-source ecosystem for human-centric manipulation learning. WiYH includes (1) the Oracle Suite, a wearable data collection kit with an auto-labeling pipeline for accurate motion capture; (2) the WiYH Dataset, featuring over 1,000 hours of multi-modal manipulation data across hundreds of skills in diverse real-world scenarios; and (3) extensive annotations and benchmarks supporting tasks from perception to action. Furthermore, experiments based on the WiYH ecosystem show that integrating WiYH's human-centric data significantly enhances the generalization and robustness of dexterous hand policies in tabletop manipulation tasks. We believe that World In Your Hands will bring new insights into human-centric data collection and policy learning to the community.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two nonlinear model predictive control (MPC)-based 3D path-following algorithms for small uncrewed aircraft, demonstrating superior real-world feasibility and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve 3D path-following performance and adaptability for fixed-wing small uncrewed aircraft systems motivated the development of advanced guidance algorithms.

Method: Two novel MPC-based approaches were developed: (1) a static reference path rate scheduler for constant inertial speeds, and (2) a dynamic optimizer inspired by model predictive contouring control for weighted path progression and distance tradeoff. Flight tests over high-curvature paths were performed with comparisons to a baseline lookahead guidance law.

Result: The developed MPC guidance algorithms demonstrated real-world feasibility and outperformed the baseline guidance law under high-curvature conditions at speeds up to 36 m/s.

Conclusion: The nonlinear MPC algorithms proposed provide effective and superior performance for 3D path-following guidance in small uncrewed aircraft systems, offering a robust approach for operating over general 3D curves.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and flight test results of two novel 3D path-following guidance algorithms based on nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), with specific application to fixed-wing small uncrewed aircraft systems. To enable MPC, control-augmented modelling and system identification of the RAAVEN small uncrewed aircraft is presented. Two formulations of MPC are then showcased. The first schedules a static reference path rate over the MPC horizon, incentivizing a constant inertial speed. The second, with inspiration from model predictive contouring control, dynamically optimizes for the reference path rate over the controller horizon as the system operates. This allows for a weighted tradeoff between path progression and distance from path, two competing objectives in path-following guidance. Both controllers are formulated to operate over general smooth 3D arc-length parameterized curves. The MPC guidance algorithms are flown over several high-curvature test paths, with comparison to a baseline lookahead guidance law. The results showcase the real-world feasibility and superior performance of nonlinear MPC for 3D path-following guidance at ground speeds up to 36 meters per second.

In this paper, we present GMLD, a learning-based local descriptor framework for large-scale multi-session point cloud map merging that systematically aligns maps collected across different sessions with overlapping regions. The proposed framework employs a keypoint-aware encoder and a plane-based geometric transformer to extract discriminative features for loop closure detection and relative pose estimation. To further improve global consistency, we include inter-session scan matching cost factors in the factor-graph optimization stage. We evaluate our framework on the public datasets, as well as self-collected data from diverse environments. The results show accurate and robust map merging with low error, and the learned features deliver strong performance in both loop closure detection and relative pose estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and reliability of autonomous racing systems through high-fidelity simulations and advanced validation techniques.

Method: The paper utilized a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU)-based simulation, coupled with fault injection modules and automated reporting, running scenarios in a CI/CD environment for validation.

Result: Developed an efficient simulation pipeline capable of executing faster-than-real-time validation and fault injection for autonomous racing modules.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline significantly improves validation processes and robustness in autonomous racing, addressing challenges like high-speed overtaking and fault tolerance.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the automated simulation and reporting pipeline implemented for our autonomous racing stack, ur.autopilot. The backbone of the simulation is based on a high-fidelity model of the vehicle interfaced as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU). The pipeline can execute the software stack and the simulation up to three times faster than real-time, locally or on GitHub for Continuous Integration/- Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). As the most important input of the pipeline, there is a set of running scenarios. Each scenario allows the initialization of the ego vehicle in different initial conditions (position and speed), as well as the initialization of any other configuration of the stack. This functionality is essential to validate efficiently critical modules, like the one responsible for high-speed overtaking maneuvers or localization, which are among the most challenging aspects of autonomous racing. Moreover, we describe how we implemented a fault injection module, capable of introducing sensor delays and perturbations as well as modifying outputs of any node of the stack. Finally, we describe the design of our automated reporting process, aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of the simulation analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Counterfactual Vision-Language-Action (CF-VLA) framework for autonomous driving that enables self-reflection and correction before executing actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving models often lack the capacity to question the safety and appropriateness of their planned actions, leading to potential risks.

Method: CF-VLA generates time-segmented meta-actions summarizing driving intent and leverages counterfactual reasoning to simulate outcomes, identify unsafe behaviors, and revise planned actions. It uses a rollout-filter-label process to train self-reflective capabilities.

Result: CF-VLA increased trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6% and improved safety metrics by 20.5%. It was more adaptive in challenging situations by effectively employing self-reflective reasoning.

Conclusion: CF-VLA advances autonomous driving by incorporating causal self-correction capabilities, enabling vehicles to learn adaptive, safe, and reflective behaviors before executing actions.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have improved the interpretability of end-to-end autonomous driving by generating intermediate reasoning traces. Yet these models primarily describe what they perceive and intend to do, rarely questioning whether their planned actions are safe or appropriate. This work introduces Counterfactual VLA (CF-VLA), a self-reflective VLA framework that enables the model to reason about and revise its planned actions before execution. CF-VLA first generates time-segmented meta-actions that summarize driving intent, and then performs counterfactual reasoning conditioned on both the meta-actions and the visual context. This step simulates potential outcomes, identifies unsafe behaviors, and outputs corrected meta-actions that guide the final trajectory generation. To efficiently obtain such self-reflective capabilities, we propose a rollout-filter-label pipeline that mines high-value scenes from a base (non-counterfactual) VLA's rollouts and labels counterfactual reasoning traces for subsequent training rounds. Experiments on large-scale driving datasets show that CF-VLA improves trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6%, enhances safety metrics by 20.5%, and exhibits adaptive thinking: it only enables counterfactual reasoning in challenging scenarios. By transforming reasoning traces from one-shot descriptions to causal self-correction signals, CF-VLA takes a step toward self-reflective autonomous driving agents that learn to think before they act.

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient end-to-end system capable of generating contextually grounded 3D meshes from a single RGB-D image in less than one second for robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in real-time robotic perception by overcoming slow and insufficient 3D mesh generation methods, ensuring both quality and contextual grounding.

Method: The system integrates open-vocabulary object segmentation, accelerated diffusion-based mesh generation, and robust point cloud registration to ensure high speed and accuracy.

Result: High-quality, contextually grounded 3D meshes were successfully generated in under one second, demonstrating effectiveness in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that meshes can serve as practical, on-demand representations for efficient robotics perception and planning, addressing bottlenecks in previous methods.

Abstract: 3D meshes are a fundamental representation widely used in computer science and engineering. In robotics, they are particularly valuable because they capture objects in a form that aligns directly with how robots interact with the physical world, enabling core capabilities such as predicting stable grasps, detecting collisions, and simulating dynamics. Although automatic 3D mesh generation methods have shown promising progress in recent years, potentially offering a path toward real-time robot perception, two critical challenges remain. First, generating high-fidelity meshes is prohibitively slow for real-time use, often requiring tens of seconds per object. Second, mesh generation by itself is insufficient. In robotics, a mesh must be contextually grounded, i.e., correctly segmented from the scene and registered with the proper scale and pose. Additionally, unless these contextual grounding steps remain efficient, they simply introduce new bottlenecks. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end system that addresses these challenges, producing a high-quality, contextually grounded 3D mesh from a single RGB-D image in under one second. Our pipeline integrates open-vocabulary object segmentation, accelerated diffusion-based mesh generation, and robust point cloud registration, each optimized for both speed and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world manipulation task, showing that it enables meshes to be used as a practical, on-demand representation for robotics perception and planning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Semantic Lookout,' a fallback maneuver selector for autonomous ships using vision-language models to enhance semantic awareness in out-of-design situations while ensuring human control compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for autonomous vessels to handle unforeseen situations in line with the draft IMO MASS Code, specifically by detecting anomalies and ensuring safe and effective fallback controls with human override.

Method: The authors propose a vision-language model-based fallback maneuver selector called 'Semantic Lookout,' using a fast-slow anomaly detection pipeline with cautious action selection under continuous human authority. The model focuses on water-valid, world-anchored trajectories.

Result: The approach showed improved performance in understanding scenes, latency outcomes, alignment with human consensus, and increased safety margins in emergency cases like fire hazards. A field test validated its operation.

Conclusion: Vision-language models provide semantic awareness for fallback maneuvers within practical latency limits, making them suitable for use in autonomous maritime vessels under the IMO MASS Code. The study highlights future opportunities for hybrid autonomy and sensor fusion.

Abstract: The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained vision-language model (VLM) fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method to improve robotic grasp stability by integrating contact stability into surface fitting algorithms, inspired by human grasping techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current surface fitting-based grasp planning algorithms overlook the stability of contact point distribution, resulting in unstable grasps. The paper aims to address this issue by improving the integration of geometric alignment and stability.

Method: The approach involves a three-step grasp pose optimization process: rotation optimization to align contact normals, translation refinement to align the gripper frame with object CoM, and gripper aperture adjustment to optimize contact point distribution.

Result: The proposed method was validated across 15 objects in simulation under both known-shape and observed-shape settings, and across three different robot-gripper platforms. It was further validated in real-world experiments, demonstrating reduced CoM misalignment and higher grasp success rates compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The developed DISF algorithm effectively combines geometric compatibility and stability in robotic grasp planning, leading to improved performance in both simulated and real-world settings.

Abstract: In this work, we address the limitation of surface fitting-based grasp planning algorithm, which primarily focuses on geometric alignment between the gripper and object surface while overlooking the stability of contact point distribution, often resulting in unstable grasps due to inadequate contact configurations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel surface fitting algorithm that integrates contact stability while preserving geometric compatibility. Inspired by human grasping behavior, our method disentangles the grasp pose optimization into three sequential steps: (1) rotation optimization to align contact normals, (2) translation refinement to improve the alignment between the gripper frame origin and the object Center of Mass (CoM), and (3) gripper aperture adjustment to optimize contact point distribution. We validate our approach in simulation across 15 objects under both Known-shape (with clean CAD-derived dataset) and Observed-shape (with YCB object dataset) settings, including cross-platform grasp execution on three robot--gripper platforms. We further validate the method in real-world grasp experiments on a UR3e robot. Overall, DISF reduces CoM misalignment while maintaining geometric compatibility, translating into higher grasp success in both simulation and real-world execution compared to baselines.

Motivation: To address the challenge of computational inefficiency and overfitting in robotic policies when handling large history windows, and to improve state ambiguity resolution.

Method: The authors propose PAM, which uses a hierarchical frame feature extractor and a context router to process long history windows compactly and efficiently. An auxiliary objective for reconstructing historical information ensures effective performance.

Result: PAM supports a 300-frame history window and achieves above 20Hz inference speeds, offering stable training even with 10-second history windows across various state ambiguous tasks.

Conclusion: PAM successfully tackles state ambiguity in robotic tasks by introducing adaptive memory techniques, proving to be both efficient and effective.

Abstract: State ambiguity is common in robotic manipulation. Identical observations may correspond to multiple valid behavior trajectories. The visuomotor policy must correctly extract the appropriate types and levels of information from the history to identify the current task phase. However, naively extending the history window is computationally expensive and may cause severe overfitting. Inspired by the continuous nature of human reasoning and the recoding of working memory, we introduce PAM, a novel visuomotor Policy equipped with Adaptive working Memory. With minimal additional training cost in a two-stage manner, PAM supports a 300-frame history window while maintaining high inference speed. Specifically, a hierarchical frame feature extractor yields two distinct representations for motion primitives and temporal disambiguation. For compact representation, a context router with range-specific queries is employed to produce compact context features across multiple history lengths. And an auxiliary objective of reconstructing historical information is introduced to ensure that the context router acts as an effective bottleneck. We meticulously design 7 tasks and verify that PAM can handle multiple scenarios of state ambiguity simultaneously. With a history window of approximately 10 seconds, PAM still supports stable training and maintains inference speeds above 20Hz. Project website: https://tinda24.github.io/pam/

*Yury Kolomeytsev,Dmitry Golembiovsky*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HMP-DRL combines graph-based planners and Deep Reinforcement Learning for reliable and safe autonomous navigation in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional planning methods excel in specific tasks (e.g., long-range navigation or collision avoidance) but fail to balance these capabilities effectively in human-centric, dynamic scenarios.

Method: HMP-DRL integrates a global planner's path with local DRL policies through encoded checkpoints and entity-aware reward structures designed for socially compliant navigation.

Result: Extensive simulations demonstrated that HMP-DRL outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of navigation success rate, collision rate, and goal-reaching efficiency.

Conclusion: HMP-DRL effectively bridges global and local planning strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous robots in dynamic, human-centric environments.

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots operating in complex, dynamic environments face the dual challenge of navigating large-scale, structurally diverse spaces with static obstacles while safely interacting with various moving agents. Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic manipulation systems struggle due to a lack of diverse real-world demonstrations, limiting generalization in complex, unstructured environments.

Method: The authors developed RoboMIND 2.0, a large-scale dataset, and MIND-2, a hierarchical framework with semantic planning and proprioception-aware motor actions.

Result: RoboMIND 2.0 offers 310K real-world trajectories, tactile-enhanced, mobile manipulation episodes, and simulated data for sim-to-real transfer research.

Conclusion: RoboMIND 2.0 and MIND-2 together enable advancements in robotic manipulation, addressing challenges in long-horizon and unstructured tasks.

Abstract: While data-driven imitation learning has revolutionized robotic manipulation, current approaches remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse real-world demonstrations. Consequently, the ability of existing models to generalize across long-horizon bimanual tasks and mobile manipulation in unstructured environments remains limited. To bridge this gap, we present RoboMIND 2.0, a comprehensive real-world dataset comprising over 310K dual-arm manipulation trajectories collected across six distinct robot embodiments and 739 complex tasks. Crucially, to support research in contact-rich and spatially extended tasks, the dataset incorporates 12K tactile-enhanced episodes and 20K mobile manipulation trajectories. Complementing this physical data, we construct high-fidelity digital twins of our real-world environments, releasing an additional 20K-trajectory simulated dataset to facilitate robust sim-to-real transfer. To fully exploit the potential of RoboMIND 2.0, we propose MIND-2 system, a hierarchical dual-system frame-work optimized via offline reinforcement learning. MIND-2 integrates a high-level semantic planner (MIND-2-VLM) to decompose abstract natural language instructions into grounded subgoals, coupled with a low-level Vision-Language-Action executor (MIND-2-VLA), which generates precise, proprioception-aware motor actions.

*Sungjae Min,Hyungjoo Kim,David Hyunchul Shim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a lightweight anthropomorphic robotic hand actuated by Bowden cables, achieving high dexterity, force, and efficiency while maintaining human-like size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robotic hands capable of human-level dexterity by combining high grasping force, speed, and efficiency in a lightweight, human-sized design.

Method: The design uses Bowden cables for actuation, rolling-contact joint optimization, and antagonistic cable actuation, relocating actuators to the torso to reduce distal mass.

Result: The hand achieved high dexterity with a distal mass of 236g, over 18N fingertip force, and payload lifting over 100 times its own weight.

Conclusion: The proposed design meets the demands of dexterous performance and robustness within a lightweight, anthropomorphic framework.

Abstract: Humanoid robots toward human-level dexterity require robotic hands capable of simultaneously providing high grasping force, rapid actuation speeds, multiple degrees of freedom, and lightweight structures within human-like size constraints. Meeting these conflicting requirements remains challenging, as satisfying this combination typically necessitates heavier actuators and bulkier transmission systems, significantly restricting the payload capacity of robot arms. In this letter, we present a lightweight anthropomorphic hand actuated by Bowden cables, which uniquely combines rolling-contact joint optimization with antagonistic cable actuation, enabling single-motor-per-joint control with negligible cable-length deviation. By relocating the actuator module to the torso, the design substantially reduces distal mass while maintaining anthropomorphic scale and dexterity. Additionally, this antagonistic cable actuation eliminates the need for synchronization between motors. Using the proposed methods, the hand assembly with a distal mass of 236g (excluding remote actuators and Bowden sheaths) demonstrated reliable execution of dexterous tasks, exceeding 18N fingertip force and lifting payloads over one hundred times its own mass. Furthermore, robustness was validated through Cutkosky taxonomy grasps and trajectory consistency under perturbed actuator-hand transformations.

TL;DR: The paper presents VLA-RAIL, a framework addressing issues in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by ensuring smooth and real-time robotic action execution for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics using VLA models face challenges like jitter and stalling in motion execution, limiting task success rates and execution speeds. The paper aims to improve real-time, continuous robot control.

Method: The VLA-RAIL framework proposes a Trajectory Smoother using polynomial fitting to reduce noise and jitter, and a Chunk Fuser to ensure seamless and continuous transition between action chunks.

Result: Experimental validation in simulation and real-world tasks shows that VLA-RAIL reduces jitter, increases execution speed, and improves task completion success rates.

Conclusion: VLA-RAIL elevates VLA model efficiency by addressing existing execution issues, positioning it as crucial for large-scale VLA model deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReSPIRe, a novel approach for target search and tracking (SAT) in unknown, cluttered environments, enhancing information gathering, efficiency, and tracking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in target search and tracking (SAT) under conditions of limited sensing, cluttered unknown environments, and inaccurate prior information.

Method: ReSPIRe uses a sigma point-based approximation to estimate mutual information (MI) for reward calculation, a hierarchical particle structure for better route guidance and efficiency, and a reusable belief tree search for policy planning.

Result: ReSPIRe achieves lower MI approximation error, higher search efficiency, and better tracking performance with reduced computational cost compared to benchmark methods, demonstrated through simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: ReSPIRe is a robust and computationally efficient method for planning informative trajectories in SAT tasks under uncertainty, making it a valuable contribution to robotic applications.

Abstract: Target search and tracking (SAT) is a fundamental problem for various robotic applications such as search and rescue and environmental exploration. This paper proposes an informative trajectory planning approach, namely ReSPIRe, for SAT in unknown cluttered environments under considerably inaccurate prior target information and limited sensing field of view. We first develop a novel sigma point-based approximation approach to fast and accurately estimate mutual information reward under non-Gaussian belief distributions, utilizing informative sampling in state and observation spaces to mitigate the computational intractability of integral calculation. To tackle significant uncertainty associated with inadequate prior target information, we propose the hierarchical particle structure in ReSPIRe, which not only extracts critical particles for global route guidance, but also adjusts the particle number adaptively for planning efficiency. Building upon the hierarchical structure, we develop the reusable belief tree search approach to build a policy tree for online trajectory planning under uncertainty, which reuses rollout evaluation to improve planning efficiency. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that ReSPIRe outperforms representative benchmark methods with smaller MI approximation error, higher search efficiency, and more stable tracking performance, while maintaining outstanding computational efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CREPES-X, a framework enhancing accuracy, speed, and robustness for relative localization in multi-robot systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-robot localization systems face challenges such as reliance on environmental features and degradation in complex environments, making robust multi-robot localization difficult.

Method: The proposed method involves a compact hardware system and a two-stage hierarchical estimator to address speed, accuracy, and robustness in relative localization, using techniques like closed-form solutions and IMU-based kinematic optimization.

Result: CREPES-X demonstrated high robustness, handling up to 90% bearing outliers, and achieved high accuracy with RMSE of 0.073m and 1.817° in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: CREPES-X effectively provides a resilient and accurate solution for relative localization across challenging scenarios without depending on global information.

Abstract: Relative localization is critical for cooperation in autonomous multi-robot systems. Existing approaches either rely on shared environmental features or inertial assumptions or suffer from non-line-of-sight degradation and outliers in complex environments. Robust and efficient fusion of inter-robot measurements such as bearings, distances, and inertials for tens of robots remains challenging. We present CREPES-X (Cooperative RElative Pose Estimation System with multiple eXtended features), a hierarchical relative localization framework that enhances speed, accuracy, and robustness under challenging conditions, without requiring any global information. CREPES-X starts with a compact hardware design: InfraRed (IR) LEDs, an IR camera, an ultra-wideband module, and an IMU housed in a cube no larger than 6cm on each side. Then CREPES-X implements a two-stage hierarchical estimator to meet different requirements, considering speed, accuracy, and robustness. First, we propose a single-frame relative estimator that provides instant relative poses for multi-robot setups through a closed-form solution and robust bearing outlier rejection. Then a multi-frame relative estimator is designed to offer accurate and robust relative states by exploring IMU pre-integration via robocentric relative kinematics with loosely- and tightly-coupled optimization. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of CREPES-X, showing robustness to up to 90% bearing outliers, proving resilience in challenging conditions, and achieving RMSE of 0.073m and 1.817° in real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a continuation-based learning framework for dynamic motion generation in legged robots using simplified model pretraining and gradual transfer to a full model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots face challenges in generating dynamic motions due to the need for extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations in reinforcement learning. Simplified models can ease this, but transferring policies to full-body dynamics remains difficult.

Method: The approach starts with pretraining a policy on a simplified single rigid body model. A continuation strategy, using model homotopy, progressively transfers the policy to the full body by redistributing mass and inertia.

Result: The method results in faster convergence, superior stability during transfer, and improved performance compared to baseline methods, validated through dynamic tasks and real robot deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between simplified models and full-body environments, enabling efficient and stable dynamic motion generation in legged robots.

Abstract: Generating dynamic motions for legged robots remains a challenging problem. While reinforcement learning has achieved notable success in various legged locomotion tasks, producing highly dynamic behaviors often requires extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations. Leveraging reduced-order models can help mitigate these challenges. However, the model discrepancy poses a significant challenge when transferring policies to full-body dynamics environments. In this work, we introduce a continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate and refine complex dynamic behaviors. First, we pretrain the policy using a single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns in a simplified environment. Next, we employ a continuation strategy to progressively transfer the policy to the full-body environment, minimizing performance loss. To define the continuation path, we introduce a model homotopy from the single rigid body model to the full-body model by gradually redistributing mass and inertia between the trunk and legs. The proposed method not only achieves faster convergence but also demonstrates superior stability during the transfer process compared to baseline methods. Our framework is validated on a range of dynamic tasks, including flips and wall-assisted maneuvers, and is successfully deployed on a real quadrupedal robot.

### [344] [LSRE: Latent Semantic Rule Encoding for Real-Time Semantic Risk Detection in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24712)
*Qian Cheng,Weitao Zhou,Cheng Jing,Nanshan Deng,Junze Wen,Zhaoyang Liu,Kun Jiang,Diange Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces LSRE, a framework for encoding semantic safety rules into latent classifiers for real-time autonomous driving risk assessment, achieving efficiency and accuracy without frequent queries to large vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles struggle with adhering to complex human-centric semantic rules not covered by traditional traffic laws, as encoding such semantics explicitly is challenging and computationally expensive.

Method: The authors propose LSRE, which leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) to sparsely sample semantic judgments and encode them into the latent space of a recurrent world model, enabling lightweight, real-time risk assessments.

Result: In CARLA simulations, LSRE demonstrated comparable semantic risk detection accuracy to large VLM baselines, with faster hazard anticipation and lower computational costs. It also generalized well to novel but semantically similar scenarios.

Conclusion: LSRE offers a practical, efficient, and scalable approach to monitor semantic safety in autonomous driving by integrating language-guided latent semantic classifications.

Abstract: Real-world autonomous driving must adhere to complex human social rules that extend beyond legally codified traffic regulations. Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.

Motivation: Autonomous microrobots need robust locomotion on varying terrain under constraints of compute, memory, and power.

Method: A reinforcement learning-trained MLP policy using domain randomization is deployed on a low-resource microcontroller with quantization techniques to optimize inference updates.

Result: The trained policy demonstrated enhanced locomotion efficacy with hardware-aware gait optimization and robust behavior in simulation and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Edge ML and domain-randomized RL can improve microrobot control under resource constraints and demonstrate better stability over uneven terrain.

Abstract: An important function of autonomous microrobots is the ability to perform robust movement over terrain. This paper explores an edge ML approach to microrobot locomotion, allowing for on-device, lower latency control under compute, memory, and power constraints. This paper explores the locomotion of a sub-centimeter quadrupedal microrobot via reinforcement learning (RL) and deploys the resulting controller on an ultra-small system-on-chip (SoC), SC$μ$M-3C, featuring an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller running at 5 MHz. We train a compact FP32 multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy with two hidden layers ($[128, 64]$) in a massively parallel GPU simulation and enhance robustness by utilizing domain randomization over simulation parameters. We then study integer (Int8) quantization (per-tensor and per-feature) to allow for higher inference update rates on our resource-limited hardware, and we connect hardware power budgets to achievable update frequency via a cycles-per-update model for inference on our Cortex-M0. We propose a resource-aware gait scheduling viewpoint: given a device power budget, we can select the gait mode (trot/intermediate/gallop) that maximizes expected RL reward at a corresponding feasible update frequency. Finally, we deploy our MLP policy on a real-world large-scale robot on uneven terrain, qualitatively noting that domain-randomized training can improve out-of-distribution stability. We do not claim real-world large-robot empirical zero-shot transfer in this work.

Conclusion: Dream2Flow provides a scalable and general solution for using generative video models to guide robotic manipulation, overcoming the embodiment gap between abstract video models and specific robot actions.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has emerged as a compelling tool to zero-shot reason about plausible physical interactions for open-world manipulation. Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ArtiSG, a framework for creating functional 3D scene graphs using human demonstrations to aid robots in manipulation tasks, addressing challenges like visual ambiguity and missed functional elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often face challenges in understanding functional aspects of articulated objects for manipulation tasks due to limitations in existing 3D scene graph approaches.

Method: The authors developed a robust articulation data pipeline to collect interaction data, estimate articulation trajectories despite camera ego-motion, and create hierarchical open-vocabulary graphs combining kinematic priors and interaction data.

Result: ArtiSG significantly surpassed baseline methods in recalling functional elements and achieving precise articulation estimation through extensive real-world experiments.

Conclusion: ArtiSG enables robots to utilize functional 3D scene graphs as dependable memory for performing language-based manipulation tasks efficiently in diverse environments.

Abstract: 3D scene graphs have empowered robots with semantic understanding for navigation and planning, yet they often lack the functional information required for physical manipulation, particularly regarding articulated objects. Existing approaches for inferring articulation mechanisms from static observations are prone to visual ambiguity, while methods that estimate parameters from state changes typically rely on constrained settings such as fixed cameras and unobstructed views. Furthermore, fine-grained functional elements like small handles are frequently missed by general object detectors. To bridge this gap, we present ArtiSG, a framework that constructs functional 3D scene graphs by encoding human demonstrations into structured robotic memory. Our approach leverages a robust articulation data collection pipeline utilizing a portable setup to accurately estimate 6-DoF articulation trajectories and axes even under camera ego-motion. We integrate these kinematic priors into a hierarchical and open-vocabulary graph while utilizing interaction data to discover inconspicuous functional elements missed by visual perception. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that ArtiSG significantly outperforms baselines in functional element recall and articulation estimation precision. Moreover, we show that the constructed graph serves as a reliable functional memory that effectively guides robots to perform language-directed manipulation tasks in real-world environments containing diverse articulated objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulating DLOs is challenging due to their high-dimensional state spaces, complex deformations, and workspace constraints. Efficient planning and tracking methods are essential for practical DLO manipulation.

Method: The framework includes hierarchical deformation planning to generate spatial path sets that satisfy homotopic constraints, a path-set-guided optimization for creating temporal deformation sequences, and a neural model predictive control for precision tracking during execution.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework's robustness and effectiveness in constrained DLO manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: This novel framework addresses DLO manipulation challenges with reliable planning and tracking, proving practical in constrained environments.

Abstract: Deformable linear objects (DLOs) manipulation presents significant challenges due to DLOs' inherent high-dimensional state space and complex deformation dynamics. The wide-populated obstacles in realistic workspaces further complicate DLO manipulation, necessitating efficient deformation planning and robust deformation tracking. In this work, we propose a novel framework for DLO manipulation in constrained environments. This framework combines hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracking, ensuring reliable performance in both global deformation synthesis and local deformation tracking. Specifically, the deformation planner begins by generating a spatial path set that inherently satisfies the homotopic constraints associated with DLO keypoint paths. Next, a path-set-guided optimization method is applied to synthesize an optimal temporal deformation sequence for the DLO. In manipulation execution, a neural model predictive control approach, leveraging a data-driven deformation model, is designed to accurately track the planned DLO deformation sequence. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in extensive constrained DLO manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The paper provides a scalable approach to data collection and learning for humanoid robots, offering a practical pathway to tackling coordinated manipulation in complex and unstructured environments.

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold great promise for operating in human-centric environments, yet achieving robust whole-body coordination across the head, hands, and legs remains a major challenge. We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Unifico is a multi-ISA compiler designed to support heterogeneous-ISA processors by generating binaries that maintain consistent stack layouts and avoid runtime overheads. It is implemented using LLVM and evaluated on ARMv8 and x86-64 architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of efficient compilation toolchains for heterogeneous-ISA processors and overcome runtime overheads, particularly costly stack transformations during ISA migration.

Method: Developed Unifico, a LLVM-based multi-ISA compiler that ensures uniform stack layout, ABI, and virtual address space across different ISAs, avoiding runtime stack transformation.

Result: Unifico demonstrated minimal execution time overhead (less than 6% for high-end processors and 10% for low-end processors) while substantially reducing binary size overhead compared to previous solutions like Popcorn compiler.

Conclusion: Unifico optimizes heterogeneous-ISA compilation by eliminating runtime stack transformations, reducing binary overheads, and maintaining efficient execution performance, paving the way for improved research and application in heterogeneous architectures.

Abstract: Heterogeneous-ISA processor designs have attracted considerable research interest. However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, "getting right" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AgenticTCAD, a natural language-driven multi-agent framework for automating device design and optimization in advanced technology nodes. It drastically reduces device design time compared to human experts using commercial tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of open-source TCAD resources limits language model capabilities for valid TCAD code generation. Efficient device design and optimization are critical with continual scaling of advanced technology nodes.

Method: A domain-specific dataset for TCAD was curated by experts and used to fine-tune a language model. The proposed AgenticTCAD framework integrates this model into a multi-agent system enabling natural-language-driven, end-to-end device design and optimization.

Result: AgenticTCAD successfully designed a 2nm nanosheet FET (NS-FET) in compliance with IRDS-2024 specifications within 4.2 hours, far outperforming human experts who needed 7.1 days.

Conclusion: AgenticTCAD demonstrates the potential for natural language-driven multi-agent systems to revolutionize device design by significantly reducing time and reliance on traditional tools, enhancing efficiency in DTCO workflows.

Abstract: With the continued scaling of advanced technology nodes, the design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) paradigm has become increasingly critical, rendering efficient device design and optimization essential. In the domain of TCAD simulation, however, the scarcity of open-source resources hinders language models from generating valid TCAD code. To overcome this limitation, we construct an open-source TCAD dataset curated by experts and fine-tune a domain-specific model for TCAD code generation. Building on this foundation, we propose AgenticTCAD, a natural language - driven multi-agent framework that enables end-to-end automated device design and optimization. Validation on a 2 nm nanosheet FET (NS-FET) design shows that AgenticTCAD achieves the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS)-2024 device specifications within 4.2 hours, whereas human experts required 7.1 days with commercial tools.

*Yunguo Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hybrid-Code, a reliable and privacy-preserving clinical coding framework combining AI-based semantic reasoning, deterministic fallback mechanisms, and symbolic verification for on-premise healthcare systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical coding automation using cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) faces privacy risks and latency issues, making them unsuitable for deployment in healthcare settings where reliability and local processing are essential.

Method: The authors developed a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework, Hybrid-Code, that combines a semantic reasoning agent (using BioMistral-7B) for language understanding, a deterministic keyword matching fallback, and a verification agent that uses a knowledge base to ensure code accuracy and evidence-based validation.

Result: When evaluated on 1,000 MIMIC-III discharge summaries, Hybrid-Code showed no hallucinated codes, verified 24.47% of outputs, achieved 34.11% coverage, and effectively utilized the language model in over 86% of cases. It also rejected 75.53% invalid format codes, ensuring data reliability and privacy.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively balances reliability, privacy, and accuracy, demonstrating that redundancy and fault-tolerant design are more critical than pure AI model performance for adoption in production healthcare systems.

Abstract: Clinical coding automation using cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) poses privacy risks and latency bottlenecks, rendering them unsuitable for on-premise healthcare deployment. We introduce Hybrid-Code, a hybrid neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for local clinical coding that ensures production reliability through redundancy and verification. Our system comprises two agents: a Coder that attempts language model-based semantic reasoning using BioMistral-7B but falls back to deterministic keyword matching when model output is unreliable, ensuring pipeline completion; and an Auditor that verifies codes against a 257-code knowledge base and clinical evidence. Evaluating on 1,000 MIMIC-III discharge summaries, we demonstrate no hallucinated codes among accepted outputs within the knowledge base, 24.47% verification rate, and 34.11% coverage (95% CI: 31.2%--37.0%) with 86%+ language model utilization. The Auditor filtered invalid format codes and provided evidence-based quality control (75.53% rejection rate) while ensuring no patient data leaves the hospital firewall. The hybrid architecture -- combining language model semantic understanding (when successful), deterministic fallback (when the model fails), and symbolic verification (always active) -- ensures both reliability and privacy preservation, addressing critical barriers to AI adoption in healthcare. Our key finding is that reliability through redundancy is more valuable than pure model performance in production healthcare systems, where system failures are unacceptable.

*Wei Li,Yan Zou,Yixin Liang,José Moura,Shawn Blanton*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DEFT is a new approach to automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) for detecting hard-to-detect faults in integrated circuits, achieving significant performance improvements compared to commercial tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although modern integrated circuits are increasingly complex, current ATPG methods struggle with detecting hard-to-detect faults, leading to an inefficiency in test design. There is a need for ATPG algorithms that specifically target these faults to improve test outcomes.

Method: DEFT reformulates the discrete ATPG problem into a continuous optimization problem. Utilizing a reparameterization aligned with fault-detection semantics, it enables gradient-based pattern generation. DEFT integrates custom CUDA kernels for efficient computation and employs gradient normalization for stability in deep circuit graphs.

Result: Compared to commercial tools, DEFT shows an average improvement of 21.1%-48.9% in hard-to-detect fault detection under the same pattern budget. It also reduces 0/1 bits by 19.3% while detecting 35% more faults in partial assignment settings.

Conclusion: DEFT is a powerful and scalable ATPG method that enhances fault detection performance, making it a valuable complement to heuristic approaches in industrial applications.

Abstract: Modern IC complexity drives test pattern growth, with the majority of patterns targeting a small set of hard-to-detect (HTD) faults. This motivates new ATPG algorithms to improve test effectiveness specifically for HTD faults. This paper presents DEFT (Differentiable Automatic Test Pattern Generation), a new ATPG approach that reformulates the discrete ATPG problem as a continuous optimization task. DEFT introduces a mathematically grounded reparameterization that aligns the expected continuous objective with discrete fault-detection semantics, enabling reliable gradient-based pattern generation. To ensure scalability and stability on deep circuit graphs, DEFT integrates a custom CUDA kernel for efficient forward-backward propagation and applies gradient normalization to mitigate vanishing gradients. Compared to a leading commercial tool on two industrial benchmarks, DEFT improves HTD fault detection by 21.1% and 48.9% on average under the same pattern budget and comparable runtime. DEFT also supports practical ATPG settings such as partial assignment pattern generation, producing patterns with 19.3% fewer 0/1 bits while still detecting 35% more faults. These results indicate DEFT is a promising and effective ATPG engine, offering a valuable complement to existing heuristic.

Motivation: The study aims to demonstrate that compact models can achieve frontier-grade performance in code generation and workflows, challenging the reliance on larger baseline models.

Method: Mify-Coder uses optimized training strategies, including agentically designed prompts, iteratively refined synthetic data, LLM-based filtering, and principled data-compute discipline.

Conclusion: Efficiently trained compact models like Mify-Coder can deliver competitive performance in code intelligence, proving that smaller models can rival larger ones in various practical applications.

Abstract: We present Mify-Coder, a 2.5B-parameter code model trained on 4.2T tokens using a compute-optimal strategy built on the Mify-2.5B foundation model. Mify-Coder achieves comparable accuracy and safety while significantly outperforming much larger baseline models on standard coding and function-calling benchmarks, demonstrating that compact models can match frontier-grade models in code generation and agent-driven workflows. Our training pipeline combines high-quality curated sources with synthetic data generated through agentically designed prompts, refined iteratively using enterprise-grade evaluation datasets. LLM-based quality filtering further enhances data density, enabling frugal yet effective training. Through disciplined exploration of CPT-SFT objectives, data mixtures, and sampling dynamics, we deliver frontier-grade code intelligence within a single continuous training trajectory. Empirical evidence shows that principled data and compute discipline allow smaller models to achieve competitive accuracy, efficiency, and safety compliance. Quantized variants of Mify-Coder enable deployment on standard desktop environments without requiring specialized hardware.

### [355] [Uncovering Discrimination Clusters: Quantifying and Explaining Systematic Fairness Violations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23769)
*Ranit Debnath Akash,Ashish Kumar,Verya Monjezi,Ashutosh Trivedi,Gang,Tan,Saeid Tizpaz-Niari*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces "discrimination clustering" as an extension to individual fairness, and proposes HyFair, a tool for detecting systematic areas of algorithmic bias using symbolic and random search techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in current fairness frameworks, aiming to detect broader patterns of discrimination rather than isolated instances in algorithmic decision-making.

Method: It introduces HyFair, a hybrid verification tool combining symbolic analysis (SMT and MILP solvers) with randomized search to identify clusters of discrimination based on protected attributes. It also offers an explanation method using interpretable decision-tree artifacts.

Result: HyFair provides formal fairness guarantees and uncovers areas of algorithmic bias. Experimental results show it surpasses existing fairness verification and explanation techniques.

Conclusion: By broadening fairness detection to systematic biases, HyFair enhances the understanding and rectification of algorithmic unfairness, helping expose more latent discriminatory patterns.

Abstract: Fairness in algorithmic decision-making is often framed in terms of individual fairness, which requires that similar individuals receive similar outcomes. A system violates individual fairness if there exists a pair of inputs differing only in protected attributes (such as race or gender) that lead to significantly different outcomes-for example, one favorable and the other unfavorable. While this notion highlights isolated instances of unfairness, it fails to capture broader patterns of systematic or clustered discrimination that may affect entire subgroups. We introduce and motivate the concept of discrimination clustering, a generalization of individual fairness violations. Rather than detecting single counterfactual disparities, we seek to uncover regions of the input space where small perturbations in protected features lead to k-significantly distinct clusters of outcomes. That is, for a given input, we identify a local neighborhood-differing only in protected attributes-whose members' outputs separate into many distinct clusters. These clusters reveal significant arbitrariness in treatment solely based on protected attributes that help expose patterns of algorithmic bias that elude pairwise fairness checks. We present HyFair, a hybrid technique that combines formal symbolic analysis (via SMT and MILP solvers) to certify individual fairness with randomized search to discover discriminatory clusters. This combination enables both formal guarantees-when no counterexamples exist-and the detection of severe violations that are computationally challenging for symbolic methods alone. Given a set of inputs exhibiting high k-unfairness, we introduce a novel explanation method to generate interpretable, decision-tree-style artifacts. Our experiments demonstrate that HyFair outperforms state-of-the-art fairness verification and local explanation methods.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in software-centric automotive testing by identifying issues and recommending solutions like model-based planning, better toolchains, and automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deal with the increasing complexity and demand for systematic and effective testing in automotive embedded systems due to the shift towards software-centric development.

Method: Conducting a systematic literature review complemented by industry input, mapping challenges to testing tools/techniques, evaluating them using PRISMA, and proposing a criteria catalog.

Result: The identification of nine recurring challenges in automotive system testing and a curated catalog of prioritized criteria and solutions for tool/technique improvements.

Conclusion: The paper offers a practical contribution to improving automotive system testing by providing actionable recommendations that address testing challenges, aiming to streamline and enhance future frameworks.

Abstract: The automotive domain is shifting to software-centric development to meet regulation, market pressure, and feature velocity. This shift increases embedded systems' complexity and strains testing capacity. Despite relevant standards, a coherent system-testing methodology that spans heterogeneous, legacy-constrained toolchains remains elusive, and practice often depends on individual expertise rather than a systematic strategy. We derive challenges and requirements from a systematic literature review (SLR), complemented by industry experience and practice. We map them to test case specification techniques and testing tools, evaluating their suitability for automotive testing using PRISMA. Our contribution is a curated catalog that supports technique/tool selection and can inform future testing frameworks and improvements. We synthesize nine recurring challenge areas across the life cycle, such as requirements quality and traceability, variability management, and toolchain fragmentation. We then provide a prioritized criteria catalog that recommends model-based planning, interoperable and traceable toolchains, requirements uplift, pragmatic automation and virtualization, targeted AI and formal methods, actionable metrics, and lightweight organizational practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in software systems is crucial but achieving a comprehensive understanding of fairness-focused solutions is challenging.

Method: A classification framework was applied to 95 selected studies, analyzing advancements and industrial adoption potential in fairness research.

Result: The research is expanding but focuses heavily on methods and algorithms, with limited early-stage interventions or industrial collaboration, resulting in low industrial transferability.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of incorporating fairness throughout the software development life-cycle and the need for stronger academia-industry collaboration to advance fairness adoption.

Abstract: Context: Fairness in systems has emerged as a critical concern in software engineering, garnering increasing attention as the field has advanced in recent years. While several guidelines have been proposed to address fairness, achieving a comprehensive understanding of research solutions for ensuring fairness in software systems remains challenging. Objectives: This paper presents a systematic literature mapping to explore and categorize current advancements in fairness solutions within software engineering, focusing on three key dimensions: research trends, research focus, and viability in industrial contexts. Methods: We develop a classification framework to organize research on software fairness from a fresh perspective, applying it to 95 selected studies and analyzing their potential for industrial adoption. Results: Our findings reveal that software fairness research is expanding, yet it remains heavily focused on methods and algorithms. It primarily focuses on post-processing and group fairness, with less emphasis on early-stage interventions, individual fairness metrics, and understanding bias root causes. Additionally fairness research remains largely academic, with limited industry collaboration and low to medium Technology Readiness Level (TRL), indicating that industrial transferability remains distant. Conclusion: Our results underscore the need to incorporate fairness considerations across all stages of the software development life-cycle and to foster greater collaboration between academia and industry. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the field, offering a foundation to guide future research and practical applications of fairness in software systems.

### [358] [From Correctness to Collaboration: Toward a Human-Centered Framework for Evaluating AI Agent Behavior in Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23844)
*Tao Dong,Harini Sampath,Ja Young Lee,Sherry Y. Shi,Andrew Macvean*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in software engineering focus mainly on code correctness, neglecting essential collaborative aspects. This paper proposes a taxonomy and framework to assess nuanced agent behaviors in human-AI partnerships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are transitioning from simple code generators to collaborative partners in software engineering, necessitating new evaluation methods to understand and measure effective human-AI interactions.

Method: The paper first defines a taxonomy of desired agent behaviors derived from user-defined rules, focusing on standards adherence, code quality, problem-solving, and collaboration. It then introduces the CAB Framework, which considers dynamic shifts in expectations based on time horizon and type of work.

Result: A taxonomy of four key behavioral expectations and a context-adaptive framework were developed, supported by empirical insights from expert interviews and analyses. These tools emphasize the human-centered evaluation of AI agents in software engineering contexts.

Conclusion: Moving evaluation metrics beyond code correctness to include collaborative dynamics will enable the design of AI systems better suited to human-AI partnerships in enterprise software engineering.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from code generators into collaborative partners for software engineers, our methods for evaluation are lagging. Current benchmarks, focused on code correctness, fail to capture the nuanced, interactive behaviors essential for successful human-AI partnership. To bridge this evaluation gap, this paper makes two core contributions. First, we present a foundational taxonomy of desirable agent behaviors for enterprise software engineering, derived from an analysis of 91 sets of user-defined agent rules. This taxonomy defines four key expectations of agent behavior: Adhere to Standards and Processes, Ensure Code Quality and Reliability, Solving Problems Effectively, and Collaborating with the User.
  Second, recognizing that these expectations are not static, we introduce the Context-Adaptive Behavior (CAB) Framework. This emerging framework reveals how behavioral expectations shift along two empirically-derived axes: the Time Horizon (from immediate needs to future ideals), established through interviews with 15 expert engineers, and the Type of Work (from enterprise production to rapid prototyping, for example), identified through a prompt analysis of a prototyping agent. Together, these contributions offer a human-centered foundation for designing and evaluating the next generation of AI agents, moving the field's focus from the correctness of generated code toward the dynamics of true collaborative intelligence.

### [359] [From Illusion to Insight: Change-Aware File-Level Software Defect Prediction Using Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23875)
*Mohsen Hesamolhokama,Behnam Rohani,Amirahmad Shafiee,MohammadAmin Fazli,Jafar Habibi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Current software defect prediction (SDP) methods overstate success by rewarding persistence in defect labels across versions. This paper proposes a new, change-aware approach using large language models (LLMs) and a multi-agent debate framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SDP focuses on file snapshots and benefits from the continuity of defect labels, which is misleading and fails to adequately address defect-transition cases.

Method: Reformulating the problem as change-aware prediction, the authors developed an LLM-driven, multi-agent debate framework to reason over code changes between file versions.

Result: Results showed that traditional models perform poorly in defect-transition cases, while the proposed framework delivers balanced performance and improves sensitivity to identifying defect introductions.

Conclusion: SDP evaluation needs to shift to a change-aware approach to address critical defect-transition scenarios effectively, as the traditional methods are fundamentally flawed.

Abstract: Much of the reported progress in file-level software defect prediction (SDP) is, in reality, nothing but an illusion of accuracy. Over the last decades, machine learning and deep learning models have reported increasing performance across software versions. However, since most files persist across releases and retain their defect labels, standard evaluation rewards label-persistence bias rather than reasoning about code changes. To address this issue, we reformulate SDP as a change-aware prediction task, in which models reason over code changes of a file within successive project versions, rather than relying on static file snapshots. Building on this formulation, we propose an LLM-driven, change-aware, multi-agent debate framework. Our experiments on multiple PROMISE projects show that traditional models achieve inflated F1, while failing on rare but critical defect-transition cases. In contrast, our change-aware reasoning and multi-agent debate framework yields more balanced performance across evolution subsets and significantly improves sensitivity to defect introductions. These results highlight fundamental flaws in current SDP evaluation practices and emphasize the need for change-aware reasoning in practical defect prediction. The source code is publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how large language model (LLM)-based coding tools affect professional software development practices, identifying productivity gains, workflow changes, and risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the underexplored perspectives of industrial practitioners regarding the use of LLM coding tools, as prior research has concentrated on individuals and educational contexts.

Method: The authors conducted a qualitative analysis of 57 curated YouTube videos from late 2024–2025, filtering for quality, and then analyzed the content to compare traditional and LLM-based programming practices.

Result: The study finds widespread productivity gains, lower barriers to entry for developers, and shifts in bottlenecks to tasks like code review. However, concerns arise about code quality, security, ethical issues, and the lack of preparation in entry-level engineers.

Conclusion: The paper suggests updates to computing education curricula, emphasizing problem-solving, architectural thinking, and project-based learning integrated with LLM tools, to better align with industry practices.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new paradigms in software development, including vibe coding, AI-assisted coding, and agentic coding, fundamentally reshaping how software is designed, implemented, and maintained. Prior research has primarily examined AI-based coding at the individual level or in educational settings, leaving industrial practitioners' perspectives underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how LLM coding tools are used in professional practice, the associated concerns and risks, and the resulting transformations in development workflows, with particular attention to implications for computing education. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 57 curated YouTube videos published between late 2024 and 2025, capturing reflections and experiences shared by practitioners. Following a filtering and quality assessment process, the selected sources were analyzed to compare LLM-based and traditional programming, identify emerging risks, and characterize evolving workflows. Our findings reveal definitions of AI-based coding practices, notable productivity gains, and lowered barriers to entry. Practitioners also report a shift in development bottlenecks toward code review and concerns regarding code quality, maintainability, security vulnerabilities, ethical issues, erosion of foundational problem-solving skills, and insufficient preparation of entry-level engineers. Building on these insights, we discuss implications for computer science and software engineering education and argue for curricular shifts toward problem-solving, architectural thinking, code review, and early project-based learning that integrates LLM tools. This study offers an industry-grounded perspective on AI-based coding and provides guidance for aligning educational practices with rapidly evolving professional realities.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A method is developed for creating controlled natural language for requirements using formal specification patterns and an AI assistant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically create clear and precise natural language requirements based on formal specification patterns.

Method: The method involves: 1) Generalizing requirement patterns using templates; 2) Employing AI to generate requirement pattern corpora; 3) Formalizing controlled natural language syntax.

Result: The method was successfully tested for event-driven temporal requirements.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates a systematic strategy for bridging formal specifications with controlled natural language to improve requirement clarity and precision.

Abstract: Using an AI assistant, we developed a method for systematically constructing controlled natural language for requirements based on formal specification patterns containing logical attributes. The method involves three stages: 1) compiling a generalized natural language requirement pattern that utilizes all attributes of the formal specification template; 2) generating, using the AI assistant, a corpus of natural language requirement patterns, reduced by partially evaluating attributes (the developed prompt utilizes the generalized template, attribute definitions, and specific formal semantics of the requirement patterns); and 3) formalizing the syntax of the controlled natural language based on an analysis of the grammatical structure of the resulting patterns. The method has been tested for event-driven temporal requirements.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoHalLo, a model for line-level localization of hallucinated code, using syntactic information and probing hidden-layer vectors, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of fine-grained hallucination identification in AI-generated code and improve developers' ability to debug and enhance code reliability.

Method: A model (CoHalLo) that fine-tunes hallucination detection models, utilizes a probe network for syntactic structure projection, and compares generated syntactic structures to pinpoint hallucinated lines.

Result: CoHalLo demonstrated superior performance with metrics such as Top-1 accuracy of 0.4253 and significant improvements over baseline methods in hallucination localization.

Conclusion: CoHalLo effectively localizes hallucinated code lines at a fine-grained level, enhancing the reliability and practicality of AI-generated code debugging.

Abstract: The localization of code hallucinations aims to identify specific lines of code containing hallucinations, helping developers to improve the reliability of AI-generated code more efficiently. Although recent studies have adopted several methods to detect code hallucination, most of these approaches remain limited to coarse-grained detection and lack specialized techniques for fine-grained hallucination localization. This study introduces a novel method, called CoHalLo, which achieves line-level code hallucination localization by probing the hidden-layer vectors from hallucination detection models. CoHalLo uncovers the key syntactic information driving the model's hallucination judgments and locates the hallucinating code lines accordingly. Specifically, we first fine-tune the hallucination detection model on manually annotated datasets to ensure that it learns features pertinent to code syntactic information. Subsequently, we designed a probe network that projects high-dimensional latent vectors onto a low-dimensional syntactic subspace, generating vector tuples and reconstructing the predicted abstract syntax tree (P-AST). By comparing P-AST with the original abstract syntax tree (O-AST) extracted from the input AI-generated code, we identify the key syntactic structures associated with hallucinations. This information is then used to pinpoint hallucinated code lines. To evaluate CoHalLo's performance, we manually collected a dataset of code hallucinations. The experimental results show that CoHalLo achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 0.4253, Top-3 accuracy of 0.6149, Top-5 accuracy of 0.7356, Top-10 accuracy of 0.8333, IFA of 5.73, Recall@1% Effort of 0.052721, and Effort@20% Recall of 0.155269, which outperforms the baseline methods.

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) tools on blind and low-vision software professionals (BLVSPs), highlighting both productivity benefits and unique accessibility challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of research on how BLVSPs interact with Generative AI tools in the software development industry, given their growing prominence and potential for enhancing accessibility.

Method: The research involved conducting 39 semi-structured interviews with BLVSPs to understand their experiences with GenAI in their professional work.

Result: BLVSPs reported using GenAI for various software tasks, which increased productivity and accessibility. However, they faced challenges such as vulnerability to AI hallucinations and organizational restrictions on usage.

Conclusion: While GenAI presents significant opportunities for BLVSPs, its adoption requires careful consideration of associated risks, especially with regard to reliability and policy barriers.

Abstract: The software development workplace poses numerous technical and collaborative accessibility challenges for blind and low vision software professionals (BLVSPs). Though Generative AI (GenAI) is increasingly adopted within the software development industry and has been a rapidly growing topic of interest in research, to date, the unique perspectives of BLVSPs have yet to be consulted. We report on a qualitative study involving 39 semi-structured interviews with BLVSPs about what the introduction of GenAI has meant for their work. We found that BLVSPs used GenAI for many software development tasks, resulting in benefits such as increased productivity and accessibility. However, significant costs were also accompanied by GenAI use as they were more vulnerable to hallucinations than their sighted colleagues. Sometimes, organizational policies prevented use. Based on our findings, we discuss the higher-risks and higher-returns that BLVSPs had to carefully weigh when deciding whether and when to use GenAI tools for work.

Using a dataset of repaired codes, various techniques are evaluated for their ability to assign probabilities to editable regions. White-box probing outperforms other methods in estimating edited lines in LLM-generated programs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of misalignment in source code generated by LLMs, which often requires user intervention and editing.

Method: The authors create a dataset called "Minimal Intent Aligning Patches" and measure the calibration of different techniques for locating misaligned code. They compare white-box probing, black-box reflective, and self-consistency-based techniques.

Result: White-box probing, supported by a smaller supervisor model, achieves low calibration error and a Brier Skill Score of approximately 0.2. The probe demonstrates signs of generalizability, even extending to some language errors in natural text.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques, notably white-box probing, effectively detect misaligned code, paving the way for advanced AI oversight and potential applications beyond programming contexts.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) can generate complicated source code from natural language prompts. However, LLMs can generate output that deviates from what the user wants, requiring supervision and editing. To support this process, we offer techniques to localize where generations might be misaligned from user intent. We first create a dataset of "Minimal Intent Aligning Patches" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger. We discuss the generalizability of the techniques, and the connections to AI oversight and control, finding a probe trained only on code shows some signs of generalizing to natural language errors if new probability scaling is allowed.

*Shiqi Kuang,Zhao Tian,Tao Xiao,Dong Wang,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study evaluates the effectiveness of five training data optimization techniques and their combinations for LLM-based code generation, revealing key insights into their impact on functional correctness, code quality, and maintainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation of training data optimization techniques for improving LLM-driven code generation.

Method: Conducted a large-scale empirical study across three benchmarks and four LLMs, testing five optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations.

Result: Data synthesis was the most effective for functional correctness and reducing code smells but underperformed in maintainability. Data synthesis combined with refactoring showed the best overall performance.

Conclusion: This work provides the first comprehensive understanding of training data optimization techniques and their combinations, with practical recommendations for improving code generation by LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, largely driven by the availability of high-quality code datasets for effective training. To further improve data quality, numerous training data optimization techniques have been proposed; however, their overall effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study, examining five widely-used training data optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations for LLM-based code generation across three benchmarks and four LLMs. Our results show that data synthesis is the most effective technique for improving functional correctness and reducing code smells, although it performs relatively worse on code maintainability compared to data refactoring, cleaning, and selection. Regarding combinations, we find that most combinations do not further improve functional correctness but can effectively enhance code quality (code smells and maintainability). Among all combinations, data synthesis combined with data refactoring achieves the strongest overall performance. Furthermore, our fine-grained analysis reinforces these findings and provides deeper insights into how individual techniques and their combinations influence code generation effectiveness. Overall, this work represents a first step toward a systematic understanding of training data optimization and combination strategies, offering practical guidance for future research and deployment in LLM-based code generation.

*Zhongyi Wang,Tengjie Lin,Mingshuai Chen,Haokun Li,Mingqi Yang,Xiao Yi,Shengchao Qin,Yixing Luo,Xiaofeng Li,Bin Gu,Liqiang Lu,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework, Preguss, which enhances formal verification in large software/hardware systems using a divide-and-conquer approach leveraging static analysis and language models. It significantly improves automation and reduces manual verification effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving fully automated formal verification for large-scale systems is challenging due to issues like context limitations and complexity in generating interprocedural specifications in current methods.

Method: Preguss employs a modular framework where static analysis and deductive verification are integrated. It uses two main components: runtime error-guided prioritization of verification units and language model-driven synthesis of interprocedural specifications.

Result: Preguss outperforms existing LLM-based approaches, enabling verification for real-world programs with over a thousand lines of code. It reduces human effort by 80.6% to 88.9% in runtime error verification.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Preguss provides significant advancements in automating and scaling formal verification processes, particularly in reducing manual efforts for real-world software verification tasks.

Abstract: Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort.

TL;DR: This study examines performance-related pull requests by AI agents using LLM-assisted detection and BERTopic-based modeling, identifying diverse optimization patterns and their acceptance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how AI agents address software performance concerns and their effectiveness in practice.

Method: Utilize LLM-assisted detection and BERTopic-based topic modeling to identify and group performance-related topics in pull requests.

Result: Identified 52 performance-related topics grouped into 10 categories, showing AI optimizations across software layers and discovering trends in optimization acceptance rates and review times.

Conclusion: Provides insights into AI agents' performance optimization behaviors and their implications for development and review processes.

Abstract: LLM-based software engineering is influencing modern software development. In addition to correctness, prior studies have also examined the performance of software artifacts generated by AI agents. However, it is unclear how exactly the agentic AI systems address performance concerns in practice. In this paper, we present an empirical study of performance-related pull requests generated by AI agents. Using LLM-assisted detection and BERTopic-based topic modeling, we identified 52 performance-related topics grouped into 10 higher-level categories. Our results show that AI agents apply performance optimizations across diverse layers of the software stack and that the type of optimization significantly affects pull request acceptance rates and review times. We also found that performance optimization by AI agents primarily occurs during the development phase, with less focus on the maintenance phase. Our findings provide empirical evidence that can support the evaluation and improvement of agentic AI systems with respect to their performance optimization behaviors and review outcomes.

### [368] [DynaFix: Iterative Automated Program Repair Driven by Execution-Level Dynamic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24635)
*Zhili Huang,Ling Xu,Chao Liu,Weifeng Sun,Xu Zhang,Yan Lei,Meng Yan,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DynaFix, a method for automated program repair (APR) that uses iterative execution-level dynamic information to improve patch generation, achieving a 10% improvement over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing APR methods struggle with limitations such as reliance on static analysis, limited use of dynamic signals, and coarse-grained feedback from program execution. These limitations lead to ineffective debugging, particularly for complex and multi-step bug repairs.

Method: DynaFix iteratively collects and incorporates fine-grained dynamic execution information (e.g., variable states, control-flow paths, call stacks) into structured prompts for large language models to refine patch generation. Failed patches trigger re-execution and new feedback loops.

Result: DynaFix successfully repaired 186 single-function bugs on Defects4J benchmarks, improving repair rates by 10%, solving 38 previously unrepaired cases, and reducing the patch search space by 70% while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The study concludes that leveraging dynamic execution information iteratively enables more effective and efficient APR, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and simulating human-like debugging practices.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate correct patches for buggy programs. Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.
  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.

*Tanjum Motin Mitul,Md. Masud Mazumder,Md Nahidul Islam Opu,Shaiful Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the energy awareness of AI coding agents in software development, analyzing their generated pull requests for energy-conscious optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy concerns are becoming vital in software development due to energy-intensive operations like large data centers and resource-constrained devices.

Method: Using a dataset of 216 agent-authored pull requests mentioning energy-related aspects, the authors performed a thematic analysis and categorized energy-aware practices and techniques.

Result: AI coding agents show encouraging energy awareness aligning with research-based optimization methods; however, their energy-efficient PRs face lower acceptance, mainly due to maintainability concerns.

Conclusion: Although AI agents demonstrate energy awareness in their outputs, the acceptance rate of energy-efficient optimizations is hindered by trade-offs with software maintainability.

Abstract: As Software Engineering enters its new era (SE 3.0), AI coding agents increasingly automate software development workflows. However, it remains unclear how exactly these agents recognize and address software energy concerns-an issue growing in importance due to large-scale data centers, energy-hungry language models, and battery-constrained devices. In this paper, we examined the energy awareness of agent-authored pull requests (PRs) using a publicly available dataset. We identified 216 energy-explicit PRs and conducted a thematic analysis, deriving a taxonomy of energy-aware work. Our further analysis of the applied optimization techniques shows that most align with established research recommendations. Although building and running these agents is highly energy intensive, encouragingly, the results indicate that they exhibit energy awareness when generating software artifacts. However, optimization-related PRs are accepted less frequently than others, largely due to their negative impact on maintainability.

*Mir Mohammad Yousuf,Shabir Ahmad Sofi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study analyzes software defects in 123 quantum computing repositories from 2012 to 2024, revealing patterns, root causes, and defect trends to guide improvements in quantum software engineering (QSE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify how defects emerge, evolve, and affect real-world quantum-classical system quality, addressing the limited empirical evidence for quantum software engineering.

Method: A mixed-method approach involving repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a rule-based classification framework was applied to analyze 32,296 bug reports across eight quantum software categories.

Result: Full-stack libraries and compilers are the most defect-prone, with bugs in circuit and transpilation processes. Automated testing reduces defect numbers by about 60%, while ecosystem defect densities peaked from 2017 to 2021 but declined due to ecosystem maturation.

Conclusion: The study highlights automated testing's crucial role in improving defect detection and resolution speed, providing actionable insights for enhancing testing, documentation, and maintainability in QSE.

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is essential for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of hybrid quantum-classical systems, yet empirical evidence on how bugs emerge and affect quality in real-world quantum projects remains limited. This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software defects across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most defect-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with defect densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity defects cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more defects and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected defect incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software defects and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.

*Ke Ma,Jianjun Huang,Wei You,Bin Liang,Jingzheng Wu,Yanjun Wu,Yuanjun Gong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces MATUS, a method to enhance bug detection accuracy by reducing noise interference in target codes, through similarity measurement and feature slicing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in precise bug detection caused by noise interference from unrelated code statements in existing methodologies.

Method: MATUS mitigates target noise by extracting feature slices from buggy and target codes, guided by prior knowledge of buggy code, to highlight semantic features for comparison using vector similarity.

Result: MATUS successfully identifies 31 unknown bugs in the Linux kernel, with 11 assigned CVEs, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting bugs in real-world projects.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves the accuracy and efficiency of bug detection by addressing noise interference, showing promising results in practice.

Abstract: Measuring the function similarity to detect bugs is effective, but the statements unrelated to the bugs can impede the performance due to the noise interference. Suppressing the noise interference in existing works does not manage the tough job, i.e., eliminating the noise in the targets. In this paper, we propose MATUS to mitigate the target noise for precise bug detection based on similarity measurement. Feature slices are extracted from both the buggy query and the targets to represent the semantic feature of (potential) bug logics. In particular, MATUS guides the target slicing with the prior knowledge from the buggy code, in an end-to-end way to pinpoint the slicing criterion in the targets. All feature slices are embedded and compared based on the vector similarity. Buggy candidates are audited to confirm unknown bugs in the targets. Experiments show that MATUS holds advantages in bug detection for real-world projects with acceptable efficiency. In total, MATUS has spotted 31 unknown bugs in the Linux kernel. All of them have been confirmed by the kernel developers, and 11 have been assigned CVEs.

*Zhiyong Zhang,Xiaoyan Zhang,Xiaoqi Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses the design of a high-concurrency railway ticketing system using microservice architecture and Spring Cloud, emphasizing security, stability, and high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing railway ticketing systems struggle to meet peak user demand during high-concurrency periods due to insufficient fault tolerance and limited capabilities.

Method: The system uses B/S architecture and Spring Cloud, integrates multiple middleware components, and incorporates various security design methods for ensuring stability, reliability, and data consistency under high concurrency.

Result: The developed system supports real-time inquiries, seat selection, ticket purchasing, and payment, addressing offline ticketing flaws, while testing confirmed its stability and performance under high-concurrency scenarios.

Conclusion: The railway ticketing system successfully achieves stability, high performance, and security through its well-structured architecture, catering effectively to user demands during peak periods.

Abstract: The railway ticketing system is one of the most important public service infrastructure. In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the "add passenger" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.

TL;DR: The paper integrates Bayesian inference and spiking neural networks to enable biologically plausible Bayesian computation using spike-timing-dependent plasticity, with results closely matching numerical solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between Bayesian inference frameworks (used for brain function modeling) and spike-based neural activity in the brain.

Method: The paper employs spiking neural networks performing Bayesian inference using message passing for Bernoulli messages. Training is based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity, a biologically realistic Hebbian learning mechanism.

Result: The proposed spiking neural networks closely replicate numerical solutions of Bayesian inference problems and demonstrate adaptability through a factor graph example from coding theory.

Conclusion: This study offers a framework for implementing Bayesian inference in biologically realistic spiking neural networks, expanding their applicability to problems like signal transmission over unreliable channels.

Abstract: Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for understanding brain function, while neural activity in the brain is inherently spike-based. This paper bridges these two perspectives by designing spiking neural networks that simulate Bayesian inference through message passing for Bernoulli messages. To train the networks, we employ spike-timing-dependent plasticity, a biologically plausible mechanism for synaptic plasticity which is based on the Hebbian rule. Our results demonstrate that the network's performance closely matches the true numerical solution. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by implementing a factor graph example from coding theory, illustrating signal transmission over an unreliable channel.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a unified, domain-agnostic framework for evaluating sequence learning across fields and connecting experiments to formal computation theories.

Method: Developed SymSeq for generating/analyzing symbolic sequences and SeqBench for benchmarking performance in rule-based sequence tasks, based on Formal Language Theory.

Result: Provides versatile tools enabling researchers to analyze and standardize experiments in domains such as psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, neuromorphic computing, and AI.

Conclusion: SymSeqBench enhances cognitive and behavioral research by offering modular, accessible tools to frame studies using shared computational principles.

Abstract: Sequential structure is a key feature of multiple domains of natural cognition and behavior, such as language, movement and decision-making. Likewise, it is also a central property of tasks to which we would like to apply artificial intelligence. It is therefore of great importance to develop frameworks that allow us to evaluate sequence learning and processing in a domain agnostic fashion, whilst simultaneously providing a link to formal theories of computation and computability. To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms. The tool is modular, openly available and accessible to the research community.

*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper identifies a fundamental norm mismatch in Fitted Q-evaluation (FQE) for off-policy evaluation and proposes a density ratio-based reweighting strategy to align FQE with the contraction norm of the Bellman operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability and accuracy of FQE in contexts where Bellman completeness and realizability cannot be guaranteed, addressing the challenges of norm mismatch and error blow-up.

Method: The authors propose reweighting the regression steps of FQE using an estimate of the stationary density ratio, aligning it with the contraction norm of the Bellman operator under the target policy's stationary distribution.

Result: FQE can achieve strong evaluation guarantees without the need for Bellman completeness or realizability, avoiding significant error accumulation while retaining its practical applicability.

Conclusion: By addressing norm mismatch through density ratio-based reweighting, the paper improves FQE's effectiveness in off-policy evaluation, making it feasible in settings with relaxed assumptions on completeness and realizability.

Abstract: Fitted Q-evaluation (FQE) is a central method for off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, but it generally requires Bellman completeness: that the hypothesis class is closed under the evaluation Bellman operator. This requirement is challenging because enlarging the hypothesis class can worsen completeness. We show that the need for this assumption stems from a fundamental norm mismatch: the Bellman operator is gamma-contractive under the stationary distribution of the target policy, whereas FQE minimizes Bellman error under the behavior distribution. We propose a simple fix: reweight each regression step using an estimate of the stationary density ratio, thereby aligning FQE with the norm in which the Bellman operator contracts. This enables strong evaluation guarantees in the absence of realizability or Bellman completeness, avoiding the geometric error blow-up of standard FQE in this setting while maintaining the practicality of regression-based evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper extends Tweedie’s formula to elliptical distributions, derives an alternative view using energy scores, and explores various applications including score estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the classical Tweedie’s formula to a broader domain of distributions (elliptical distributions) and derive a new identity for energy scores to broaden their utility.

Method: The authors derive a fundamental identity linking energy score derivatives to noisy marginal scores, offering an alternative to Tweedie’s formula for energy models.

Result: The extended Tweedie’s identity and the newly derived energy score identity hold practical applications, including leveraging energy scores in diffusion model samplers and estimating scores or noise parameters.

Conclusion: The work generalizes Tweedie's formula and provides a robust framework for score estimation and applications in energy models and diffusion processes.

Abstract: Denoising and score estimation have long been known to be linked via the classical Tweedie's formula. In this work, we first extend the latter to a wider range of distributions often called "energy models" and denoted elliptical distributions in this work. Next, we examine an alternative view: we consider the denoising posterior $P(X|Y)$ as the optimizer of the energy score (a scoring rule) and derive a fundamental identity that connects the (path-) derivative of a (possibly) non-Euclidean energy score to the score of the noisy marginal. This identity can be seen as an analog of Tweedie's identity for the energy score, and allows for several interesting applications; for example, score estimation, noise distribution parameter estimation, as well as using energy score models in the context of "traditional" diffusion model samplers with a wider array of noising distributions.

*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses instability in soft FQI due to geometric mismatch under function approximation and introduces stationary-reweighted soft FQI for improved stability and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft FQI suffers instability in function approximation due to local contractive issues under the soft Bellman operator and distribution mismatches.

Method: The paper reweights regression updates using the stationary distribution of the current policy, proving local linear convergence and suggesting gradual reduction of softmax temperature for global convergence.

Result: The proposed stationary-reweighted soft FQI achieves stability and local convergence under function approximation while showing potential for global convergence strategies.

Conclusion: Stationary-reweighted soft FQI improves contraction properties and can stabilize entropy-regularized offline RL methods even under function approximation.

Abstract: Fitted Q-iteration (FQI) and its entropy-regularized variant, soft FQI, are central tools for value-based model-free offline reinforcement learning, but can behave poorly under function approximation and distribution shift. In the entropy-regularized setting, we show that the soft Bellman operator is locally contractive in the stationary norm of the soft-optimal policy, rather than in the behavior norm used by standard FQI. This geometric mismatch explains the instability of soft Q-iteration with function approximation in the absence of Bellman completeness. To restore contraction, we introduce stationary-reweighted soft FQI, which reweights each regression update using the stationary distribution of the current policy. We prove local linear convergence under function approximation with geometrically damped weight-estimation errors, assuming approximate realizability. Our analysis further suggests that global convergence may be recovered by gradually reducing the softmax temperature, and that this continuation approach can extend to the hardmax limit under a mild margin condition.

### [378] [Implicit geometric regularization in flow matching via density weighted Stein operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23956)
*Shinto Eguchi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces $γ$-Flow Matching ($γ$-FM), a density-weighted improvement to Flow Matching, addressing inefficiencies in high-dimensional spaces by dynamically estimating target densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Flow Matching encounters inefficiencies in high-dimensional spaces due to its reliance on unweighted $L^2$ regression, which prioritizes regions with low-density where velocity fields are chaotic.

Method: The $γ$-Flow Matching ($γ$-FM) strategy incorporates density weighting directly into Flow Matching using Dynamic Density-Weighting, avoiding reliance on intractable target density evaluations and modifying the regression geometry.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows $γ$-FM minimizes transport cost with a $γ$-Stein metric and introduces implicit Sobolev regularization, while empirical studies demonstrate improved vector field smoothness, sampling efficiency, and robustness to outliers.

Conclusion: $γ$-FM successfully addresses inefficiencies in continuous normalizing flows for high-dimensional spaces, enhancing both theoretical transport cost metrics and practical empirical performance.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for continuous normalizing flows, yet standard FM implicitly performs an unweighted $L^2$ regression over the entire ambient space. In high dimensions, this leads to a fundamental inefficiency: the vast majority of the integration domain consists of low-density ``void'' regions where the target velocity fields are often chaotic or ill-defined. In this paper, we propose {$γ$-Flow Matching ($γ$-FM)}, a density-weighted variant that aligns the regression geometry with the underlying probability flow. While density weighting is desirable, naive implementations would require evaluating the intractable target density. We circumvent this by introducing a Dynamic Density-Weighting strategy that estimates the \emph{target} density directly from training particles. This approach allows us to dynamically downweight the regression loss in void regions without compromising the simulation-free nature of FM. Theoretically, we establish that $γ$-FM minimizes the transport cost on a statistical manifold endowed with the $γ$-Stein metric. Spectral analysis further suggests that this geometry induces an implicit Sobolev regularization, effectively damping high-frequency oscillations in void regions. Empirically, $γ$-FM significantly improves vector field smoothness and sampling efficiency on high-dimensional latent datasets, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to outliers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop tools for effectively approximating and understanding stochastic processes, particularly for applications such as predicting COVID-19 cases.

Method: The authors construct SINNOs with sigmoidal activation functions, establish their boundedness and interpolation accuracy, and provide error estimates based on the continuity modulus.

Result: SINNOs are effective in approximating second-order stochastic processes, supported by error quantifications and probabilistic consistency.

Conclusion: SINNOs show promising capabilities in approximating stochastic processes, presenting potential for predictions in practical scenarios like COVID-19 case forecasting.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a class of stochastic interpolation neural network operators (SINNOs) with random coefficients activated by sigmoidal functions. We establish their boundedness, interpolation accuracy, and approximation capabilities in the mean square sense, in probability, as well as path-wise within the space of second-order stochastic (random) processes \( L^2(Ω, \mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}) \). Additionally, we provide quantitative error estimates using the modulus of continuity of the processes. These results highlight the effectiveness of SINNOs for approximating stochastic processes with potential applications in COVID-19 case prediction.

### [380] [Topological Spatial Graph Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24327)
*Anna Calissano,Etienne Lasalle*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a parameter-free approach to reduce spatial graphs while preserving their topological features by introducing a triangle-aware graph filtration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of reducing spatial graphs while maintaining their key topological and structural features, which is valuable in applications involving spatial data like public transport networks or biological structures.

Method: The method involves collapsing short edges in spatial graphs using a parameter-free coarsening approach, guided by topological descriptors created through a novel triangle-aware graph filtration.

Result: The method significantly reduces the size of spatial graphs while maintaining relevant topological information, as demonstrated using synthetic and real-world graphs.

Conclusion: This paper presents an effective parameter-free framework for spatial graph reduction that preserves essential topological features and is invariant to transformations like rotation, translation, and scaling.

Abstract: Spatial graphs are particular graphs for which the nodes are localized in space (e.g., public transport network, molecules, branching biological structures). In this work, we consider the problem of spatial graph reduction, that aims to find a smaller spatial graph (i.e., with less nodes) with the same overall structure as the initial one. In this context, performing the graph reduction while preserving the main topological features of the initial graph is particularly relevant, due to the additional spatial information. Thus, we propose a topological spatial graph coarsening approach based on a new framework that finds a trade-off between the graph reduction and the preservation of the topological characteristics. The coarsening is realized by collapsing short edges. In order to capture the topological information required to calibrate the reduction level, we adapt the construction of classical topological descriptors made for point clouds (the so-called persistent diagrams) to spatial graphs. This construction relies on the introduction of a new filtration called triangle-aware graph filtration. Our coarsening approach is parameter-free and we prove that it is equivariant under rotations, translations and scaling of the initial spatial graph. We evaluate the performances of our method on synthetic and real spatial graphs, and show that it significantly reduces the graph sizes while preserving the relevant topological information.

*Jiani Wei,Xiaocheng Shang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper refines the original CCAdL thermostat in stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics for Bayesian sampling by introducing a modified version (mCCAdL) to enhance stability and accuracy in large-scale machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address instability and limited performance in the numerical integration method used in the CCAdL thermostat for stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.

Method: Developed a modified CCAdL (mCCAdL) thermostat using scaling and squaring method with truncated Taylor series and proposed a symmetric splitting method for numerical integration.

Result: The mCCAdL thermostat achieves better numerical stability and accuracy compared to the original CCAdL and other stochastic gradient methods in large-scale machine learning.

Conclusion: The mCCAdL thermostat improves stability and computational performance, making it a superior alternative for large-scale Bayesian sampling tasks in machine learning applications.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and its variants approximate the likelihood of an entire dataset, via random (and typically much smaller) subsets, in the setting of Bayesian sampling. Due to the (often substantial) improvement of the computational efficiency, they have been widely used in large-scale machine learning applications. It has been demonstrated that the so-called covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin (CCAdL) thermostat, which incorporates an additional term involving the covariance matrix of the noisy force, outperforms popular alternative methods. A moving average is used in CCAdL to estimate the covariance matrix of the noisy force, in which case the covariance matrix will converge to a constant matrix in long-time limit. Moreover, it appears in our numerical experiments that the use of a moving average could reduce the stability of the numerical integrators, thereby limiting the largest usable stepsize. In this article, we propose a modified CCAdL (i.e., mCCAdL) thermostat that uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential to numerically approximate the exact solution to the subsystem involving the additional term proposed in CCAdL. We also propose a symmetric splitting method for mCCAdL, instead of an Euler-type discretisation used in the original CCAdL thermostat. We demonstrate in our numerical experiments that the newly proposed mCCAdL thermostat achieves a substantial improvement in the numerical stability over the original CCAdL thermostat, while significantly outperforming popular alternative stochastic gradient methods in terms of the numerical accuracy for large-scale machine learning applications.

### [382] [MultiRisk: Multiple Risk Control via Iterative Score Thresholding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24587)
*Sunay Joshi,Yan Sun,Hamed Hassani,Edgar Dobriban*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic programming solution for regulating generative AI behavior based on multiple user-defined risk constraints, with effectiveness validated on a multi-constraint Large Language Model alignment task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of generative AI in applications necessitates effective control of model behavior to adhere to safety and performance standards across multiple dimensions.

Method: The authors propose test-time filtering using two dynamic programming algorithms (MULTIRISK-BASE and MULTIRISK) to enforce prioritized risk constraints. MULTIRISK leverages data exchangeability for simultaneous risk control.

Result: Their methods achieve near-optimal risk control and are validated through experiments on a multi-constraint alignment task using the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, demonstrating that individual risks can be maintained close to target levels.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively manages multiple prioritized risk constraints in generative AI outputs, providing a feasible and efficient mechanism for behavior control in real-world applications.

Abstract: As generative AI systems are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, regulating multiple dimensions of model behavior has become essential. We focus on test-time filtering: a lightweight mechanism for behavior control that compares performance scores to estimated thresholds, and modifies outputs when these bounds are violated. We formalize the problem of enforcing multiple risk constraints with user-defined priorities, and introduce two efficient dynamic programming algorithms that leverage this sequential structure. The first, MULTIRISK-BASE, provides a direct finite-sample procedure for selecting thresholds, while the second, MULTIRISK, leverages data exchangeability to guarantee simultaneous control of the risks. Under mild assumptions, we show that MULTIRISK achieves nearly tight control of all constraint risks. The analysis requires an intricate iterative argument, upper bounding the risks by introducing several forms of intermediate symmetrized risk functions, and carefully lower bounding the risks by recursively counting jumps in symmetrized risk functions between appropriate risk levels. We evaluate our framework on a three-constraint Large Language Model alignment task using the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, where the goal is to maximize helpfulness subject to multiple safety constraints, and where scores are generated by a Large Language Model judge and a perplexity filter. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can control each individual risk at close to the target level.

### [383] [Sparse Offline Reinforcement Learning with Corruption Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24768)
*Nam Phuong Tran,Andi Nika,Goran Radanovic,Long Tran-Thanh,Debmalya Mandal*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses strong data corruption issues in offline sparse reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging sparsity in high-dimensional settings to improve robustness and policy estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable effective learning of near-optimal policies in high-dimensional sparse RL settings under adversarial corruption, as traditional approaches have limitations in this regime.

Method: The authors identify challenges with LSVI in offline RL with sparsity and propose actor-critic methods combined with sparse robust estimators to overcome these limitations.

Result: They establish the first rigorous guarantees for sparse high-dimensional MDPs with single-policy concentrability and demonstrate robustness under strong data contamination.

Conclusion: Learning a near-optimal policy in high-dimensional sparse MDPs is achievable, even under adversarial corruption, using their proposed sparse robust actor-critic methods.

Abstract: We investigate robustness to strong data corruption in offline sparse reinforcement learning (RL). In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.

### [384] [Are First-Order Diffusion Samplers Really Slower? A Fast Forward-Value Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24927)
*Yuchen Jiao,Na Li,Changxiao Cai,Gen Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study proposes a novel first-order diffusion probabilistic model sampler that improves sampling accuracy by addressing evaluation placement, challenging the belief that only higher-order methods enhance speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore alternatives to higher-order ODE solvers for diffusion probabilistic model sampling, especially in scenarios with low neural function evaluations (NFEs), and to understand the impact of evaluation placement on sampling accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces a training-free, first-order sampler which uses a one-step lookahead predictor to approximate forward evaluations. It features a discretization error counteracting that of DDIM, ensuring first-order convergence while closely approximating the forward-value trajectory.

Result: The proposed first-order sampler outperforms existing methods in terms of sample quality across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, LSUN) under the same NFE budget. It achieves results comparable to and sometimes better than state-of-the-art higher-order samplers.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that adjusting DPM evaluation placement can significantly enhance sampling efficiency independently of solver order, presenting a promising direction for further advancements in diffusion probabilistic models.

Abstract: Higher-order ODE solvers have become a standard tool for accelerating diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) sampling, motivating the widespread view that first-order methods are inherently slower and that increasing discretization order is the primary path to faster generation. This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime.
  We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores how to express the state of cellular automata systems analytically, focusing on solving the initial value problem to provide deeper understanding of their behavior.

Method: The authors analyze spatiotemporal patterns generated by elementary rule 156, decompose them into simpler segments, construct a solution formula, and calculate densities and probabilities of symbol blocks.

Result: The study successfully constructs a solution formula for elementary rule 156, calculates the density of ones, and derives probabilities of longer symbol blocks after multiple iterations.

Conclusion: The paper provides a methodology to solve the initial value problem in cellular automata, with practical application demonstrated for elementary rule 156.

Abstract: For many cellular automata, it is possible to express the state of a given cell after $n$ iterations as an explicit function of the initial configuration. We say that for such rules the solution of the initial value problem can be obtained. In some cases, one can construct the solution formula for the initial value problem by analyzing the spatiotemporal pattern generated by the rule and decomposing it into simpler segments which one can then describe algebraically. We show an example of a rule when such approach is successful, namely elementary rule 156. Solution of the initial value problem for this rule is constructed and then used to compute the density of ones after $n$ iterations, starting from a random initial condition. We also show how to obtain probabilities of occurrence of longer blocks of symbols.

*Eliot W. Robson,Abhishek K. Umrawal*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Community-IM++ is a framework for Influence Maximization that models cross-community influence, offering near-greedy spread with significantly lower runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing community-based IM methods improve scalability but ignore inter-community influence, which is critical for real-world applications.

Method: The proposed method partitions networks, uses a community-based diffusion degree (CDD) heuristic, and applies a progressive budgeting strategy with lazy evaluation to minimize redundancy.

Result: Community-IM++ achieves near-greedy influence spread while being up to 100x faster, outperforming other community-based approaches under different budgets and conditions.

Conclusion: Community-IM++ is effective and efficient for large-scale Influence Maximization tasks, making it suitable for applications like viral marketing and public health campaigns.

Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM) seeks to identify a small set of seed nodes in a social network to maximize expected information spread under a diffusion model. While community-based approaches improve scalability by exploiting modular structure, they typically assume independence between communities, overlooking inter-community influence$\unicode{x2014}$a limitation that reduces effectiveness in real-world networks. We introduce Community-IM++, a scalable framework that explicitly models cross-community diffusion through a principled heuristic based on community-based diffusion degree (CDD) and a progressive budgeting strategy. The algorithm partitions the network, computes CDD to prioritize bridging nodes, and allocates seeds adaptively across communities using lazy evaluation to minimize redundant computations. Experiments on large real-world social networks under different edge weight models show that Community-IM++ achieves near-greedy influence spread at up to 100 times lower runtime, while outperforming Community-IM and degree heuristics across budgets and structural conditions. These results demonstrate the practicality of Community-IM++ for large-scale applications such as viral marketing, misinformation control, and public health campaigns, where efficiency and cross-community reach are critical.

TL;DR: PhysTalk is a novel framework that merges 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and physical simulations for real-time, physics-based, interactive 4D animations from text inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of generating realistic animations from text inputs by overcoming the computational inefficiencies and lack of realism in current systems.

Method: PhysTalk directly integrates a large language model (LLM) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate physics-based animations, avoiding mesh extractions. The LLM creates code to manipulate 3DGS parameters in real-time with lightweight physics simulations.

Result: PhysTalk achieves real-time, physics-aware manipulation of multi-material 3D objects and renders interactive animations effectively, bypassing traditional slow workflows.

Conclusion: The introduction of PhysTalk enables a computationally lightweight and train-free solution for 4D animations, shifting animation workflows to interactive and physics-informed processes from traditional time-consuming methods.

Abstract: Realistic visual simulations are omnipresent, yet their creation requires computing time, rendering, and expert animation knowledge. Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential. However, current pipelines lack both physical realism and effective language interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes 4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows from a "render and wait" paradigm toward an interactive dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline.

TL;DR: AstroReview is an agent-based framework for automating telescope proposal reviews, achieving significant accuracy and quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical bottleneck in astronomy due to manual peer review of telescope proposals, which is time-consuming and lacks scalability.

Method: AstroReview automates proposal reviews through three stages: evaluating merit/novelty, feasibility/yield, and conducting meta-review/reliability checks, incorporating transparency measures.

Result: AstroReview achieved 87% accuracy in identifying accepted proposals and improved acceptance rates of revised drafts by 66% after two feedback iterations.

Conclusion: AstroReview successfully demonstrates a scalable pathway for efficient, fair, and transparent proposal review in astronomy, enhancing operational throughput.

Abstract: Competitive access to modern observatories has intensified as proposal volumes outpace available telescope time, making timely, consistent, and transparent peer review a critical bottleneck for the advancement of astronomy. Automating parts of this process is therefore both scientifically significant and operationally necessary to ensure fair allocation and reproducible decisions at scale. We present AstroReview, an open-source, agent-based framework that automates proposal review in three stages: (i) novelty and scientific merit, (ii) feasibility and expected yield, and (iii) meta-review and reliability verification. Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains. Together, these results point to a practical path toward scalable, auditable, and higher throughput proposal review for resource limited facilities.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the efficiency of generating samples from a tilted distribution using a self-normalized importance sampler and its challenges based on distribution type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating samples from tilted distributions is important in fields like finance, climate science, and rare event simulation, but it is challenging, especially when the original distribution is unknown.

Method: The authors study the asymptotic efficiency and accuracy of a self-normalized importance sampler, analyzing the relationship between the number of samples, tilt degree, and nature of the underlying distribution.

Result: The paper identifies a key dichotomy: for bounded distributions, sample requirements grow polynomially with the tilt, but for unbounded distributions, requirements increase at a super-polynomial rate.

Conclusion: The study highlights the varying complexities of tilting for bounded versus unbounded distributions, providing valuable insights for improving sampling methods under different conditions.

Abstract: Consider the task of generating samples from a tilted distribution of a random vector whose underlying distribution is unknown, but samples from it are available. This finds applications in fields such as finance and climate science, and in rare event simulation. In this article, we discuss the asymptotic efficiency of a self-normalized importance sampler of the tilted distribution. We provide a sharp characterization of its accuracy, given the number of samples and the degree of tilt. Our findings reveal a surprising dichotomy: while the number of samples needed to accurately tilt a bounded random vector increases polynomially in the tilt amount, it increases at a super polynomial rate for unbounded distributions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular scheme for score-based sampling using Stein score functions to achieve accurate results with strong log concave distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Score-based sampling methods have shown remarkable empirical success, yet require reliable Stein score functions across noise levels.

Method: The authors propose a modular design of forward trajectories ensuring strongly log concave distributions, enabling use of high-accuracy samplers.

Result: Novel guarantees are established on sampling accuracy for both uni-modal and multi-modal densities, with efficient polynomial dependence on error.

Conclusion: By converting score-based sampling to SLC sampling problems, the work achieves versatile accurate sampling using existing algorithms with concise theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Sampling based on score diffusions has led to striking empirical results, and has attracted considerable attention from various research communities. It depends on availability of (approximate) Stein score functions for various levels of additive noise. We describe and analyze a modular scheme that reduces score-based sampling to solving a short sequence of ``nice'' sampling problems, for which high-accuracy samplers are known. We show how to design forward trajectories such that both (a) the terminal distribution, and (b) each of the backward conditional distribution is defined by a strongly log concave (SLC) distribution. This modular reduction allows us to exploit \emph{any} SLC sampling algorithm in order to traverse the backwards path, and we establish novel guarantees with short proofs for both uni-modal and multi-modal densities. The use of high-accuracy routines yields $\varepsilon$-accurate answers, in either KL or Wasserstein distances, with polynomial dependence on $\log(1/\varepsilon)$ and $\sqrt{d}$ dependence on the dimension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate and improve methods for score function estimation that can adapt to intrinsic dimensionality in datasets.

Method: Leverages Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type inequalities to study implicit and denoising score matching, analyzing the convergence rates and their efficiency in estimating log-density Hessians.

Result: Proves implicit score matching adapts to intrinsic data structures and matches denoising score matching's convergence rates. Both methods avoid the curse of dimensionality in estimating log-density Hessians.

Conclusion: Implicit score matching is a competitive method for score function estimation and supports ODE-based sampler convergence for generative diffusion models.

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the score function using both implicit score matching and denoising score matching. Assuming that the data distribution exhibiting a low-dimensional structure, we prove that implicit score matching is able not only to adapt to the intrinsic dimension, but also to achieve the same rates of convergence as denoising score matching in terms of the sample size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both methods allow us to estimate log-density Hessians without the curse of dimensionality by simple differentiation. This justifies convergence of ODE-based samplers for generative diffusion models. Our approach is based on Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type inequalities relating weighted $L^2$-norms of smooth functions and their derivatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to better understand and establish connections between training algorithms and regularization effects via a simplified and comprehensive approach.

Method: The authors use 'basic inequalities' to upper bound the optimization objective relative to a reference point, linking iterations to a regularization effect through theoretical and experimental studies.

Result: The framework is applied to analyze algorithms like gradient descent, mirror descent, and others, showing both refined known results and new theoretical contributions through applications to generalized linear models and experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed inequalities serve as an effective tool for analyzing optimization and regularization, broadening understanding and enabling new insights into training dynamics and predictors.

Abstract: We introduce \textit{basic inequalities} for first-order iterative optimization algorithms, forming a simple and versatile framework that connects implicit and explicit regularization. While related inequalities appear in the literature, we isolate and highlight a specific form and develop it as a well-rounded tool for statistical analysis. Let $f$ denote the objective function to be optimized. Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $θ_0$ with current iterate $θ_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(θ_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $θ_0$, $θ_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function. We demonstrate this framework through analyses of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds. In addition to revisiting and refining known results on gradient descent, we provide new results for mirror descent with Bregman divergence projection, for generalized linear models trained by gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent, and for randomized predictors. We illustrate and supplement these theoretical findings with experiments on generalized linear models.

Result: Findings show educators have limited AI knowledge but express interest in applications like interactive content, personalized assessment, and lesson planning. Structural challenges such as lack of training, technical support, and infrastructure are highlighted.

Conclusion: Effective AI adoption in Brazilian education requires public policies, teacher training, and equitable access to technology. Ethical and inclusive practices should also be prioritized.

Abstract: This study examines the perceptions of Brazilian K-12 education teachers regarding the use of AI in education, specifically General Purpose AI. This investigation employs a quantitative analysis approach, extracting information from a questionnaire completed by 346 educators from various regions of Brazil regarding their AI literacy and use. Educators vary in their educational level, years of experience, and type of educational institution. The analysis of the questionnaires shows that although most educators had only basic or limited knowledge of AI (80.3\%), they showed a strong interest in its application, particularly for the creation of interactive content (80.6%), lesson planning (80.2%), and personalized assessment (68.6%). The potential of AI to promote inclusion and personalized learning is also widely recognized (65.5%). The participants emphasized the importance of discussing ethics and digital citizenship, reflecting on technological dependence, biases, transparency, and responsible use of AI, aligning with critical education and the development of conscious students. Despite enthusiasm for the pedagogical potential of AI, significant structural challenges were identified, including a lack of training (43.4%), technical support (41.9%), and limitations of infrastructure, such as low access to computers, reliable Internet connections, and multimedia resources in schools. The study shows that Brazil is still in a bottom-up model for AI integration, missing official curricula to guide its implementation and structured training for teachers and students. Furthermore, effective implementation of AI depends on integrated public policies, adequate teacher training, and equitable access to technology, promoting ethical, inclusive, and contextually grounded adoption of AI in Brazilian K-12 education.

### [395] [How Large Language Models Systematically Misrepresent American Climate Opinions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23889)
*Sola Kim,Jieshu Wang,Marco A. Janssen,John M. Anderies*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) represent diverse climate opinions in the U.S. and finds that LLMs tend to oversimplify and inaccurately predict opinions across intersectional identities, posing risks to fair policy-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used to understand public opinion, ensuring accurate representation across diverse and intersecting identities is critical, especially in contested domains like climate policy.

Method: The researchers compared AI-generated answers from six LLMs, prompted with demographic profiles of 978 respondents, to actual answers from a nationally representative climate opinion survey on 20 climate-related questions.

Result: LLMs were found to compress the diversity of climate opinions, inaccurately predicting levels of concern in demographic subgroups and applying uniform gender assumptions that misrepresented particular groups, such as Black Americans.

Conclusion: Reliance on LLMs for understanding public opinion without addressing intersectional inaccuracies could harm equitable and inclusive policy-making, particularly in critical areas such as climate governance.

Abstract: Federal agencies and researchers increasingly use large language models to analyze and simulate public opinion. When AI mediates between the public and policymakers, accuracy across intersecting identities becomes consequential; inaccurate group-level estimates can mislead outreach, consultation, and policy design. While research examines intersectionality in LLM outputs, no study has compared these outputs against real human responses across intersecting identities. Climate policy is one such domain, and this is particularly urgent for climate change, where opinion is contested and diverse. We investigate how LLMs represent intersectional patterns in U.S. climate opinions. We prompted six LLMs with profiles of 978 respondents from a nationally representative U.S. climate opinion survey and compared AI-generated responses to actual human answers across 20 questions. We find that LLMs appear to compress the diversity of American climate opinions, predicting less-concerned groups as more concerned and vice versa. This compression is intersectional: LLMs apply uniform gender assumptions that match reality for White and Hispanic Americans but misrepresent Black Americans, where actual gender patterns differ. These patterns, which may be invisible to standard auditing approaches, could undermine equitable climate governance.

### [396] [Statistical Guarantees in the Search for Less Discriminatory Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23943)
*Chris Hays,Ben Laufer,Solon Barocas,Manish Raghavan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to certify the search for 'less discriminatory algorithms' (LDAs) in decision-making models using an adaptive stopping algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address biases in high-stakes decision systems like employment, credit, and housing models by identifying equally performant yet less discriminatory alternatives.

Method: The authors formalized LDA search using an optimal stopping problem approach and developed an adaptive stopping algorithm to establish evidence of sufficient model exploration.

Result: The algorithm provides a high-probability upper bound on achievable gains from model search, allowing developers to justify their exploration efforts. Validation was performed using real-world datasets in credit, employment, and housing.

Conclusion: The framework ensures developers can systematically certify their efforts to find LDAs, contributing to ethical AI in decision-making systems.

Abstract: Recent scholarship has argued that firms building data-driven decision systems in high-stakes domains like employment, credit, and housing should search for "less discriminatory algorithms" (LDAs) (Black et al., 2024). That is, for a given decision problem, firms considering deploying a model should make a good-faith effort to find equally performant models with lower disparate impact across social groups. Evidence from the literature on model multiplicity shows that randomness in training pipelines can lead to multiple models with the same performance, but meaningful variations in disparate impact. This suggests that developers can find LDAs simply by randomly retraining models. Firms cannot continue retraining forever, though, which raises the question: What constitutes a good-faith effort? In this paper, we formalize LDA search via model multiplicity as an optimal stopping problem, where a model developer with limited information wants to produce strong evidence that they have sufficiently explored the space of models. Our primary contribution is an adaptive stopping algorithm that yields a high-probability upper bound on the gains achievable from a continued search, allowing the developer to certify (e.g., to a court) that their search was sufficient. We provide a framework under which developers can impose stronger assumptions about the distribution of models, yielding correspondingly stronger bounds. We validate the method on real-world credit, employment and housing datasets.

### [397] [AHA: Aligning Large Audio-Language Models for Reasoning Hallucinations via Counterfactual Hard Negatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24052)
*Yanxi Chen,Wenhui Zhu,Xiwen Chen,Zhipeng Wang,Xin Li,Peijie Qiu,Hao Wang,Xuanzhao Dong,Yujian Xiong,Anderson Schneider,Yuriy Nevmyvaka,Yalin Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces the AHA framework to address hallucinations in Large Audio-Language Models, enhancing grounding performance and achieving SOTA results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Audio-Language Models struggle with hallucinations, such as generating content ungrounded in audio inputs, affecting their reliability.

Method: The AHA framework utilizes counterfactual hard negative mining to create a preference dataset, combined with AHA-Eval benchmark to test fine-grained temporal reasoning.

Result: The refined Qwen-Audio-AHA model improves by 13.7% on AHA-Eval and achieves notable performance gains on public benchmarks (e.g., MMAU-Test and MMAR).

Conclusion: The proposed AHA framework and finetuned model effectively reduce hallucinations, improve temporal reasoning, and outperform the prior state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Although Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) deliver state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, they frequently suffer from hallucinations, e.g. generating text not grounded in the audio input. We analyze these grounding failures and identify a distinct taxonomy: Event Omission, False Event Identity, Temporal Relation Error, and Quantitative Temporal Error. To address this, we introduce the AHA (Audio Hallucination Alignment) framework. By leveraging counterfactual hard negative mining, our pipeline constructs a high-quality preference dataset that forces models to distinguish strict acoustic evidence from linguistically plausible fabrications. Additionally, we establish AHA-Eval, a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously test these fine-grained temporal reasoning capabilities. We apply this data to align Qwen2.5-Omni. The resulting model, Qwen-Audio-AHA, achieves a 13.7% improvement on AHA-Eval. Crucially, this benefit generalizes beyond our diagnostic set. Our model shows substantial gains on public benchmarks, including 1.3% on MMAU-Test and 1.6% on MMAR, outperforming latest SOTA methods.

*Roee Ziv,Raz Lapid,Moshe Sipper*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper presents an encoder-level adversarial attack targeting audio-language models, inducing specific outputs without needing access to the language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-language models enable advanced multimodal reasoning, but they also present vulnerabilities that can be exploited for security attacks.

Method: The proposed universal targeted latent space attack manipulates audio latent representations via a learned universal perturbation, bypassing the need for access to the language model.

Result: Experiments on Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct show high attack success rates while maintaining minimal perceptual distortion.

Conclusion: The study uncovers a critical attack surface at the encoder level of multimodal systems, highlighting the need for further research in securing such models.

Abstract: Audio-language models combine audio encoders with large language models to enable multimodal reasoning, but they also introduce new security vulnerabilities. We propose a universal targeted latent space attack, an encoder-level adversarial attack that manipulates audio latent representations to induce attacker-specified outputs in downstream language generation. Unlike prior waveform-level or input-specific attacks, our approach learns a universal perturbation that generalizes across inputs and speakers and does not require access to the language model. Experiments on Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct demonstrate consistently high attack success rates with minimal perceptual distortion, revealing a critical and previously underexplored attack surface at the encoder level of multimodal systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PhyAVBench, a benchmark for evaluating T2AV models' understanding of the physical principles of sound generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2AV models struggle to generate sound that adheres to physical principles, highlighting the need for better evaluation methods in this aspect.

Method: They propose PhyAVBench, featuring 1000 paired prompts with controlled physical variables designed to test T2AV models' audio-physics grounding capabilities via the Audio-Physics Sensitivity Test (APST).

Result: The benchmark provides 6 audio-physics dimensions, covers 4 scenarios, includes 50 fine-grained test points, and uses high-quality, human-refined prompts and videos.

Conclusion: PhyAVBench addresses a critical yet underexplored area, aiming to push the boundaries of physically-grounded T2AV model development.

Abstract: Text-to-audio-video (T2AV) generation underpins a wide range of applications demanding realistic audio-visual content, including virtual reality, world modeling, gaming, and filmmaking. However, existing T2AV models remain incapable of generating physically plausible sounds, primarily due to their limited understanding of physical principles. To situate current research progress, we present PhyAVBench, a challenging audio physics-sensitivity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the audio physics grounding capabilities of existing T2AV models. PhyAVBench comprises 1,000 groups of paired text prompts with controlled physical variables that implicitly induce sound variations, enabling a fine-grained assessment of models' sensitivity to changes in underlying acoustic conditions. We term this evaluation paradigm the Audio-Physics Sensitivity Test (APST). Unlike prior benchmarks that primarily focus on audio-video synchronization, PhyAVBench explicitly evaluates models' understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying sound generation, covering 6 major audio physics dimensions, 4 daily scenarios (music, sound effects, speech, and their mix), and 50 fine-grained test points, ranging from fundamental aspects such as sound diffraction to more complex phenomena, e.g., Helmholtz resonance. Each test point consists of multiple groups of paired prompts, where each prompt is grounded by at least 20 newly recorded or collected real-world videos, thereby minimizing the risk of data leakage during model pre-training. Both prompts and videos are iteratively refined through rigorous human-involved error correction and quality control to ensure high quality. We argue that only models with a genuine grasp of audio-related physical principles can generate physically consistent audio-visual content. We hope PhyAVBench will stimulate future progress in this critical yet largely unexplored domain.

*Mohsen Annabestani,Samira Aghadoost,Anais Rameau,Olivier Elemento,Gloria Chia-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning framework for classifying eight benign voice disorders and healthy controls, using features extracted from sustained vocal sounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of diagnosing benign laryngeal voice disorders, which impact many individuals and can serve as non-invasive indicators of broader physiological issues.

Method: The framework uses a three-stage machine learning pipeline, extracting acoustic features and mel-spectrograms to sequentially screen, stratify, and classify voice disorders using data from the Saarbruecken Voice Database.

Result: The system outperforms pre-trained models and flat classifiers, demonstrating improved accuracy for fine-grained classification of voice disorders.

Conclusion: This framework shows significant potential as a scalable, transparent, and non-invasive tool for early voice disorder detection, diagnostic triage, and monitoring of vocal health.

Abstract: Benign laryngeal voice disorders affect nearly one in five individuals and often manifest as dysphonia, while also serving as non-invasive indicators of broader physiological dysfunction. We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment. These results highlight the potential of quantitative voice biomarkers as scalable, non-invasive tools for early screening, diagnostic triage, and longitudinal monitoring of vocal health.

TL;DR: This paper presents an automated deep learning pipeline using Sentinel-1 SAR for monitoring high-risk Himalayan glacial lakes, achieving high efficacy with IoU of 0.9130.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing remote monitoring methods for detecting Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), including the struggles with cloud-based optical imagery and static mapping.

Method: Implemented a deep learning pipeline using a "temporal-first" strategy with a U-Net architecture (efficient EfficientNet-B3 backbone) trained on time-series Sentinel-1 SAR data, targeting specific high-risk lakes.

Result: Validated the model with an IoU of 0.9130, demonstrating the success of the approach, and developed a scalable early warning system architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances dynamic automated monitoring and early warning systems for GLOFs, offering scalability and improved hazard mitigation.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are one of the most devastating climate change induced hazards. Existing remote monitoring approaches often prioritise maximising spatial coverage to train generalistic models or rely on optical imagery hampered by persistent cloud coverage. This paper presents an end-to-end, automated deep learning pipeline for the targeted monitoring of high-risk Himalayan glacial lakes using time-series Sentinel-1 SAR. We introduce a "temporal-first" training strategy, utilising a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B3 backbone trained on a curated dataset of a cohort of 4 lakes (Tsho Rolpa, Chamlang Tsho, Tilicho and Gokyo Lake). The model achieves an IoU of 0.9130 validating the success and efficacy of the "temporal-first" strategy required for transitioning to Early Warning Systems. Beyond the model, we propose an operational engineering architecture: a Dockerised pipeline that automates data ingestion via the ASF Search API and exposes inference results via a RESTful endpoint. This system shifts the paradigm from static mapping to dynamic and automated early warning, providing a scalable architectural foundation for future development in Early Warning Systems.

*Xiangyu Chen,Jixiang Luo,Jingyu Xu,Fangqiu Yi,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Video Compression (GVC), achieving extreme video compression rates (as low as 0.02%) by using generative models, enabling high-quality video reconstruction from minimal data transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores whether video data can be compressed to an extreme degree (e.g., 0.01%) to address challenges in bandwidth-limited or resource-constrained scenarios, such as remote surveillance and emergency rescue.

Method: The GVC framework shifts computational load from transmission to inference by encoding video into compact forms and reconstructing it at the receiver using generative models. It incorporates a trade-off strategy to ensure efficient deployment on consumer-grade GPUs.

Result: GVC achieves extreme compression rates (0.02% in some cases) while maintaining high video quality. It also offers computational efficiency, supporting practical applications like remote surveillance or mobile edge computing.

Conclusion: GVC represents a novel, scalable video communication paradigm. It paves the way for effective video transmission in constrained environments, offering a balance between computation and compression. Practical deployment is validated through empirical tests.

Abstract: Whether a video can be compressed at an extreme compression rate as low as 0.01%? To this end, we achieve the compression rate as 0.02% at some cases by introducing Generative Video Compression (GVC), a new framework that redefines the limits of video compression by leveraging modern generative video models to achieve extreme compression rates while preserving a perception-centric, task-oriented communication paradigm, corresponding to Level C of the Shannon-Weaver model. Besides, How we trade computation for compression rate or bandwidth? GVC answers this question by shifting the burden from transmission to inference: it encodes video into extremely compact representations and delegates content reconstruction to the receiver, where powerful generative priors synthesize high-quality video from minimal transmitted information. Is GVC practical and deployable? To ensure practical deployment, we propose a compression-computation trade-off strategy, enabling fast inference on consume-grade GPUs. Within the AI Flow framework, GVC opens new possibility for video communication in bandwidth- and resource-constrained environments such as emergency rescue, remote surveillance, and mobile edge computing. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that GVC offers a viable path toward a new effective, efficient, scalable, and practical video communication paradigm.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the self-supervised model USF-MAE for first-trimester fetal heart view classification, achieving high performance compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of early detection of congenital heart disease using first-trimester fetal echocardiography, where variability, small heart structures, and low signal-to-noise ratios create obstacles for automated analysis.

Method: USF-MAE, a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model, is pretrained on 370,000 unlabeled images using masked autoencoding and fine-tuned on a dataset of fetal echocardiography images for view classification.

Result: USF-MAE outperformed baselines (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ViT-B/16) with an accuracy of 90.57%, precision of 91.15%, recall of 90.57%, and F1-score of 90.71%.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrated superior performance in identifying fetal heart views, showcasing potential for clinical applications without aggressive image preprocessing or region-of-interest cropping.

Abstract: Congenital heart disease remains the most common congenital anomaly and a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although first-trimester fetal echocardiography offers an opportunity for earlier detection, automated analysis at this stage is challenging due to small cardiac structures, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial inter-operator variability. In this work, we evaluate a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model, USF-MAE, for first-trimester fetal heart view classification. USF-MAE is pretrained using masked autoencoding modelling on more than 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images spanning over 40 anatomical regions and is subsequently fine-tuned for downstream classification. As a proof of concept, the pretrained Vision Transformer encoder was fine-tuned on an open-source dataset of 6,720 first-trimester fetal echocardiography images to classify five categories: aorta, atrioventricular flows, V sign, X sign, and Other. Model performance was benchmarked against supervised convolutional neural network baselines (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) model pretrained on natural images (ImageNet-1k). All models were trained and evaluated using identical preprocessing, data splits, and optimization protocols. On an independent test set, USF-MAE achieved the highest performance across all evaluation metrics, with 90.57% accuracy, 91.15% precision, 90.57% recall, and 90.71% F1-score. This represents an improvement of +2.03% in accuracy and +1.98% in F1-score compared with the strongest baseline, ResNet-18. The proposed approach demonstrated robust performance without reliance on aggressive image preprocessing or region-of-interest cropping and showed improved discrimination of non-diagnostic frames.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing multidimensional MRI data with limited task-specific or problem-specific training data.

Method: The approach includes a learned feature representation via encoder-decoder networks, style-based decoder designs, latent diffusion models, and new reconstruction algorithms integrating zero-shot self-supervised learning.

Result: The method outperformed state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques in accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping.

Conclusion: The paper presents a new learning-based strategy for MRI reconstruction, enabling enhanced performance with minimal data requirement for training.

Abstract: We present a new approach for representing and reconstructing multidimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Our method builds on a novel, learned feature-based image representation that disentangles different types of features, such as geometry and contrast, into distinct low-dimensional latent spaces, enabling better exploitation of feature correlations in multidimensional images and incorporation of pre-learned priors specific to different feature types for reconstruction. More specifically, the disentanglement was achieved via an encoderdecoder network and image transfer training using large public data, enhanced by a style-based decoder design. A latent diffusion model was introduced to impose stronger constraints on distinct feature spaces. New reconstruction formulations and algorithms were developed to integrate the learned representation with a zero-shot selfsupervised learning adaptation and subspace modeling. The proposed method has been evaluated on accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, without task-specific supervised training or fine-tuning. This work offers a new strategy for learning-based multidimensional image reconstruction where only limited data are available for problem-specific or task-specific training.

TL;DR: The study explores how reciprocal connections in neural networks influence complexity and phase-space dynamics. Partial symmetry suppresses complexity, whereas partial anti-symmetry amplifies it, impacting chaotic behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how partial symmetry in reciprocal neuron connections impacts neural dynamics, particularly phase-space complexity and chaotic behavior.

Method: Random recurrent neural networks are analyzed for reciprocal connection correlations and their influence on fixed points, dimensionality, Lyapunov exponents, and transient path lengths.

Result: Partial symmetry suppresses complexity and favors low-dimensional activity, while partial anti-symmetry amplifies complexity and promotes high-dimensional chaotic activity in network dynamics.

Conclusion: Reciprocal connection patterns have testable links to neural dynamics and functions. Positive correlations result in stable activity, while negative correlations lead to chaotic fluctuations.

Abstract: Neural circuits exhibit structured connectivity, including an overrepresentation of reciprocal connections between neuron pairs. Despite important advances, a full understanding of how such partial symmetry in connectivity shapes neural dynamics remains elusive. Here we ask how correlations between reciprocal connections in a random, recurrent neural network affect phase-space complexity, defined as the exponential proliferation rate (with network size) of the number of fixed points that accompanies the transition to chaotic dynamics. We find a striking pattern: partial anti-symmetry strongly amplifies complexity, while partial symmetry suppresses it. These opposing trends closely track changes in other measures of dynamical behavior, such as dimensionality, Lyapunov exponents, and transient path length, supporting the view that fixed-point structure is a key determinant of network dynamics. Thus, positive reciprocal correlations favor low-dimensional, slowly varying activity, whereas negative correlations promote high-dimensional, rapidly fluctuating chaotic activity. These results yield testable predictions about the link between connection reciprocity, neural dynamics and function.

TL;DR: LLMs applied to S&P 500 sector portfolio construction show varied performance based on market stability, excelling in stable periods but struggling in volatile ones. Hybrid AI approaches combining LLMs and classical methods offer promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how LLMs can aid quantitative sector-based portfolio construction and assess their reliability across different market conditions.

Method: LLMs selected and weighted stocks within S&P 500 sector indices. Performance was tested in stable and volatile market conditions and combined with standard portfolio optimization.

Result: LLM-weighted portfolios outperformed indices in stable markets but underperformed in volatile ones. Hybrid AI-classical methods boosted performance and consistency.

Conclusion: While LLMs enhance stock selection, their effectiveness varies by market condition. Hybrid AI frameworks can improve investment strategies through adaptive integration.

Abstract: This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) from leading providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI) can be applied to quantitative sector-based portfolio construction. We use LLMs to identify investable universes of stocks within S&P 500 sector indices and evaluate how their selections perform when combined with classical portfolio optimization methods. Each model was prompted to select and weight 20 stocks per sector, and the resulting portfolios were compared with their respective sector indices across two distinct out-of-sample periods: a stable market phase (January-March 2025) and a volatile phase (April-June 2025).
  Our results reveal a strong temporal dependence in LLM portfolio performance. During stable market conditions, LLM-weighted portfolios frequently outperformed sector indices on both cumulative return and risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio) measures. However, during the volatile period, many LLM portfolios underperformed, suggesting that current models may struggle to adapt to regime shifts or high-volatility environments underrepresented in their training data. Importantly, when LLM-based stock selection is combined with traditional optimization techniques, portfolio outcomes improve in both performance and consistency.
  This study contributes one of the first multi-model, cross-provider evaluations of generative AI algorithms in investment management. It highlights that while LLMs can effectively complement quantitative finance by enhancing stock selection and interpretability, their reliability remains market-dependent. The findings underscore the potential of hybrid AI-quantitative frameworks, integrating LLM reasoning with established optimization techniques, to produce more robust and adaptive investment strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the real-time data selection challenge in processing large and complex images produced by optical-readout TPCs in rare-event searches.

Method: Proposed a reconstruction-based anomaly-detection strategy using a convolutional autoencoder trained on pedestal images to detect and extract regions of interest in image data.

Result: The best configuration retains 93.0% of signal intensity while discarding 97.8% of the image area with a fast inference time of 25 ms per frame.

Conclusion: Pedestal-trained autoencoders demonstrate effective, scalable, and detector-agnostic solutions for online data reduction in optical TPCs, highlighting the critical role of training objective design.

Abstract: Optical-readout Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) produce megapixel-scale images whose fine-grained topological information is essential for rare-event searches, but whose size challenges real-time data selection. We present an unsupervised, reconstruction-based anomaly-detection strategy for fast Region-of-Interest (ROI) extraction that operates directly on minimally processed camera frames. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images learns the detector noise morphology without labels, simulation, or fine-grained calibration. Applied to standard data-taking frames, localized reconstruction residuals identify particle-induced structures, from which compact ROIs are extracted via thresholding and spatial clustering. Using real data from the CYGNO optical TPC prototype, we compare two pedestal-trained autoencoder configurations that differ only in their training objective, enabling a controlled study of its impact. The best configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with an inference time of approximately 25 ms per frame on a consumer GPU. The results demonstrate that careful design of the training objective is critical for effective reconstruction-based anomaly detection and that pedestal-trained autoencoders provide a transparent and detector-agnostic baseline for online data reduction in optical TPCs.

### [409] [Seeking Late Night Life Lines: Experiences of Conversational AI Use in Mental Health Crisis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23859)
*Leah Hope Ajmani,Arka Ghosh,Benjamin Kaveladze,Eugenia Kim,Keertana Namuduri,Theresa Nguyen,Ebele Okoli,Jessica Schleider,Denae Ford,Jina Suh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of conversational AI agents during mental health crises, highlighting their role as supplementary support when human interaction is unavailable but emphasizing the importance of fostering human-human connection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing use of conversational AI agents by individuals during mental health crises due to insufficient access to therapists and the desire to avoid burdening others.

Method: The study involved a testimonial survey of 53 first-person experiences and interviews with 16 mental health experts to analyze the role of AI agents in mental health crises.

Result: The findings indicate that people use AI agents as interim support but underscore the critical need for human-human connections during mental health crises. It also emphasizes that AI should aim to support positive actions and reduce impulsive negative actions.

Conclusion: Designing conversational AI agents as tools to guide users toward human connection, rather than replacing human interaction entirely, is a more responsible approach for mental health interventions.

Abstract: Online, people often recount their experiences turning to conversational AI agents (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) for mental health support -- going so far as to replace their therapists. These anecdotes suggest that AI agents have great potential to offer accessible mental health support. However, it's unclear how to meet this potential in extreme mental health crisis use cases. In this work, we explore the first-person experience of turning to a conversational AI agent in a mental health crisis. From a testimonial survey (n = 53) of lived experiences, we find that people use AI agents to fill the in-between spaces of human support; they turn to AI due to lack of access to mental health professionals or fears of burdening others. At the same time, our interviews with mental health experts (n = 16) suggest that human-human connection is an essential positive action when managing a mental health crisis. Using the stages of change model, our results suggest that a responsible AI crisis intervention is one that increases the user's preparedness to take a positive action while de-escalating any intended negative action. We discuss the implications of designing conversational AI agents as bridges towards human-human connection rather than ends in themselves.

### [410] [Vibe Coding, Interface Flattening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24939)
*Hongrui Jin*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) transform programming through 'vibe coding', where conversational interfaces replace traditional programming paradigms, raising concerns about dependency, control centralization, and power redistribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to critically analyze how LLMs create a shift in programming methods, and investigate the broader implications for democratization, power dynamics, and the political economy of AI-driven human-computer interactions.

Method: The author employs materialist media theory and interface theory, reconstructing the vibe-coding stack to analyze transformations in programming interfaces and control structures caused by LLMs.

Result: The study highlights how LLM-enabled tools relocate power to model and infrastructure providers, introduce new dependencies, and alter control dynamics in programming, while obscuring accountability and privatizing programming competencies.

Conclusion: Despite making programming more accessible via interface flattening, LLM-mediated development creates new dependencies, centralizes power, and reshapes the political and social structures of programming, warranting further critical examination.

Abstract: Large language models are reshaping programming by enabling 'vibe coding': the development of softwares through natural-language interaction with model-driven toolchains. This article argues that vibe coding is best understood as interface flattening, a reconfiguration in which previously distinct modalities (GUI, CLI, and API) appear to converge into a single conversational surface, even as the underlying chain of translation from intention to machinic effect lengthens and thickens. Drawing on Friedrich Kittler's materialist media theory and Alexander Galloway's account of interfaces as sites of protocol control, the paper situates programming as a historically localised interface arrangement rather than an essential relation to computation. Through a materialist reconstruction of the contemporary vibe-coding stack, it shows how remote compute infrastructures, latency and connectivity, structured outputs, function/tool calling, and interoperability standards such as the Model Context Protocol relocate control and meaning-making power to model and protocol providers. The apparent democratisation of technical capability therefore depends on new dependencies and new literacies. By foregrounding the tension between experiential flattening and infrastructural thickening, I demonstrate how LLM-mediated development redistributes symbolic labour/power, obscures responsibility, and privatises competencies previously dispersed across programming communities, contributing a critical lens on the political economy of AI-mediated human-computer interaction.

### [412] [Quasicrystalline Gibbs states in 4-dimensional lattice-gas models with finite-range interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24436)
*Siamak Taati,Jacek Miȩkisz*

Main category: math-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 4D lattice-gas model with finite-range interactions leading to quasicrystalline (non-periodic) Gibbs states at low temperatures, utilizing cellular automata and aperiodic Ammann tilings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to construct a mathematical model that exhibits stable, non-periodic quasicrystalline states, addressing challenges in describing such configurations via statistical mechanics frameworks.

Method: The authors build a 4D lattice-gas model employing the Ammann tiling and a cellular automaton framework. They utilize noise-resilient computing principles and error-correction mechanisms along additional dimensions to stabilize non-periodic space-time trajectories under noise.

Result: The results demonstrate that their constructed model produces quasicrystalline Gibbs states as low-temperature perturbations of ground states, stabilized through deterministic and noise-resistant cellular automata.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for constructing non-periodic Gibbs states, leveraging cellular automaton properties and aperiodic tiling to model stable quasicrystalline structures subject to noise.

Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional lattice-gas model with finite-range interactions that has non-periodic, ``quasicrystalline'' Gibbs states at low temperatures. Such Gibbs states are probability measures which are small perturbations of non-periodic ground-state configurations corresponding to tilings of the plane with Ammann's aperiodic tiles. Our construction is based on the correspondence between probabilistic cellular automata and Gibbs measures on their space-time trajectories, and a classical result on noise-resilient computing with cellular automata. The cellular automaton is constructed on the basis of Ammann's tiles, which are deterministic in one direction, and has non-periodic space-time trajectories corresponding to each valid tiling. Repetitions along two extra dimensions, together with an error-correction mechanism, ensure stability of the trajectories subjected to noise.

### [413] [Kidney Exchange: Faster Parameterized Algorithms and Tighter Lower Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24037)
*Aritra Banik,Sujoy Bhore,Palash Dey,Abhishek Sahu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper presents advancements in algorithms for the kidney exchange problem, improving the deterministic FPT algorithm runtime and exploring its computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient kidney exchanges among patient-donor pairs through computational models, especially given the practical constraints of small cycles and the inclusion of altruistic donors.

Method: The paper provides an improved deterministic FPT algorithm with a time complexity of O*(10.88^t) and investigates the complexity of the kidney exchange problem under different graph parameterizations, proving W[1]-hardness for pathwidth.

Result: Achieved a faster deterministic FPT algorithm (O*(10.88^t)) and identified W[1]-hardness when parameterized by pathwidth or treewidth.

Conclusion: The findings offer significant computational advancements for kidney exchanges, while also establishing limitations of the problem's complexity under certain parameterizations.

Abstract: The kidney exchange mechanism allows many patient-donor pairs who are otherwise incompatible with each other to come together and exchange kidneys along a cycle. However, due to infrastructure and legal constraints, kidney exchange can only be performed in small cycles in practice. In reality, there are also some altruistic donors who do not have any paired patients. This allows us to also perform kidney exchange along paths that start from some altruistic donor. Unfortunately, the computational task is NP-complete. To overcome this computational barrier, an important line of research focuses on designing faster algorithms, both exact and using the framework of parameterized complexity.
  The standard parameter for the kidney exchange problem is the number $t$ of patients that receive a healthy kidney. The current fastest known deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem, parameterized by $t$, is $O^\star\left(14^t\right)$. In this work, we improve this by presenting a deterministic FPT algorithm that runs in time $O^\star\left((4e)^t\right)\approx O^\star\left(10.88^t\right)$. This problem is also known to be W[1]-hard parameterized by the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph. A natural question here is whether the kidney exchange problem admits an FPT algorithm parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We answer this negatively in this paper by proving that this problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We also present some parameterized intractability results improving the current understanding of the problem under the framework of parameterized complexity.

*Colin Scheibner,Lindsay M. Smith,William Bialek*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) uncover long-range dependencies in English texts, revealing gradual learning of extended context structures, and has implications for modeling language statistically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the possibility of capturing long-range dependencies and structure in text through the application of large language models, and to explore their implications for understanding language and model training dynamics.

Method: The research uses LLMs to analyze the conditional entropy of English text, measuring how code length changes with increasing context size. They also observe training dynamics and independently validate correlations in data.

Result: It was found that dependencies exist across long ranges (up to 10,000 characters), with small but significant correlations in this range. Code lengths indicate emergent certainty for specific characters, and long-range structure is learned gradually during training.

Conclusion: The study showcases how LLMs recognize and learn long-range patterns in text, providing insights that are integral to advancing both NLP techniques and theoretical statistical physics models of language.

Abstract: We use large language models (LLMs) to uncover long-ranged structure in English texts from a variety of sources. The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates generative-model-based methods for estimating free energy differences in molecular simulations, benchmarking techniques like normalizing flows and FEAT on condensed-matter systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inefficiencies in traditional methods for estimating free energy differences, which are computationally expensive due to reliance on numerous intermediate states.

Method: The paper systematically reviews and benchmarks generative-model-based methods, focusing on discrete/continuous normalizing flows and FEAT, using simulations of monatomic ice and Lennard-Jones solids.

Result: Results reveal the performance trade-offs between different strategies, assessing their accuracy, computational cost, and scalability in condensed-phase systems.

Conclusion: The findings offer a quantitative framework to guide researchers in selecting efficient free energy estimation methods for molecular simulations.

Abstract: The accurate estimation of free energy differences between two states is a long-standing challenge in molecular simulations. Traditional approaches generally rely on sampling multiple intermediate states to ensure sufficient overlap in phase space and are, consequently, computationally expensive. Several generative-model-based methods have recently addressed this challenge by learning a direct bridge between distributions, bypassing the need for intermediate states. However, it remains unclear which approaches provide the best trade-off between efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. In this work, we systematically review these methods and benchmark selected approaches with a focus on condensed-matter systems. In particular, we investigate the performance of discrete and continuous normalizing flows in the context of targeted free energy perturbation as well as FEAT (Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport) together with the escorted Jarzynski equality, using coarse-grained monatomic ice and Lennard-Jones solids as benchmark systems. We evaluate accuracy, data efficiency, computational cost, and scalability with system size. Our results provide a quantitative framework for selecting effective free energy estimation strategies in condensed-phase systems.

*Lei Liu,Yuhao Chi,Shunqi Huang,Zhaoyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a random multiplexing technique for wireless communication to achieve more robust and adaptable systems in high-mobility, dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multiplexing methods like OTFS and AFDM struggle in dynamic real-world environments, and there is a need for a technique that works across arbitrary, complex channel conditions while maintaining low-complexity signal detection.

Method: The method involves constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel using random multiplexing. A CD-MAMP detector is employed to exploit the sparsity and randomness of the channel, with optimal power allocations developed for efficiency.

Result: Random multiplexing achieves statistical ergodicity and asymptotic optimal bit-error rates under specific assumptions. The new CD-MAMP detector is shown to be effective across various signaling configurations.

Conclusion: Random multiplexing is a robust and versatile solution for high-mobility wireless applications, demonstrating efficient communication in challenging environments with low-complexity detection.

Abstract: As wireless communication applications evolve from traditional multipath environments to high-mobility scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles, multiplexing techniques have advanced accordingly. Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored.

TL;DR: The article provides a mathematical foundation for deep gradient flow methods (DGFMs) in solving high-dimensional PDEs by analyzing generalization errors, demonstrating their reduction as training time and network size increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous theoretical framework for applying deep gradient flow methods in solving high-dimensional partial differential equations.

Method: The paper decomposes generalization error into approximation and training errors, showing how PDE solutions can be approximated as the number of neural network neurons grows, and analyzing the gradient flow behavior.

Result: It demonstrates that approximation and training errors tend to zero as network size and training time approach infinity.

Conclusion: DGFMs are mathematically validated as effective tools for solving PDEs, with provable error convergence under specific conditions.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide a firm mathematical foundation for the application of deep gradient flow methods (DGFMs) for the solution of (high-dimensional) partial differential equations (PDEs). We decompose the generalization error of DGFMs into an approximation and a training error. We first show that the solution of PDEs that satisfy reasonable and verifiable assumptions can be approximated by neural networks, thus the approximation error tends to zero as the number of neurons tends to infinity. Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity. These results combined show that the generalization error of DGFMs tends to zero as the number of neurons and the training time tend to infinity.

*Oluwatosin Akande,Gabriel P. Langlois,Akwum Onwunta*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method using connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs to directly learn priors for inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems are often ill-posed and require regularization or priors to make them solvable, especially in high-dimensional settings. Existing methods have limitations in learning priors effectively and efficiently.

Method: The authors propose a novel approach by utilizing connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs to develop deep learning architectures that learn priors directly.

Result: The numerical experiments demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach in handling high-dimensional inverse problems.

Conclusion: Learning priors directly using the proposed method represents an advancement in addressing high-dimensional inverse problems, making regularization techniques more effective and streamlined.

Abstract: Inverse problems are important mathematical problems that seek to recover model parameters from noisy data. Since inverse problems are often ill-posed, they require regularization or incorporation of prior information about the underlying model or unknown variables. Proximal operators, ubiquitous in nonsmooth optimization, are central to this because they provide a flexible and convenient way to encode priors and build efficient iterative algorithms. They have also recently become key to modern machine learning methods, e.g., for plug-and-play methods for learned denoisers and deep neural architectures for learning priors of proximal operators. The latter was developed partly due to recent work characterizing proximal operators of nonconvex priors as subdifferential of convex potentials. In this work, we propose to leverage connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs) to develop novel deep learning architectures for learning the prior. In contrast to other existing methods, we learn the prior directly without recourse to inverting the prior after training. We present several numerical results that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in high dimensions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UWB channel estimation methods, while accurate, have high computational demands that are unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: The paper develops an unsupervised Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model for UWB channel estimation and evaluates its performance against several comparative strategies on a public benchmark.

Result: The SNN approach achieves 80% test accuracy, comparable with supervised deep learning methods, while significantly reducing model complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed SNN method demonstrates its potential for neuromorphic deployment, offering a resource-efficient alternative for UWB channel estimation.

Abstract: Although existing deep learning-based Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) channel estimation methods achieve high accuracy, their computational intensity clashes sharply with the resource constraints of low-cost edge devices. Motivated by this, this letter explores the potential of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for this task and develops a fully unsupervised SNN solution. To enable a comprehensive performance analysis, we devise an extensive set of comparative strategies and evaluate them on a compelling public benchmark. Experimental results show that our unsupervised approach still attains 80% test accuracy, on par with several supervised deep learning-based strategies. Moreover, compared with complex deep learning methods, our SNN implementation is inherently suited to neuromorphic deployment and offers a drastic reduction in model complexity, bringing significant advantages for future neuromorphic practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure the validity and reliability of economic forecasts generated by LLMs by identifying potential biases from training data leaks.

Method: The method involves using state-of-the-art detection techniques to estimate the likelihood of prompts in LLM training corpus, termed Lookahead Propensity (LAP), and analyzing its correlation with forecast accuracy.

Result: The proposed test successfully identifies lookahead bias in two forecasting tasks: predicting stock returns using news headlines and predicting capital expenditures using earnings call transcripts.

Conclusion: This research offers a cost-effective and diagnostic tool for evaluating LLM-generated forecasts' credibility by measuring training data-related biases.

Abstract: We develop a statistical test to detect lookahead bias in economic forecasts generated by large language models (LLMs). Using state-of-the-art pre-training data detection techniques, we estimate the likelihood that a given prompt appeared in an LLM's training corpus, a statistic we term Lookahead Propensity (LAP). We formally show that a positive correlation between LAP and forecast accuracy indicates the presence and magnitude of lookahead bias, and apply the test to two forecasting tasks: news headlines predicting stock returns and earnings call transcripts predicting capital expenditures. Our test provides a cost-efficient, diagnostic tool for assessing the validity and reliability of LLM-generated forecasts.

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vulcan, a system that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate instance-optimal heuristics for resource management tasks, outpacing state-of-the-art human-designed algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource management in modern systems relies heavily on handcrafted heuristics, which are costly and time-intensive to adapt to evolving hardware, workloads, and environments.

Method: The authors propose Vulcan, which separates policy and mechanism using LLM-friendly interfaces for task specification and employs evolutionary search to generate optimized heuristics via LLMs.

Result: Vulcan creates heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering that outperform human-designed methods by up to 69% and 7.9% respectively.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that LLMs can synthesize efficient, task-specific heuristics, advancing automation in resource management systems with competitive performance gains.

Abstract: Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.
  We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed -- using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.
  We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance the quality, speed, and patient comfort of quantitative MRI mapping by addressing noise, motion robustness, and reliance on large training datasets.

Method: MuPa-ZTE is combined with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) and physics-based data consistency to produce improved 3D qMRI maps. Models are trained using synthetic data from digital brain phantoms.

Result: q3-MuPa achieved high accuracy, noise reduction, and structural detail preservation in qMRI mapping, generalizing well to real scans while being trained solely on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The q3-MuPa framework shows strong clinical potential for fast, silent, and accurate qMRI mapping with potential applications in various healthcare settings.

Abstract: The 3D fast silent multi-parametric mapping sequence with zero echo time (MuPa-ZTE) is a novel quantitative MRI (qMRI) acquisition that enables nearly silent scanning by using a 3D phyllotaxis sampling scheme. MuPa-ZTE improves patient comfort and motion robustness, and generates quantitative maps of T1, T2, and proton density using the acquired weighted image series. In this work, we propose a diffusion model-based qMRI mapping method that leverages both a deep generative model and physics-based data consistency to further improve the mapping performance. Furthermore, our method enables additional acquisition acceleration, allowing high-quality qMRI mapping from a fourfold-accelerated MuPa-ZTE scan (approximately 1 minute). Specifically, we trained a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to map MuPa-ZTE image series to qMRI maps, and we incorporated the MuPa-ZTE forward signal model as an explicit data consistency (DC) constraint during inference. We compared our mapping method against a baseline dictionary matching approach and a purely data-driven diffusion model. The diffusion models were trained entirely on synthetic data generated from digital brain phantoms, eliminating the need for large real-scan datasets. We evaluated on synthetic data, a NISM/ISMRM phantom, healthy volunteers, and a patient with brain metastases. The results demonstrated that our method produces 3D qMRI maps with high accuracy, reduced noise and better preservation of structural details. Notably, it generalised well to real scans despite training on synthetic data alone. The combination of the MuPa-ZTE acquisition and our physics-informed diffusion model is termed q3-MuPa, a quick, quiet, and quantitative multi-parametric mapping framework, and our findings highlight its strong clinical potential.

TL;DR: This paper introduces algorithms for multilevel resource allocation across tree-structured hierarchical systems, ensuring fairness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address fairness and efficiency in allocating resources across a hierarchy of agents with tree-structured relationships, where existing local mechanisms must work collectively across levels in the hierarchy.

Method: Two algorithms are proposed: a generic polynomial-time sequential top-down algorithm with theoretical fairness and efficiency guarantees, and an extension of the General Yankee Swap algorithm for multilevel settings with practical fairness.

Result: The first algorithm provides strong theoretical guarantees of fairness and efficiency, while the extended General Yankee Swap focuses on efficiency but demonstrates excellent fairness in practice.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms advance multilevel resource allocation by offering practical and theoretically sound solutions for hierarchical systems, applicable with various local mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of multilevel fair allocation of resources with tree-structured hierarchical relations among agents. While at each level it is possible to consider the problem locally as an allocation of an agent to its children, the multilevel allocation can be seen as a trace capturing the fact that the process is iterated until the leaves of the tree. In principle, each intermediary node may have its own local allocation mechanism. The main challenge is then to design algorithms which can retain good fairness and efficiency properties. In this paper we propose two original algorithms under the assumption that leaves of the tree have matroid-rank utility functions and the utility of any internal node is the sum of the utilities of its children. The first one is a generic polynomial-time sequential algorithm that comes with theoretical guarantees in terms of efficiency and fairness. It operates in a top-down fashion -- as commonly observed in real-world applications -- and is compatible with various local algorithms. The second one extends the recently proposed General Yankee Swap to the multilevel setting. This extension comes with efficiency guarantees only, but we show that it preserves excellent fairness properties in practice.

### [424] [Non-stationary dynamics of interspike intervals in neuronal populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23922)
*Luca Falorsi,Gianni V. Vinci,Maurizio Mattia*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework to study the dynamics of integrate-and-fire neurons, focusing on the joint evolution of membrane potential and time since last spike using a 2D Fokker-Planck equation and deriving insights into inter-spike interval (ISI) distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the temporal dynamics of neuron populations, particularly the inter-spike interval (ISI) distributions, under both stationary and non-stationary conditions such as varying inputs or oscillatory behaviors.

Method: The authors utilized a population density framework, leading to a two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation and a hierarchy of equations for ISI moments. They also applied a perturbative expansion around the stationary state to derive analytic expressions for ISI response to input modulations.

Result: The study characterizes how the ISI distribution evolves over time in both stationary and non-stationary neuronal populations, providing a linear response approximation for weak input perturbations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust method to analyze time-dependent and stationary neuronal ISI distributions, with applications in understanding input-driven neuronal population behaviors.

Abstract: We study the joint dynamics of membrane potential and time since the last spike in a population of integrate-and-fire neurons using a population density framework. This leads to a two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation that captures the evolution of the full neuronal state, along with a one-dimensional hierarchy of equations for the moments of the inter-spike interval (ISI). The formalism allows us to characterize the time-dependent ISI distribution, even when the population is far from stationarity, such as under time-varying external input or during network oscillations. By performing a perturbative expansion around the stationary state, we also derive an analytic expression for the linear response of the ISI distribution to weak input modulations.

### [425] [A multimodal Transformer for InSAR-based ground deformation forecasting with cross-site generalization across Europe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23906)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal patch-based Transformer for predicting ground deformation using EGMS time series data, outperforming other models in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to address the challenge of near-real-time prediction of ground deformation to support urban planning, infrastructure management, and natural hazard mitigation, overcoming the difficulty of dealing with superimposed trends, cycles, and spatial heterogeneity in the data.

Method: The researchers proposed a multimodal patch-based Transformer model that uses recent displacement snapshots, static kinematic indicators, and harmonic day-of-year encodings to predict displacement maps on a fixed-interval, single-step basis.

Result: The proposed Transformer model outperformed other approaches like CNN-LSTM and multimodal STGCN, achieving high accuracy with RMSE of 0.90 mm and R² of 0.97 on test data.

Conclusion: This multimodal Transformer model provides an effective and accurate approach for near-real-time ground deformation prediction, enhancing support for urban planning and hazard mitigation efforts.

Abstract: Near-real-time regional-scale monitoring of ground deformation is increasingly required to support urban planning, critical infrastructure management, and natural hazard mitigation. While Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and continental-scale services such as the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) provide dense observations of past motion, predicting the next observation remains challenging due to the superposition of long-term trends, seasonal cycles, and occasional abrupt discontinuities (e.g., co-seismic steps), together with strong spatial heterogeneity. In this study we propose a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series (resampled to a 64x64 grid over 100 km x 100 km tiles). The model ingests recent displacement snapshots together with (i) static kinematic indicators (mean velocity, acceleration, seasonal amplitude) computed in a leakage-safe manner from the training window only, and (ii) harmonic day-of-year encodings. On the eastern Ireland tile (E32N34), the STGCN is strongest in the displacement-only setting, whereas the multimodal Transformer clearly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM+Attn, and multimodal STGCN when all models receive the same multimodal inputs, achieving RMSE = 0.90 mm and $R^2$ = 0.97 on the test set with the best threshold accuracies.

*Anbang Zhang,Chenyuan Feng,Wai Ho Mow,Jia Ye,Shuaishuai Guo,Geyong Min,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces OptiVote, a framework for enabling efficient federated learning in space data centers using non-coherent optical communication to address challenges of bandwidth, energy, and dynamic inter-satellite link conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the need to support distributed computing and learning for the growing mega-constellations of satellites, overcoming challenges like constrained bandwidth, energy, and highly dynamic satellite link conditions in federated learning systems.

Method: OptiVote integrates signSGD with majority-vote aggregation and pulse-position modulation within a free-space optical AirComp framework. It eliminates the need for precise phase synchronization and introduces a CSI-free dynamic power control to balance received energies under heterogeneous conditions.

Result: The theoretical analysis confirms the robustness of OptiVote under statistical FSO channels, establishes convergence guarantees, and mitigates aggregation bias in federated learning for space data centers.

Conclusion: The proposed OptiVote framework shows potential as a robust and efficient solution for enabling federated learning in space environments with dynamic inter-satellite channel impairments, addressing key challenges in space data centers.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of mega-constellations is driving the long-term vision of space data centers (SDCs), where interconnected satellites form in-orbit distributed computing and learning infrastructures. Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.

*Chandler Haight,Svetlana Roudenko,Zhongming Wang*

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: The paper compares classical numerical solvers with neural network-based methods for solving one-dimensional dispersive PDEs, emphasizing their accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the performance of classical numerical solvers and modern neural network-based methods in solving ground states or solitary-wave profiles in one-dimensional dispersive PDEs.

Method: The study integrates comparison across classical techniques like Petviashvili's method and Newton iterations, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and operator-learning approaches, along with analysis of their computational accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Classical methods outperform neural network-based approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy for single-instance computations. While operator-learning methods offer rapid inference for repeated problems post-training, they are computationally intensive during training and less accurate for single-instance situations.

Conclusion: Classical solvers are generally more accurate and efficient in one-dimensional problems, while neural networks offer qualitative solutions but are less effective in this context. Operator-learning methods hold promise for repeated or real-time applications due to rapid inference after pretraining.

Abstract: We present a comparative study of classical numerical solvers, such as Petviashvili's method or finite difference with Newton iterations, and neural network-based methods for computing ground states or profiles of solitary-wave solutions to the one-dimensional dispersive PDEs that include the nonlinear Schrödinger, the nonlinear Klein-Gordon and the generalized KdV equations. We confirm that classical approaches retain high-order accuracy and strong computational efficiency for single-instance problems in the one-dimensional setting. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are also able to reproduce qualitative solutions but are generally less accurate and less efficient in low dimensions than classical solvers due to expensive training and slow convergence. We also investigate the operator-learning methods, which, although computationally intensive during training, can be reused across many parameter instances, providing rapid inference after pretraining, making them attractive for applications involving repeated simulations or real-time predictions. For single-instance computations, however, the accuracy of operator-learning methods remains lower than that of classical methods or PINNs, in general.

### [428] [Robust Bayesian Dynamic Programming for On-policy Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24580)
*Shanyu Han,Yangbo He,Yang Liu*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL), combining robustness against transition uncertainty with robust risk measures. It proposes a Bayesian DP algorithm for solving the corresponding robust Markov decision process, validated both analytically and empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of incorporating both risk sensitivity and robustness towards transition uncertainties in reinforcement learning frameworks, which is essential for applications that operate in uncertain environments.

Method: The paper defines two coupled risk measures (inner and outer), constructs a risk-sensitive robust Markov decision process (RSRMDP), derives its Bellman equation, and develops a Bayesian Dynamic Programming (Bayesian DP) algorithm involving Monte Carlo sampling and convex optimization for risk-based updates.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves excellent convergence properties, demonstrates strong consistency guarantees, converges to a near-optimal policy in training, and effectively handles risk sensitivity and robustness. Empirical experiments validate its advantages, particularly in its application to option hedging.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes current RL methods, offers a robust and risk-sensitive approach, and proves effective in practical applications, showcasing the significant potential for handling uncertainties and extending RL in risk-averse domains.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) that incorporates robustness against transition uncertainty. We define two distinct yet coupled risk measures: an inner risk measure addressing state and cost randomness and an outer risk measure capturing transition dynamics uncertainty. Our framework unifies and generalizes most existing RL frameworks by permitting general coherent risk measures for both inner and outer risk measures. Within this framework, we construct a risk-sensitive robust Markov decision process (RSRMDP), derive its Bellman equation, and provide error analysis under a given posterior distribution. We further develop a Bayesian Dynamic Programming (Bayesian DP) algorithm that alternates between posterior updates and value iteration. The approach employs an estimator for the risk-based Bellman operator that combines Monte Carlo sampling with convex optimization, for which we prove strong consistency guarantees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges to a near-optimal policy in the training environment and analyze both the sample complexity and the computational complexity under the Dirichlet posterior and CVaR. Finally, we validate our approach through two numerical experiments. The results exhibit excellent convergence properties while providing intuitive demonstrations of its advantages in both risk-sensitivity and robustness. Empirically, we further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm through an application on option hedging.

### [429] [Fairness-Aware Insurance Pricing: A Multi-Objective Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24747)
*Tim J. Boonen,Xinyue Fan,Zixiao Quan*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: The paper discusses a new multi-objective optimization framework for fair insurance pricing, balancing accuracy and fairness criteria using NSGA-II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address trade-offs in fairness and accuracy in insurance pricing models, which become more complex with machine learning methods.

Method: The authors propose a multi-objective optimization framework using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to optimize accuracy, group fairness, individual fairness, and counterfactual fairness.

Result: Results suggest XGBoost improves accuracy but worsens fairness disparities, while specific models excel in various fairness aspects. The proposed approach achieves a balanced compromise across all criteria.

Conclusion: The proposed framework outperforms single-objective models, achieving better trade-offs between profitability and fairness in insurance pricing.

Abstract: Machine learning improves predictive accuracy in insurance pricing but exacerbates trade-offs between competing fairness criteria across different discrimination measures, challenging regulators and insurers to reconcile profitability with equitable outcomes. While existing fairness-aware models offer partial solutions under GLM and XGBoost estimation methods, they remain constrained by single-objective optimization, failing to holistically navigate a conflicting landscape of accuracy, group fairness, individual fairness, and counterfactual fairness. To address this, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework that jointly optimizes all four criteria via the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), generating a diverse Pareto front of trade-off solutions. We use a specific selection mechanism to extract a premium on this front. Our results show that XGBoost outperforms GLM in accuracy but amplifies fairness disparities; the Orthogonal model excels in group fairness, while Synthetic Control leads in individual and counterfactual fairness. Our method consistently achieves a balanced compromise, outperforming single-model approaches.

*Samaresh Kumar Singh,Joyjit Roy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Economic Denial Security (EDS), which makes cyberattacks economically infeasible in IoT/edge environments through cost amplification mechanisms, achieving robust results independent of traditional detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the ineffectiveness of detection-based security against advanced, stealthy attacks in resource-constrained IoT/edge environments.

Method: The authors propose the EDS framework, which employs adaptive computational puzzles, decoy-driven interaction entropy, temporal stretching, and bandwidth taxation, formalized as a Stackelberg game for optimal parameter selection.

Result: EDS demonstrated significant attack mitigation with 32-560x slowdown, 85-520:1 cost asymmetry, 27% improvement over traditional IDS, and resource efficiency suitable for microcontrollers.

Conclusion: EDS successfully protects IoT/edge systems by economically disadvantaging attackers, offering an effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional detection methods.

Abstract: Detection-based security fails against sophisticated attackers using encryption, stealth, and low-rate techniques, particularly in IoT/edge environments where resource constraints preclude ML-based intrusion detection. We present Economic Denial Security (EDS), a detection-independent framework that makes attacks economically infeasible by exploiting a fundamental asymmetry: defenders control their environment while attackers cannot. EDS composes four mechanisms adaptive computational puzzles, decoy-driven interaction entropy, temporal stretching, and bandwidth taxation achieving provably superlinear cost amplification. We formalize EDS as a Stackelberg game, deriving closed-form equilibria for optimal parameter selection (Theorem 1) and proving that mechanism composition yields 2.1x greater costs than the sum of individual mechanisms (Theorem 2). EDS requires < 12KB memory, enabling deployment on ESP32 class microcontrollers. Evaluation on a 20-device heterogeneous IoT testbed across four attack scenarios (n = 30 trials, p < 0.001) demonstrates: 32-560x attack slowdown, 85-520:1 cost asymmetry, 8-62% attack success reduction, < 20ms latency overhead, and close to 0% false positives. Validation against IoT-23 malware (Mirai, Torii, Hajime) shows 88% standalone mitigation; combined with ML-IDS, EDS achieves 94% mitigation versus 67% for IDS alone a 27% improvement. EDS provides detection-independent protection suitable for resource-constrained environments where traditional approaches fail. The ability to detect and mitigate the malware samples tested was enhanced; however, the benefits provided by EDS were realized even without the inclusion of an IDS. Overall, the implementation of EDS serves to shift the economic balance in favor of the defender and provides a viable method to protect IoT and edge systems methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dependency on manual document handling in real estate leads to inefficiency and higher risk of fraud, necessitating an automated and secure solution.

Method: The approach involves using OCR and NLP for extracting data from documents, standardizing them into verifiable credentials, detecting inconsistencies via automated matching, and leveraging blockchain for a decentralized trust layer.

Result: The system prototype, which integrates an OCR-NLP pipeline, credential management backend, and user-friendly frontend, demonstrates reliable performance with competitive accuracy and time-efficient verification.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves transparency, trust, and efficiency in real estate transactions while showcasing scalability and security for future adoption.

Abstract: The real estate sector remains highly dependent on manual document handling and verification, making processes inefficient and prone to fraud. This work presents a system that integrates optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), and verifiable credentials (VCs) to automate document extraction, verification, and management. The approach standardizes heterogeneous document formats into VCs and applies automated data matching to detect inconsistencies, while the blockchain provides a decentralized trust layer that reinforces transparency and integrity. A prototype was developed that comprises (i) an OCR-NLP extraction pipeline trained on synthetic datasets, (ii) a backend for credential issuance and management, and (iii) a frontend supporting issuer, holder, and verifier interactions. Experimental results show that the models achieve competitive accuracy across multiple document types and that the end-to-end pipeline reduces verification time while preserving reliability. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential to streamline real estate transactions, strengthen stakeholder trust, and enable scalable, secure digital processes.

*Biagio Montaruli,Serena Elisa Ponta,Luca Compagna,Davide Balzarotti*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates the limitations of SourceRank, a system for measuring the quality of open-source packages, highlighting its vulnerability to evasion attacks and inability to reliably distinguish between benign and malicious packages in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address weaknesses in SourceRank, as it may be exploited by attackers through evasion techniques to make malicious packages appear trustworthy.

Method: Proposes a threat model for SourceRank that identifies potential evasion approaches, including URL confusion. Analyzes SourceRank distributions in the PyPI ecosystem using the MalwareBench dataset and a real-world dataset of 122,398 packages.

Result: Finds that SourceRank struggles to separate benign from malicious packages in real-world conditions because it does not reflect package removals promptly. Also uncovers an increase in the prevalence of the URL confusion attack technique over time.

Conclusion: SourceRank is not a reliable tool for distinguishing between malicious and benign packages in practical settings, with the URL confusion technique being a significant and growing threat.

Abstract: SourceRank is a scoring system made of 18 metrics that assess the popularity and quality of open-source packages. Despite being used in several recent studies, none has thoroughly analyzed its reliability against evasion attacks aimed at inflating the score of malicious packages, thereby masquerading them as trustworthy. To fill this gap, we first propose a threat model that identifies potential evasion approaches for each metric, including the URL confusion technique, which can affect 5 out of the 18 metrics by leveraging a URL pointing to a legitimate repository potentially unrelated to the malicious package.
  Furthermore, we study the reliability of SourceRank in the PyPI ecosystem by analyzing the SourceRank distributions of benign and malicious packages in the state-of-the-art MalwareBench dataset, as well as in a real-world dataset of 122,398 packages. Our analysis reveals that, while historical data suggests a clear distinction between benign and malicious packages, the real-world distributions overlap significantly, mainly due to SourceRank's failure to timely reflect package removals. As a result, SourceRank cannot be reliably used to discriminate between benign and malicious packages in real-world scenarios, nor to select benign packages among those available on PyPI.
  Finally, our analysis reveals that URL confusion represents an emerging attack vector, with its prevalence increasing from 4.2% in MalwareBench to 7.0% in our real-world dataset. Moreover, this technique is often used alongside other evasion techniques and can significantly inflate the SourceRank metrics of malicious packages.

TL;DR: The paper studies decentralized Web3's Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance using blockchain RegTech, presenting taxonomies and analyzing gaps between academic and industry practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address AML challenges in decentralized Web3 environments using innovative blockchain-specific RegTech solutions.

Method: The authors developed taxonomies and framework approaches, analyzed operational platforms and academic prototypes, and conducted systematic literature reviews.

Result: The study highlights Web3 RegTech's transaction graph analysis, risk assessment capabilities, and identifies gaps like cross-chain analysis and scalability issues.

Conclusion: Web3 RegTech solutions can enable significant compliance innovations but require targeted research to overcome remaining challenges while maintaining decentralization principles.

Abstract: The decentralized architecture of Web3 technologies creates fundamental challenges for Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism compliance. Traditional regulatory technology solutions designed for centralized financial systems prove inadequate for blockchain's transparent yet pseudonymous networks. This systematization examines how blockchain-native RegTech solutions leverage distributed ledger properties to enable novel compliance capabilities.
  We develop three taxonomies organizing the Web3 RegTech domain: a regulatory paradigm evolution framework across ten dimensions, a compliance protocol taxonomy encompassing five verification layers, and a RegTech lifecycle framework spanning preventive, real-time, and investigative phases. Through analysis of 41 operational commercial platforms and 28 academic prototypes selected from systematic literature review (2015-2025), we demonstrate that Web3 RegTech enables transaction graph analysis, real-time risk assessment, cross-chain analytics, and privacy-preserving verification approaches that are difficult to achieve or less commonly deployed in traditional centralized systems.
  Our analysis reveals critical gaps between academic innovation and industry deployment, alongside persistent challenges in cross-chain tracking, DeFi interaction analysis, privacy protocol monitoring, and scalability. We synthesize architectural best practices and identify research directions addressing these gaps while respecting Web3's core principles of decentralization, transparency, and user sovereignty.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the ASG-SI framework to audit and manage agentic self-improvement in reinforcement learning systems, providing verifiable rewards and reusable components for transparency and governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving AI agents face challenges in security and governance, such as reward hacking and behavioral drift, due to opaque updates and lack of auditability.

Method: ASG-SI iteratively compiles improvements into an auditable skill graph, ensuring verifiable rewards, replay-based validation, and contract checks. It incorporates experience synthesis and memory control for stable performance.

Result: The paper introduces ASG-SI with a fully runnable reference implementation. Results show verifier-backed reward validation, successful skill compilation, and measurable improvement under continual tasks.

Conclusion: ASG-SI provides a structured governance framework for self-improving agents, focusing on reproducibility and verification, while addressing security risks like reward misuse and behavioral unpredictability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is increasingly used to transform large language models into agentic systems that act over long horizons, invoke tools, and manage memory under partial observability. While recent work has demonstrated performance gains through tool learning, verifiable rewards, and continual training, deployed self-improving agents raise unresolved security and governance challenges: optimization pressure can incentivize reward hacking, behavioral drift is difficult to audit or reproduce, and improvements are often entangled in opaque parameter updates rather than reusable, verifiable artifacts.
  This paper proposes Audited Skill-Graph Self-Improvement (ASG-SI), a framework that treats self-improvement as iterative compilation of an agent into a growing, auditable skill graph. Each candidate improvement is extracted from successful trajectories, normalized into a skill with an explicit interface, and promoted only after passing verifier-backed replay and contract checks. Rewards are decomposed into reconstructible components derived from replayable evidence, enabling independent audit of promotion decisions and learning signals. ASG-SI further integrates experience synthesis for scalable stress testing and continual memory control to preserve long-horizon performance under bounded context.
  We present a complete system architecture, threat model, and security analysis, and provide a fully runnable reference implementation that demonstrates verifier-backed reward construction, skill compilation, audit logging, and measurable improvement under continual task streams. ASG-SI reframes agentic self-improvement as accumulation of verifiable, reusable capabilities, offering a practical path toward reproducible evaluation and operational governance of self-improving AI agents.

*Manu,Yi Guo,Jo Plested,Tim Lynar,Kanchana Thilakarathna,Nirhoshan Sivaroopan,Jack Yang,Wangli Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper studies prompt-based denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on large language models (LLMs) using two novel black-box approaches and introduces benchmarks and metrics for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address emerging challenges related to LLMs' vulnerability to over-generation, which can degrade output quality, increase latency and costs, and serve as a vector for DoS attacks.

Method: The study introduces two prompt-based black-box attackers: (1) Evolutionary Over-Generation Prompt Search (EOGen), using a search mechanism in token space, and (2) RL-GOAL, employing reinforcement learning for length-targeted prefix generation. A new metric, Over-Generation Factor (OGF), is proposed for evaluation along with stall and latency summaries.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate strong over-generation performance, with RL-GOAL attaining a mean OGF of up to 2.81 and outperforming EOGen in effectiveness. Success rates and detailed metrics are provided.

Conclusion: The paper highlights vulnerabilities in LLMs stemming from black-box prompt-based attacks, offering effective methodologies to characterize and benchmark these risks, and paving the way for better attack mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be driven into over-generation, emitting thousands of tokens before producing an end-of-sequence (EOS) token. This degrades answer quality, inflates latency and cost, and can be weaponized as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Recent work has begun to study DoS-style prompt attacks, but typically focuses on a single attack algorithm or assumes white-box access, without an attack-side benchmark that compares prompt-based attackers in a black-box, query-only regime with a known tokenizer. We introduce such a benchmark and study two prompt-only attackers. The first is Evolutionary Over-Generation Prompt Search (EOGen), which searches the token space for prefixes that suppress EOS and induce long continuations. The second is a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning attacker (RL-GOAL) that trains a network to generate prefixes conditioned on a target length. To characterize behavior, we introduce Over-Generation Factor (OGF), the ratio of produced tokens to a model's context window, along with stall and latency summaries. Our evolutionary attacker achieves mean OGF = 1.38 +/- 1.15 and Success@OGF >= 2 of 24.5 percent on Phi-3. RL-GOAL is stronger: across victims it achieves higher mean OGF (up to 2.81 +/- 1.38).

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Jailbreaking large language models is assessed more critically by considering both input and output safety filters in deployment pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe usage of large language models and addressing vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks in real-world deployments.

Method: Conducted a systematic evaluation of jailbreak techniques against both input and output filters within a full inference pipeline.

Result: Nearly all jailbreak techniques are detectable by safety filters, yet there's potential to improve filter balance (recall vs precision).

Conclusion: Prior assessments may exaggerate jailbreak success; optimizing detection usability and effectiveness needed for safety systems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed, ensuring their safe use is paramount. Jailbreaking, adversarial prompts that bypass model alignment to trigger harmful outputs, present significant risks, with existing studies reporting high success rates in evading common LLMs. However, previous evaluations have focused solely on the models, neglecting the full deployment pipeline, which typically incorporates additional safety mechanisms like content moderation filters. To address this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks targeting LLM safety alignment, assessing their success across the full inference pipeline, including both input and output filtering stages. Our findings yield two key insights: first, nearly all evaluated jailbreak techniques can be detected by at least one safety filter, suggesting that prior assessments may have overestimated the practical success of these attacks; second, while safety filters are effective in detection, there remains room to better balance recall and precision to further optimize protection and user experience. We highlight critical gaps and call for further refinement of detection accuracy and usability in LLM safety systems.

The paper introduces Meta Learning Malware Detection (MeLeMaD), a novel framework leveraging the adaptability and generalization capabilities of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for malware detection. MeLeMaD incorporates a novel feature selection technique, Chunk-wise Feature Selection based on Gradient Boosting (CFSGB), tailored for handling large-scale, high-dimensional malware datasets, significantly enhancing the detection efficiency. Two benchmark malware datasets (CIC-AndMal2020 and BODMAS) and a custom dataset (EMBOD) were used for rigorously validating the MeLeMaD, achieving a remarkable performance in terms of key evaluation measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, MCC, and AUC. With accuracies of 98.04\% on CIC-AndMal2020 and 99.97\% on BODMAS, MeLeMaD outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The custom dataset, EMBOD, also achieves a commendable accuracy of 97.85\%. The results underscore the MeLeMaD's potential to address the challenges of robustness, adaptability, and large-scale, high-dimensional datasets in malware detection, paving the way for more effective and efficient cybersecurity solutions.

### [440] [Training-Free Color-Aware Adversarial Diffusion Sanitization for Diffusion Stegomalware Defense at Security Gateways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24499)
*Vladimir Frants,Sos Agaian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adversarial Diffusion Sanitization (ADS), a novel approach to neutralize diffusion-based steganography payloads without detection or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of generative AI has facilitated covert communication methods like diffusion-based steganography, which are difficult to detect or counter under existing methods.

Method: ADS uses a pretrained denoiser and a quaternion-coupled update rule to sanitize steganographic payloads embedded in diffusion-generated images, minimizing artifacts while maintaining image quality.

Result: Testing against Pulsar, the state-of-the-art diffusion steganography method, showed that ADS nearly eliminates decoder success rates while maintaining minimal perceptual distortions.

Conclusion: ADS provides an efficient defense mechanism against diffusion-based steganography, offering a strong balance between security and utility.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of generative AI has normalized large-scale synthetic media creation, enabling new forms of covert communication. Recent generative steganography methods, particularly those based on diffusion models, can embed high-capacity payloads without fine-tuning or auxiliary decoders, creating significant challenges for detection and remediation. Coverless diffusion-based techniques are difficult to counter because they generate image carriers directly from secret data, enabling attackers to deliver stegomalware for command-and-control, payload staging, and data exfiltration while bypassing detectors that rely on cover-stego discrepancies. This work introduces Adversarial Diffusion Sanitization (ADS), a training-free defense for security gateways that neutralizes hidden payloads rather than detecting them. ADS employs an off-the-shelf pretrained denoiser as a differentiable proxy for diffusion-based decoders and incorporates a color-aware, quaternion-coupled update rule to reduce artifacts under strict distortion limits. Under a practical threat model and in evaluation against the state-of-the-art diffusion steganography method Pulsar, ADS drives decoder success rates to near zero with minimal perceptual impact. Results demonstrate that ADS provides a favorable security-utility trade-off compared to standard content transformations, offering an effective mitigation strategy against diffusion-driven steganography.

*Ruixuan Huang,Qingyue Wang,Hantao Huang,Yudong Gao,Dong Chen,Shuai Wang,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses a vulnerability in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures where adversarial inputs can exploit routing strategies, causing inefficiency and denial-of-service attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how adversarial prompts can compromise load balancing in MoE architectures, leading to efficiency vulnerabilities.

Method: Proposes a black-box strategy, RepetitionCurse, utilizing repetitive token patterns to exploit the flaw in MoE router behavior, model-agnostically.

Result: RepetitionCurse increases latency significantly, up to 3.063x, under testing on prominent models like Mixtral-8x7B.

Conclusion: The vulnerability in MoE routing underscores the need for robust solutions to ensure service-level agreements in large language models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts architectures have become the standard for scaling large language models due to their superior parameter efficiency. To accommodate the growing number of experts in practice, modern inference systems commonly adopt expert parallelism to distribute experts across devices. However, the absence of explicit load balancing constraints during inference allows adversarial inputs to trigger severe routing concentration. We demonstrate that out-of-distribution prompts can manipulate the routing strategy such that all tokens are consistently routed to the same set of top-$k$ experts, which creates computational bottlenecks on certain devices while forcing others to idle. This converts an efficiency mechanism into a denial-of-service attack vector, leading to violations of service-level agreements for time to first token. We propose RepetitionCurse, a low-cost black-box strategy to exploit this vulnerability. By identifying a universal flaw in MoE router behavior, RepetitionCurse constructs adversarial prompts using simple repetitive token patterns in a model-agnostic manner. On widely deployed MoE models like Mixtral-8x7B, our method increases end-to-end inference latency by 3.063x, degrading service availability significantly.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SynRAG is a unified framework that generates automated queries for various SIEM platforms, improving threat detection and incident investigation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the diversity among SIEM platforms, which challenges analysts due to differing architectures, attributes, and query languages.

Method: SynRAG introduces a platform-agnostic, specification-based mechanism to automatically generate platform-specific threat detection queries.

Result: SynRAG outperforms state-of-the-art models like GPT, Llama, and Claude in generating effective cross-SIEM queries during evaluations.

Conclusion: SynRAG simplifies cross-platform SIEM monitoring, reduces the need for specialized training, and enhances security operations efficiency.

Abstract: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are essential for large enterprises to monitor their IT infrastructure by ingesting and analyzing millions of logs and events daily. Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models.

*Yalin E. Sagduyu,Tugba Erpek,Aylin Yener,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper investigates a deep learning-based framework for semantic communications that improves bandwidth efficiency, supports multiple tasks, and minimizes information leakage to eavesdroppers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance task-specific performance in next-generation wireless communications while preventing sensitive information leakage to unintended receivers.

Method: The framework employs min-max optimization for security, along with an auxiliary perturbation layer to reduce semantic leakage without affecting legitimate receiver performance. Performance analysis uses MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Result: The results show improved semantic accuracy, robust reconstruction for legitimate users, and significant reduction in eavesdropper inference performance, even in challenging wireless conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a promising approach for secure and efficient semantic communications with privacy guarantees in realistic wireless networks.

Abstract: Semantic communications conveys task-relevant meaning rather than focusing solely on message reconstruction, improving bandwidth efficiency and robustness for next-generation wireless systems. However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task. This comprehensive framework motivates semantic communication designs with tunable, end-to-end privacy against adaptive adversaries in realistic wireless settings.

*Yuya Miyaoka,Masaki Inoue,Kengo Urata,Shigeaki Harada*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining natural language processing (NLP) for user intent interpretation and optimization techniques for virtual network configuration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing intent-based networking lacks guaranteed feasibility in configuration generation, requiring improvements in accuracy, flexibility, and reliability.

Method: The authors introduce a two-stage framework using NLP (Sentence-BERT and LLM) for interpreting user intent and integer linear programming for optimal virtual machine placement and routing.

Result: The framework dynamically adjusts virtual network configurations; LLM-based models show better accuracy, while Sentence-BERT-SVM models are faster for real-time operation.

Conclusion: Integrating NLP intent extraction with optimization ensures safer, more user-friendly, and reliable virtual network management.

Abstract: This paper proposes a chat-driven network management framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) with optimization-based virtual network allocation, enabling intuitive and reliable reconfiguration of virtual network services. Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.

Motivation: To address the under-measurement of abstraction and library-mediated reasoning in formal theorem proving benchmarks, particularly in the context of category theory.

Method: The authors created LeanCat, a Lean benchmark with 100 tasks divided into topics and difficulty tiers, assessed using both LLM-assisted and human grading methods.

Result: The best language model solved 8.25% of tasks at pass@1 and 12.00% at pass@4. LeanBridge, utilizing LeanExplore to consult Mathlib, outperformed single-model baselines.

Conclusion: LeanCat serves as an effective tool for tracking progress in AI-driven formalization tasks, especially in research-level mathematics using Lean.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in formal theorem proving, yet current benchmarks under-measure the kind of abstraction and library-mediated reasoning that organizes modern mathematics. In parallel with FATE's emphasis on frontier algebra, we introduce LeanCat, a Lean benchmark for category-theoretic formalization -- a unifying language for mathematical structure and a core layer of modern proof engineering -- serving as a stress test of structural, interface-level reasoning. Part I: 1-Categories contains 100 fully formalized statement-level tasks, curated into topic families and three difficulty tiers via an LLM-assisted + human grading process. The best model solves 8.25% of tasks at pass@1 (32.50%/4.17%/0.00% by Easy/Medium/High) and 12.00% at pass@4 (50.00%/4.76%/0.00%). We also evaluate LeanBridge which use LeanExplore to search Mathlib, and observe consistent gains over single-model baselines. LeanCat is intended as a compact, reusable checkpoint for tracking both AI and human progress toward reliable, research-level formalization in Lean.

*Prosenjit Howlader,Churn-Jung Liau*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a weighted modal logic tailored for possibilistic reasoning within fuzzy formal contexts, offering sound axiomatization and illustrating expressive capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work aims to develop a logic system to better handle fuzzy formal contexts by leveraging possibilistic reasoning and enriching the expressive capability of formal concept analysis.

Method: A new logic system equipped with two distinct weighted modal operators for necessity and sufficiency is proposed. These are incorporated into axiomatizations that are both sound and complete, in conjunction with generalized FCA notions.

Result: The weighted modal logic is proven sound and complete for fuzzy context models. Additionally, it effectively represents and extends major FCA concepts.

Conclusion: This logic provides an enhanced framework for reasoning in fuzzy contexts and can be extended to handle multi-relational fuzzy contexts, improving its applicability and expressiveness.

Abstract: We introduce a two-sort weighted modal logic for possibilistic reasoning with fuzzy formal contexts. The syntax of the logic includes two types of weighted modal operators corresponding to classical necessity ($\Box$) and sufficiency ($\boxminus$) modalities and its formulas are interpreted in fuzzy formal contexts based on possibility theory. We present its axiomatization that is \emph{sound} with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. In addition, both the necessity and sufficiency fragments of the logic are also individually complete with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. We highlight the expressive power of the logic with some illustrative examples. As a formal context is the basic construct of formal concept analysis (FCA), we generalize three main notions in FCA, i.e., formal concepts, object oriented concepts, and property oriented concepts, to their corresponding $c$-cut concepts in fuzzy formal contexts. Then, we show that our logical language can represent all three of these generalized notions. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of extending our logic to reasoning with multi-relational fuzzy contexts, in which the Boolean combinations of different fuzzy relations are allowed.

Motivation: The motivation is to create a generative model capable of reconstructing turbulent flow dynamics from sparse, decorrelated snapshots, addressing challenges in accurately interpolating spatiotemporal flow sequences for complex dynamics.

Method: The authors use conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to interpolate spatiotemporal turbulent flow sequences. The results are validated on 2D Kolmogorov Flow and 3D Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability datasets, focusing on statistical turbulence properties.

Result: The proposed method generates flow sequences that preserve statistical turbulence metrics, including time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy spectra and evolving flow statistics during critical phases of instability.

Conclusion: The DDPM-based approach is a promising surrogate for generating accurate turbulent flow dynamics, demonstrating the ability to interpolate coherent spatiotemporal sequences that preserve key turbulence characteristics.

Abstract: We investigate the statistical accuracy of temporally interpolated spatiotemporal flow sequences between sparse, decorrelated snapshots of turbulent flow fields using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The developed method is presented as a proof-of-concept generative surrogate for reconstructing coherent turbulent dynamics between sparse snapshots, demonstrated on a 2D Kolmogorov Flow, and a 3D Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI). We analyse the generated flow sequences through the lens of statistical turbulence, examining the time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy spectra over generated sequences, and temporal decay of turbulent structures. For the non-stationary Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability, we assess the ability of the proposed method to capture evolving flow statistics across the most strongly time-varying flow regime. We additionally examine instantaneous fields and physically motivated metrics at key stages of the KHI flow evolution.

Motivation: To address the challenge of collision-free navigation in marine vessels operating under strong environmental disturbances while meeting the demands of computational efficiency for small vessels with limited processing resources.

Method: The framework integrates Sliding Mode Control for robustness, High-Order Control Barrier Functions with adaptiveness for obstacle avoidance, and a fast projection method to adjust control only as necessary. This approach is evaluated on a detailed nonlinear model of a 3-DOF marine vessel with thruster allocation.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate the method ensures robust navigation, obstacle avoidance, and maintains computational efficiency suitable for real-time execution on embedded systems.

Conclusion: The proposed SMC-HOCBF framework offers a promising solution for safety-critical control in small marine robots and vessels, achieving robust and efficient performance despite resource constraints and strong disturbances.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel safe control framework that integrates Sliding Mode Control (SMC), High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) with state-dependent adaptiveness and a lightweight projection for collision-free navigation of an over-actuated 3-DOF marine surface vessel subjected to strong environmental disturbances (wind, waves, and current). SMC provides robustness to matched disturbances common in marine operations, while HOCBFs enforce forward invariance of obstacle-avoidance constraints. A fast half-space projection method adjusts the SMC control only when needed, preserving robustness and minimizing chattering. The approach is evaluated on a nonlinear marine platform model that includes added mass, hydrodynamic damping, and full thruster allocation. Simulation results show robust navigation, guaranteed obstacle avoidance, and computational efficiency suitable for real-time embedded use. For small marine robots and surface vessels with limited onboard computational resources-where execution speed and computational efficiency are critical-the SMC-HOCBF framework constitutes a strong candidate for safety-critical control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address safety concerns in dynamical systems using Gaussian-process-learned dynamics, leveraging energy constraints for mechanical systems to guide safety-aware control.

Method: The authors develop a Bayesian-CBF framework with energy-aware Bayesian-CBFs (EB-CBFs) that utilize Hamiltonian and vector-field posteriors from Gaussian processes to design probabilistic safety filters minimally altering nominal controllers.

Result: Numerical simulations on a mass-spring system confirm the EB-CBFs' capability to ensure safety with high probability in the context of noisy GP-learned dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed energy-aware Bayesian-CBF framework provides effective safety guarantees for dynamical systems by exploiting Gaussian process posteriors and energy barriers in simulations.

Abstract: We study safe control for dynamical systems whose continuous-time dynamics are learned with Gaussian processes (GPs), focusing on mechanical and port-Hamiltonian systems where safety is naturally expressed via energy constraints. The availability of a GP Hamiltonian posterior naturally raises the question of how to systematically exploit this structure to design an energy-aware control barrier function with high-probability safety guarantees. We address this problem by developing a Bayesian-CBF framework and instantiating it with energy-aware Bayesian-CBFs (EB-CBFs) that construct conservative energy-based barriers directly from the Hamiltonian and vector-field posteriors, yielding safety filters that minimally modify a nominal controller while providing probabilistic energy safety guarantees. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring system demonstrate that the proposed EB-CBFs achieve high-probability safety under noisy sampled GP-learned dynamics.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method using graph neural networks (GNNs) to address challenges in reconstructing missing PMU data in wide-area measurement systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PMU measurement data in WAMS suffers from missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks, and existing methods struggle with concept drift, robustness under high missing rates, and unrealistic assumptions of full observability.

Method: The proposed method leverages K-hop graph neural networks for direct learning on subgraphs of PMU nodes and designs a complementary auxiliary learning framework with spatial-temporal and auxiliary GNNs to reconstruct missing data while achieving unsupervised online learning.

Result: The proposed method showed superior performance in reconstructing PMU data under conditions of high missing rates and incomplete observability, through numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The ATL method improves data reconstruction robustness and adaptability in WAMS environments, overcoming limitations of previous techniques.

Abstract: In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the black-box nature of data-driven physics models like GraphCast, exploring if their internal representations are interpretable and physically consistent for improved trustworthiness.

Method: The study uses sparse autoencoders and interpretability tools from Large Language Models to analyze neuron space and computational layers in GraphCast. It identifies features and performs interventions to evaluate their abstraction.

Result: Interpretable features for various phenomena (tropical cyclones, seasonal behavior, sea-ice extent), are discovered. Feature-specific interventions lead to consistent and scientifically relevant modifications in model predictions.

Conclusion: These methods significantly enhance understanding of data-driven physics models, providing insights into their accuracy and utility while improving their reliability for scientific applications.

Abstract: Large data-driven physics models like DeepMind's weather model GraphCast have empirically succeeded in parameterizing time operators for complex dynamical systems with an accuracy reaching or in some cases exceeding that of traditional physics-based solvers. Unfortunately, how these data-driven models perform computations is largely unknown and whether their internal representations are interpretable or physically consistent is an open question. Here, we adapt tools from interpretability research in Large Language Models to analyze intermediate computational layers in GraphCast, leveraging sparse autoencoders to discover interpretable features in the neuron space of the model. We uncover distinct features on a wide range of length and time scales that correspond to tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, diurnal and seasonal behavior, large-scale precipitation patterns, specific geographical coding, and sea-ice extent, among others. We further demonstrate how the precise abstraction of these features can be probed via interventions on the prediction steps of the model. As a case study, we sparsely modify a feature corresponding to tropical cyclones in GraphCast and observe interpretable and physically consistent modifications to evolving hurricanes. Such methods offer a window into the black-box behavior of data-driven physics models and are a step towards realizing their potential as trustworthy predictors and scientifically valuable tools for discovery.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of scrape-off layer (SOL) and divertor-edge dynamics is vital for designing plasma-facing components in fusion devices. High-fidelity edge fluid/neutral codes such as SOLPS-ITER capture SOL physics with high accuracy, but their computational cost limits broad parameter scans and long transient studies. We present transformer-based, autoregressive surrogates for efficient prediction of 2D, time-dependent plasma edge state fields. Trained on SOLPS-ITER spatiotemporal data, the surrogates forecast electron temperature, electron density, and radiated power over extended horizons. We evaluate model variants trained with increasing autoregressive horizons (1-100 steps) on short- and long-horizon prediction tasks. Longer-horizon training systematically improves rollout stability and mitigates error accumulation, enabling stable predictions over hundreds to thousands of steps and reproducing key dynamical features such as the motion of high-radiation regions. Measured end-to-end wall-clock times show the surrogate is orders of magnitude faster than SOLPS-ITER, enabling rapid parameter exploration. Prediction accuracy degrades when the surrogate enters physical regimes not represented in the training dataset, motivating future work on data enrichment and physics-informed constraints. Overall, this approach provides a fast, accurate surrogate for computationally intensive plasma edge simulations, supporting rapid scenario exploration, control-oriented studies, and progress toward real-time applications in fusion devices.

### [455] [The Impact of LLMs on Online News Consumption and Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24968)
*Hangcheng Zhao,Ron Berman*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of large language models (LLMs) on news publishers, focusing on changes in traffic, employment, and content production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how LLMs, with their role in data crawling, content generation, and consumer information, affect news publishers' business, content creation, and audience behaviors.

Method: The study uses high-frequency granular data, implementing a difference-in-differences approach to measure the effects of blocking LLM bots and analyzing hiring trends and content strategies.

Result: 1. News publishers experienced moderate declines in traffic after August 2024. 2. Blocking LLM bots led to traffic declines (23% total, 14% real consumer). 3. LLMs have not yet replaced editorial jobs; hiring trends for these roles increased. 4. Publishers shifted towards rich content and advanced advertising technologies rather than generating more text.

Conclusion: LLMs are affecting news consumption and production in unexpected ways, highlighting both challenges and adaptation strategies for publishers, though editorial jobs remain unaffected for now.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news "slop." Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.
  Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.
  Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing relevance benchmarks lack complexity and standardized evaluation metrics, limiting effective assessment of models in web e-commerce scenarios.

Method: The authors propose RAIR, a new benchmark with three subsets (general, long-tail hard, and visual salience) derived from real-world scenarios to evaluate fundamental, limit-challenging, and multimodal capabilities of models.

Result: Experiments using 14 open and closed-source models revealed that RAIR is challenging even for GPT-5, highlighting its effectiveness as a benchmark.

Conclusion: RAIR provides a robust and standardized framework for relevance evaluation in web e-commerce, contributing valuable insights for LLM and VLM in both research and industry.

Abstract: Search relevance plays a central role in web e-commerce. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant results on relevance task, existing benchmarks lack sufficient complexity for comprehensive model assessment, resulting in an absence of standardized relevance evaluation metrics across the industry. To address this limitation, we propose Rule-Aware benchmark with Image for Relevance assessment(RAIR), a Chinese dataset derived from real-world scenarios. RAIR established a standardized framework for relevance assessment and provides a set of universal rules, which forms the foundation for standardized evaluation. Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance. RAIR data are now available, serving as an industry benchmark for relevance assessment while providing new insights into general LLM and Visual Language Model(VLM) evaluation.

### [459] [HiGR: Efficient Generative Slate Recommendation via Hierarchical Planning and Multi-Objective Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24787)
*Yunsheng Pang,Zijian Liu,Yudong Li,Shaojie Zhu,Zijian Luo,Chenyun Yu,Sikai Wu,Shichen Shen,Cong Xu,Bin Wang,Kai Jiang,Hongyong Yu,Chengxiang Zhuo,Zang Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiGR, a generative framework for slate recommendation that improves both efficiency and recommendation quality through hierarchical planning and listwise preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and quality of slate recommendation systems by addressing issues in existing approaches such as semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential slate decoding.

Method: HiGR uses hierarchical planning, decoupling global slate planning and specific item selection. It tokenizes items using an auto-encoder with residual quantization and contrastive constraints. Additionally, it employs a listwise preference alignment objective based on implicit user feedback for optimizing slate quality.

Result: HiGR achieves significant improvements in slate recommendation. It reports over 10% better offline recommendation quality and a fivefold inference speedup over state-of-the-art methods. Online A/B testing shows a 1.22% increase in Average Watch Time and 1.73% in Average Video Views.

Conclusion: HiGR effectively enhances the performance of slate recommendation systems by addressing tokenization inefficiencies and introducing techniques for better slate planning and quality alignment, proven in both offline and online evaluations.

Abstract: Slate recommendation, where users are presented with a ranked list of items simultaneously, is widely adopted in online platforms. Recent advances in generative models have shown promise in slate recommendation by modeling sequences of discrete semantic IDs autoregressively. However, existing autoregressive approaches suffer from semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential decoding that lacks holistic slate planning. To address these limitations, we propose HiGR, an efficient generative slate recommendation framework that integrates hierarchical planning with listwise preference alignment. First, we propose an auto-encoder utilizing residual quantization and contrastive constraints to tokenize items into semantically structured IDs for controllable generation. Second, HiGR decouples generation into a list-level planning stage for global slate intent, followed by an item-level decoding stage for specific item selection. Third, we introduce a listwise preference alignment objective to directly optimize slate quality using implicit user feedback. Experiments on our large-scale commercial media platform demonstrate that HiGR delivers consistent improvements in both offline evaluations and online deployment. Specifically, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in offline recommendation quality with a 5x inference speedup, while further achieving a 1.22% and 1.73% increase in Average Watch Time and Average Video Views in online A/B tests.

### [460] [Quantitative Understanding of PDF Fits and their Uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24116)
*Amedeo Chiefa,Luigi Del Debbio,Richard Kenway*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of neural networks for Parton Distribution Functions (PDF) determination, focusing on understanding and diagnosing training dynamics using the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As collider experiments, particularly at the LHC, demand higher precision, there is a need for robust and accurate PDF determinations with reliable uncertainty quantification.

Method: The study develops a theoretical framework using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyze and quantify the training dynamics of neural networks applied to PDFs, assessing both the architecture's role and data contribution.

Result: An analytical understanding of the training process is achieved, enabling clear insights into uncertainty propagation and providing tools to validate fitting methodologies.

Conclusion: The framework offers a powerful diagnostic for improving the robustness of PDF fitting methodologies and serves as a link between machine learning theory and applications in particle physics.

Abstract: Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) play a central role in describing experimental data at colliders and provide insight into the structure of nucleons. As the LHC enters an era of high-precision measurements, a robust PDF determination with a reliable uncertainty quantification has become mandatory in order to match the experimental precision. The NNPDF collaboration has pioneered the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for PDF determinations, using Neural Networks (NNs) to parametrise the unknown PDFs in a flexible and unbiased way. The NNs are then trained on experimental data by means of stochastic gradient descent algorithms. The statistical robustness of the results is validated by extensive closure tests using synthetic data. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyse the training dynamics of neural networks. This approach allows us to derive, under precise assumptions, an analytical description of the neural network evolution during training, enabling a quantitative understanding of the training process. Having an analytical handle on the training dynamics allows us to clarify the role of the NN architecture and the impact of the experimental data in a transparent way. Similarly, we are able to describe the evolution of the covariance of the NN output during training, providing a quantitative description of how uncertainties are propagated from the data to the fitted function. While our results are not a substitute for PDF fitting, they do provide a powerful diagnostic tool to assess the robustness of current fitting methodologies. Beyond its relevance for particle physics phenomenology, our analysis of PDF determinations provides a testbed to apply theoretical ideas about the learning process developed in the ML community.

### [461] [Virasoro Symmetry in Neural Network Field Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24420)
*Brandon Robinson*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Neural Network Field Theory (NN-FT) framework that realizes the full Virasoro symmetry of 2D Conformal Field Theories (CFTs), verified through numerical and analytical studies, and extends to superconformal symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of Neural Network Field Theories that, while realizing global conformal symmetries, fail to encode local stress-energy tensors necessary for full conformal symmetry such as Virasoro symmetry in 2D CFTs.

Method: The authors construct a neural free boson theory with an appropriate architecture and parameter distribution to encode a local stress tensor. This approach is extended to model Majorana Fermion and $N=(1,1)$ scalar multiplets, enabling the inclusion of super-Virasoro symmetry.

Result: The results confirm that the proposed NN-FT framework successfully encodes the full Virasoro symmetry, computes central charges and scaling dimensions, and extends the methodology to super-conformal and boundary NN-FTs.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new architecture for NN-FTs that can model 2D CFTs with full Virasoro and super-conformal symmetries, presenting a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Neural Network Field Theories (NN-FTs) can realize global conformal symmetries via embedding space architectures. These models describe Generalized Free Fields (GFFs) in the infinite width limit. However, they typically lack a local stress-energy tensor satisfying conformal Ward identities. This presents an obstruction to realizing infinite-dimensional, local conformal symmetry typifying 2d Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). We present the first construction of an NN-FT that encodes the full Virasoro symmetry of a 2d CFT. We formulate a neural free boson theory with a local stress tensor $T(z)$ by properly choosing the architecture and prior distribution of network parameters. We verify the analytical results through numerical simulation; computing the central charge and the scaling dimensions of vertex operators. We then construct an NN realization of a Majorana Fermion and an $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ scalar multiplet, which then enables an extension of the formalism to include super-Virasoro symmetry. Finally, we extend the framework by constructing boundary NN-FTs that preserve (super-)conformal symmetry via the method of images.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper reviews muscle synergies during running using sEMG data, addressing control theories, decomposition methods, modulation by external factors, and clinical implications. Future work should address methodological standardization and translational application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance understanding of neuromuscular control and lower-limb coordination during running, utilizing muscle synergy analysis to explore its applications in sports biomechanics, training, and rehabilitation.

Method: The review synthesizes research findings, decomposition methods (e.g., PCA, ICA, FA, NMF, autoencoders), and examines the influence of factors like surface, speed, fatigue, and pathologies on synergy patterns.

Result: The findings suggest stability in the number and structure of synergies while showing plasticity in muscle weightings and motor primitives under varying conditions, with identified methodological variability in sEMG analysis.

Conclusion: Advances in muscle synergy analysis require standardized methods, multi-source data integration, and longitudinal studies to improve applications in sports science and medicine.

Abstract: Running is a fundamental form of human locomotion and a key task for evaluating neuromuscular control and lower-limb coordination. In recent years, muscle synergy analysis based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has become an important approach in this area. This review focuses on muscle synergies during running, outlining core neural control theories and biomechanical optimization hypotheses, summarizing commonly used decomposition methods (e.g., PCA, ICA, FA, NMF) and emerging autoencoder-based approaches. We synthesize findings on the development and evolution of running-related synergies across the lifespan, examine how running surface, speed, foot-strike pattern, fatigue, and performance level modulate synergy patterns, and describe characteristic alterations in populations with knee osteoarthritis, patellofemoral pain, and stroke. Current evidence suggests that the number and basic structure of lower-limb synergies during running are relatively stable, whereas spatial muscle weightings and motor primitives are highly plastic and sensitive to task demands, fatigue, and pathology. However, substantial methodological variability remains in EMG channel selection, preprocessing pipelines, and decomposition algorithms, and direct neurophysiological validation and translational application are still limited. Future work should prioritize standardized processing protocols, integration of multi-source neuromusculoskeletal data, nonlinear modeling, and longitudinal intervention studies to better exploit muscle synergy analysis in sports biomechanics, athletic training, and rehabilitation medicine.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an autonomous stabilization method for semiconductor quantum-dot qubits using charge stability diagrams to improve performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenges of electrostatic drift and charge noise in semiconductor quantum-dot qubits, which limit scalability and performance and make manual recalibration impractical in larger arrays.

Method: Utilizing charge stability diagrams as multidimensional probes, the method tracks charge transitions, detects voltage drifts, identifies abrupt charge changes, and applies compensations to stabilize conditions.

Result: The method was applied to a 10-QD device, demonstrating robust stabilization, noise process diagnostics, and noise spectral analysis. The study identified noise characteristics such as $1/f^2$ drift and a linear correlation length.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization modules in quantum-dot-based quantum processors, ensuring stable and high-fidelity qubit operations over long durations.

Abstract: The performance and scalability of semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) qubits are limited by electrostatic drift and charge noise that shift operating points and destabilize qubit parameters. As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$μ$\si{\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \pm 38)$~\si{\nano\meter} in the device. These capabilities form the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit operations.

*Krishna Kumar*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: Deep learning methods like PINNs, DeepONet, and GNS face significant challenges in geotechnical applications compared to traditional solvers in terms of speed, training demands, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the efficacy of emerging deep learning-based methods against traditional solvers for key geotechnical problems.

Method: Conducted benchmarks using canonical problems (wave propagation and beam-foundation interaction) to compare neural networks like PINNs, DeepONet, and GNS against traditional approaches.

Result: PINNs are significantly slower and less accurate; DeepONet requires extensive training and is inefficient for practical use; GNS faces scalability and behavior capture issues; inverse solvers using automatic differentiation showed superior efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: Traditional solvers outperform deep learning methods in most geotechnical cases, except under specific conditions like high computational expense or limited prediction envelopes.

Abstract: Deep learning methods -- physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), deep operator networks (DeepONet), and graph network simulators (GNS) -- are increasingly proposed for geotechnical problems. This paper tests these methods against traditional solvers on canonical problems: wave propagation and beam-foundation interaction. PINNs run 90,000 times slower than finite difference with larger errors. DeepONet requires thousands of training simulations and breaks even only after millions of evaluations. Multi-layer perceptrons fail catastrophically when extrapolating beyond training data -- the common case in geotechnical prediction. GNS shows promise for geometry-agnostic simulation but faces scaling limits and cannot capture path-dependent soil behavior. For inverse problems, automatic differentiation through traditional solvers recovers material parameters with sub-percent accuracy in seconds. We recommend: use automatic differentiation for inverse problems; apply site-based cross-validation to account for spatial autocorrelation; reserve neural networks for problems where traditional solvers are genuinely expensive and predictions remain within the training envelope. When a method is four orders of magnitude slower with less accuracy, it is not a viable replacement for proven solvers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Modular Entanglement Hub (ModEn-Hub) for scaling quantum computing across multiple QPUs, demonstrating significant teleportation success and efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of single-device quantum computing by networking multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) into a cohesive high-performance computing (HPC) system.

Method: The paper proposes the ModEn-Hub architecture, featuring a hub-and-spoke photonic interconnect with a quantum network orchestrator for efficient entanglement delivery and management. A Monte Carlo simulation compares its performance against a baseline approach.

Result: The ModEn-Hub achieves about 90% teleportation success across up to 128 QPUs, while the baseline drops to about 30%, with the trade-off being increased entanglement attempts.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that adaptive resource orchestration in the ModEn-Hub enables scalable and efficient quantum-HPC systems, supporting robust multi-QPU operations on near-term hardware.

Abstract: Scaling quantum computing beyond a single device requires networking many quantum processing units (QPUs) into a coherent quantum-HPC system. We propose the Modular Entanglement Hub (ModEn-Hub) architecture: a hub-and-spoke photonic interconnect paired with a real-time quantum network orchestrator. ModEn-Hub centralizes entanglement sources and shared quantum memory to deliver on-demand, high-fidelity Bell pairs across heterogeneous QPUs, while the control plane schedules teleportation-based non-local gates, launches parallel entanglement attempts, and maintains a small ebit cache. To quantify benefits, we implement a lightweight, reproducible Monte Carlo study under realistic loss and tight round budgets, comparing a naive sequential baseline to an orchestrated policy with logarithmically scaled parallelism and opportunistic caching. Across 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub-style orchestration sustains about 90% teleportation success while the baseline degrades toward about 30%, at the cost of higher average entanglement attempts (about 10-12 versus about 3). These results provide clear, high-level evidence that adaptive resource orchestration in the ModEn-Hub enables scalable and efficient quantum-HPC operation on near-term hardware.

*Seyed Mohamad Ali Tousi,Adib Bazgir,Yuwen Zhang,G. N. DeSouza*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with machine-learned error mitigation to solve the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, achieving improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitation of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices in solving partial differential equations with accuracy necessitates a framework for mitigating quantum noise and improving simulation performance.

Method: A hybrid quantum-classical framework is developed, utilizing the Cole-Hopf transformation for Burgers equation mapping, Trotterized quantum circuits for time evolution, zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), and an attention-based graph neural network for learned error mitigation.

Result: Quantum simulations were successfully executed on IBM devices and matched against high-accuracy classical solutions, demonstrating reduced errors and improved predictions through learned error mitigation beyond ZNE alone.

Conclusion: Learned error mitigation, combined with physics-based noise-reduction strategies, enhances the performance of quantum PDE solvers on NISQ devices and can be generalized to other complex systems.

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices.

*Wenbo Qiao,Peng Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Quantum Inference Model (Q-VWSD) for Visual Word Sense Disambiguation, addressing semantic bias and uncertainty issues using a quantum superposition-inspired approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle semantic bias and uncertainty in visual word sense disambiguation caused by the limitations of glosses from differing sources in current methods.

Method: The proposed Q-VWSD uses quantum-inspired superposition to encode multiple glosses of a target word, executed on a quantum circuit to reduce semantic biases, and includes a heuristic version that runs efficiently on classical computers.

Result: The experiments demonstrated that Q-VWSD surpasses state-of-the-art classical methods, especially by using glosses from large language models.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of quantum machine learning for real-world applications and shows the feasibility of adapting quantum modeling to classical computing environments while quantum hardware is still developing.

Abstract: Visual word sense disambiguation focuses on polysemous words, where candidate images can be easily confused. Traditional methods use classical probability to calculate the likelihood of an image matching each gloss of the target word, summing these to form a posterior probability. However, due to the challenge of semantic uncertainty, glosses from different sources inevitably carry semantic biases, which can lead to biased disambiguation results. Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of the target word into a superposition state to mitigate semantic biases. Then, the quantum circuit is executed, and the results are observed. By formalizing our method, we find that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of the method based on classical probability. Building on this, we further designed a heuristic version of Q-VWSD that can run more efficiently on classical computing. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classical methods, particularly by effectively leveraging non-specialized glosses from large language models, which further enhances performance. Our approach showcases the potential of quantum machine learning in practical applications and provides a case for leveraging quantum modeling advantages on classical computers while quantum hardware remains immature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the issue of limited portability in tensor network applications caused by the lack of standardized interfaces across tensor-computing frameworks.

Method: The researchers developed TCI with a well-defined type system and a core set of functions for tensor manipulations and linear algebra operations. They conducted numerical demonstrations and released an open-source implementation.

Result: TCI enables seamless migration of tensor-network applications across hardware/software platforms while delivering performance comparable to native implementations.

Conclusion: The open-source TCI proves to be practical, simplifying integration with existing frameworks and facilitating unified, high-performance tensor computation.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) are a central computational tool in quantum science and artificial intelligence. However, the lack of unified software interface across tensor-computing frameworks severely limits the portability of TN applications, coupling algorithmic development to specific hardware and software back ends. To address this challenge, we introduce the Tensor Computing Interface (TCI) -- an application-oriented, lightweight application programming interface designed to enable framework-independent, high-performance TN applications. TCI provides a well-defined type system that abstracts tensor objects together with a minimal yet expressive set of core functions covering essential tensor manipulations and tensor linear-algebra operations. Through numerical demonstrations on representative tensor-network applications, we show that codes written against TCI can be migrated seamlessly across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms while achieving performance comparable to native framework implementations. We further release an open-source implementation of TCI based on \textit{Cytnx}, demonstrating its practicality and ease of integration with existing tensor-computing frameworks.

### [469] [One-Shot Structured Pruning of Quantum Neural Networks via $q$-Group Engineering and Quantum Geometric Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24019)
*Haijian Shao,Wei Liu,Xing Deng,Yingtao Jiang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces q-iPrune, a structured pruning framework for quantum neural networks (QNNs) that reduces gate-level redundancy while mitigating performance degradation, suitable for noisy quantum devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of gate-level redundancy in QNNs, which impedes their implementation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

Method: The method involves q-iPrune, which prunes gates using a task-conditioned $q$-overlap distance based on algebraic structures and quantum geometry, ensuring only redundant gates are removed through theoretical guarantees.

Result: q-iPrune successfully reduces gates significantly in QNNs while ensuring hardware- and noise-adapted pruning and maintaining bounded task performance degradation.

Conclusion: The proposed pruning framework offers computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees for redundancy management, and practical applicability, making QNNs more viable for NISQ device deployment.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) suffer from severe gate-level redundancy, which hinders their deployment on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose q-iPrune, a one-shot structured pruning framework grounded in the algebraic structure of $q$-deformed groups and task-conditioned quantum geometry.
  Unlike prior heuristic or gradient-based pruning methods, q-iPrune formulates redundancy directly at the gate level. Each gate is compared within an algebraically consistent subgroup using a task-conditioned $q$-overlap distance, which measures functional similarity through state overlaps on a task-relevant ensemble. A gate is removed only when its replacement by a subgroup representative provably induces a bounded deviation on all task observables.
  We establish three rigorous theoretical guarantees. First, we prove completeness of redundancy pruning: no gate that violates the prescribed similarity threshold is removed. Second, we show that the pruned circuit is functionally equivalent up to an explicit, task-conditioned error bound, with a closed-form dependence on the redundancy tolerance and the number of replaced gates. Third, we prove that the pruning procedure is computationally feasible, requiring only polynomial-time comparisons and avoiding exponential enumeration over the Hilbert space.
  To adapt pruning decisions to hardware imperfections, we introduce a noise-calibrated deformation parameter $λ$ that modulates the $q$-geometry and redundancy tolerance. Experiments on standard quantum machine learning benchmarks demonstrate that q-iPrune achieves substantial gate reduction while maintaining bounded task performance degradation, consistent with our theoretical guarantees.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to expand the capabilities of computational arts by merging quantum algorithms to achieve innovative artistic effects.

Method: Develop and apply variational quantum algorithms for two brushes: Steerable (utilizing quantum geometric control theory) and Chemical (mimicking molecular eigensolver techniques).

Result: Two quantum-based brushes were implemented successfully, integrated with artistic frameworks, and released as open-source software.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the application of quantum computing to artistic tools and advances in algorithmic integration to enable novel creative possibilities.

Abstract: Quantum brushes are computational arts software introduced by Ferreira et al (2025) that leverage quantum behavior to generate novel artistic effects. In this outreach paper, we introduce the mathematical framework and describe the implementation of two quantum brushes based on variational quantum algorithms, Steerable and Chemical. While Steerable uses quantum geometric control theory to merge two works of art, Chemical mimics variational eigensolvers for estimating molecular ground energies to evolve colors on an underlying canvas. The implementation of both brushes is available open-source at https://github.com/moth-quantum/QuantumBrush and is fully compatible with the original quantum brushes.

*Shuvro Chowdhury,Jasper Pieterse,Navid Anjum Aadit,Johan H. Mentink,Kerem Y. Camsari*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study develops neural quantum states using sparse Boltzmann machines combined with probabilistic hardware for efficient Monte Carlo sampling, addressing scaling challenges in large systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural quantum states face scalability issues due to the computational cost of Monte Carlo sampling for large system sizes.

Method: Sparse Boltzmann machine architectures were paired with probabilistic computing hardware (FPGA-based) to speed up sampling. A dual-sampling algorithm was introduced to train deep Boltzmann machines efficiently.

Result: Accurate ground-state energies for 80×80 spin lattices were achieved with multi-FPGA clusters. Deep Boltzmann machines were trained for systems with 35×35 spins, improving parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Probabilistic computing hardware resolves the sampling bottleneck, enabling simulations of larger quantum systems and deeper neural architectures.

Abstract: Neural quantum states efficiently represent many-body wavefunctions with neural networks, but the cost of Monte Carlo sampling limits their scaling to large system sizes. Here we address this challenge by combining sparse Boltzmann machine architectures with probabilistic computing hardware. We implement a probabilistic computer on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and use it as a fast sampler for energy-based neural quantum states. For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures.

### [472] [Limits of quantum generative models with classical sampling hardness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24801)
*Sabrina Herbst,Ivona Brandić,Adrián Pérez-Salinas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses quantum generative models' ability to create classically hard distributions but identifies that anticoncentrating distributions, which lead to quantum advantage, are untrainable. Sparse distributions are easier to train and allow surrogate classical sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the power and limitations of quantum computers for generative modeling, focusing on their ability to replicate complex probability distributions underlying datasets where quantum advantage is observed.

Method: The study examines quantum generative models, analyzing their output distributions, with emphasis on anticoncentration and sparsity properties. Theoretical and practical implications for training these models were also explored.

Result: The paper finds that models producing anticoncentrating distributions (associated with quantum advantage) are inherently untrainable. Conversely, models generating sparse distributions are trainable and enable the use of classical surrogate algorithms.

Conclusion: While quantum generative models offer potential for quantum advantage, it cannot rely on anticoncentration. Alternative sources of advantage in these models warrant investigation.

Abstract: Sampling tasks have been successful in establishing quantum advantages both in theory and experiments. This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration.

### [473] [Policy Mirror Descent with Temporal Difference Learning: Sample Complexity under Online Markov Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24056)
*Wenye Li,Hongxu Chen,Jiacai Liu,Ke Wei*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the sample complexity of policy mirror descent (PMD) in reinforcement learning with temporal difference learning and Markovian sampling models, introducing two novel algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sample complexity analysis for policy mirror descent under realistic scenarios like Markovian sampling, without pre-specified accuracy for action values.

Method: Two algorithms are introduced: Expected TD-PMD (off-policy) and Approximate TD-PMD (mixed policy), analyzing their performance for different step size configurations.

Result: Using small constant step sizes, the average-time sample complexity is shown to be $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$. With adaptive step sizes, the sample complexity improves to $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$.

Conclusion: These findings provide a framework for more efficient policy optimization in reinforcement learning, broadening practical and theoretical applications.

Abstract: This paper studies the policy mirror descent (PMD) method, which is a general policy optimization framework in reinforcement learning and can cover a wide range of policy gradient methods by specifying difference mirror maps. Existing sample complexity analysis for policy mirror descent either focuses on the generative sampling model, or the Markovian sampling model but with the action values being explicitly approximated to certain pre-specified accuracy. In contrast, we consider the sample complexity of policy mirror descent with temporal difference (TD) learning under the Markovian sampling model. Two algorithms called Expected TD-PMD and Approximate TD-PMD have been presented, which are off-policy and mixed policy algorithms respectively. Under a small enough constant policy update step size, the $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (a logarithm factor about $\varepsilon$ is hidden in $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$) sample complexity can be established for them to achieve average-time $\varepsilon$-optimality. The sample complexity is further improved to $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (without the hidden logarithm factor) to achieve the last-iterate $\varepsilon$-optimality based on adaptive policy update step sizes.

### [474] [A New Decomposition Paradigm for Graph-structured Nonlinear Programs via Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24676)
*Kuangyu Ding,Marie Maros,Gesualdo Scutari*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces MP-Jacobi, a decentralized optimization framework for finite-sum nonlinear programs using message passing and Jacobi updates, proving its convergence and scalability with theoretical and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient decentralized frameworks for solving nonlinear programs where decision variables interact locally according to a graph or hypergraph, particularly in the context of computational and communication efficiency.

Method: MP-Jacobi combines min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates. It partitions the (hyper)graph into tree clusters, enabling cluster-level subproblem updates through intra-cluster cost-to-go messages and inter-cluster Jacobi corrections. Surrogate-based updates reduce complexity while preserving convergence.

Result: The paper proves global linear convergence with explicit rates in strongly convex objectives, showcasing how graph properties and clustering impact scalability. It extends the method to hypergraphs with efficient schemes and demonstrates performance improvements in experiments.

Conclusion: MP-Jacobi is an effective and scalable decentralized optimization method for graph and hypergraph-structured problems, balancing convergence guarantees, computational efficiency, and scalability.

Abstract: We study finite-sum nonlinear programs whose decision variables interact locally according to a graph or hypergraph. We propose MP-Jacobi (Message Passing-Jacobi), a graph-compliant decentralized framework that couples min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters. At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving a cluster subproblem whose objective decomposes into (i) an intra-cluster term evaluated by a single min-sum sweep on the cluster tree (cost-to-go messages) and (ii) inter-cluster couplings handled via a Jacobi correction using neighbors' latest iterates. This design uses only single-hop communication and yields a convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.
  For strongly convex objectives we establish global linear convergence and explicit rates that quantify how curvature, coupling strength, and the chosen partition affect scalability and provide guidance for clustering. To mitigate the computation and communication cost of exact message updates, we develop graph-compliant surrogates that preserve convergence while reducing per-iteration complexity. We further extend MP-Jacobi to hypergraphs; in heavily overlapping regimes, a surrogate-based hyperedge-splitting scheme restores finite-time intra-cluster message updates and maintains convergence. Experiments validate the theory and show consistent improvements over decentralized gradient baselines.
