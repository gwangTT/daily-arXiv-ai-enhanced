However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation.

This setting\nnaturally raises fundamental questions: {\\it What kinds of additional\nsupervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\\it how do they contribute to\nimproved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a\ntheoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision\nas probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine\ncombination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of\nadditional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,\nbut rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled\nclasses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the\nmixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary\nroles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision\ndetermines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing\nthe hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the\nmixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through\ngeneralization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional\nsupervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and\nasymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate\nthat, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to\nimproved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper focuses on improving classification models when training data is limited by incorporating additional supervision beyond hard labels, like confidence scores.", "motivation": "In the context of limited training data, using additional label supervision can potentially improve the accuracy of classification models.
