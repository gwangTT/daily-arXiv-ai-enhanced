### [1] [A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)
*Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a formal conjecture about a trade-off between AI's provable correctness and its capacity for broad data mapping, along with its implications for AI design and governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and make explicit the trade-off in AI systems between provable correctness and their capacity to handle high-dimensional data, which impacts AI's trustworthiness and usability.

Method: The conjecture is framed in information-theoretic terms, contextualized in epistemology and verification debates, and analyzed for its philosophical and practical consequences.

Result: The analysis reveals how the conjecture could redefine standards for AI evaluation, governance, and hybrid designs, highlighting its role in addressing epistemic risks and moral responsibilities.

Conclusion: Proving or refuting this conjecture is critical for ensuring trustworthy AI systems, potentially influencing their development and governance frameworks.

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

### [2] [One Patient, Many Contexts: Scaling Medical AI Through Contextual Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10157)
*Michelle M. Li,Ben Y. Reis,Adam Rodman,Tianxi Cai,Noa Dagan,Ran D. Balicer,Joseph Loscalzo,Isaac S. Kohane,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of medical foundation models capable of dynamically adapting to diverse clinical scenarios without retraining, aiming to minimize errors and enhance healthcare accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI models face challenges in adapting dynamically to new populations, specialties, or contexts, leading to errors and inefficiencies in healthcare delivery.

Method: The paper outlines a vision for creating models that adjust reasoning dynamically, tackling context-specific challenges without requiring fine-tuning or retraining.

Result: A conceptual framework for context-switching AI is proposed to address the limitations of current models and optimize their utility across varied clinical settings.

Conclusion: Context-switching AI could significantly improve medical care by enabling models to adapt to diverse situations, thereby expanding access to healthcare and reducing errors.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

### [3] [LogiPlan: A Structured Benchmark for Logical Planning and Relational Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10527)
*Yanan Cai,Ahmed Salem,Besmira Nushi,Mark Russinovich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents LogiPlan, a novel benchmark to evaluate large language models' performance in logical planning and reasoning over complex relational structures, revealing performance gaps based on model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for assessing large language models' abilities in logical reasoning and complex relational planning, which are critical for applications involving structured data like knowledge bases and business processes.

Method: LogiPlan is designed with tasks like Plan Generation, Consistency Detection, and Comparison Question, along with self-correction assessments, providing dynamic variations in task complexity to evaluate model performance.

Result: The study tested state-of-the-art models like GPT-4.5 and Llama 3.1, uncovering that while models perform well on simpler tasks, they struggle with more intricate structures, indicating a gap in deep logical reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the limitations of current models in handling complex logical operations, offering insights for future developments in reasoning-enhanced language model architectures.

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

### [4] [Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179)
*Hamzah Dabool,Raghad Mustafa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study investigates causation versus correlation in Alzheimer's disease research through statistical and machine learning methods, identifying important features for disease classification and emphasizing the role of causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of causation versus correlation in AD research, which is essential for accurate diagnosis, treatment, and identifying disease drivers.

Method: Utilized correlation analysis, machine learning (XGBoost), and interpretability techniques (SHAP values) to analyze clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker data.

Result: Key AD classification features identified include cognitive scores and genetic risk factors; correlation matrices showed clusters of related variables, while SHAP explained feature contributions.

Conclusion: Strong correlations don't imply causation. Integrating statistical and interpretability methods aids in distinguishing causal factors, driving early diagnosis and targeted AD interventions.

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

### [5] [Towards Responsible AI: Advances in Safety, Fairness, and Accountability of Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10192)
*Filip Cano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses trustworthy AI, offering advancements in safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability of AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly impact critical societal domains, ensuring their responsible use is imperative, yet trustworthy AI remains a broad concept.

Method: It incorporates deterministic and probabilistic safety measures, fairness shields for sequential decision-making, and formal frameworks for accountability using quantitative metrics to assess agency and intention.

Result: The methods demonstrate effectiveness in simulated environments (e.g., autonomous vehicles) and propose frameworks for interpreting agency and responsibility.

Conclusion: These advancements unify under a formal framework, aiding in safer, fairer, and accountable AI systems while laying foundations for future trustworthy AI research.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

### [6] [WGSR-Bench: Wargame-based Game-theoretic Strategic Reasoning Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10264)
*Qiyue Yin,Pei Xu,Qiaozhe Li,Shengda Liu,Shengqi Shen,Tong Wang,Yihong Han,Xiaonan Zhao,Likun Yang,Shiyue Cao,Shiyu Qiu,Yuxuan Liu,Shizhao Yu,Lei Cui,Chengxin Yan,Jie Sun,Xiangquan Tang,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces WGSR-Bench, a strategy reasoning benchmark for evaluating the strategic reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in wargame scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs have shown remarkable progress in mathematical and commonsense reasoning, their ability to perform strategic reasoning in multi-agent dynamic environments remains unassessed.

Method: The paper proposes WGSR-Bench, a benchmarking framework using wargames to evaluate LLMs' multi-agent decision-making abilities through three tasks: situation awareness, risk modeling, and policy generation, forming the S-POE architecture.

Result: An LLM-based wargame agent is developed to comprehensively assess strategic reasoning abilities using WGSR-Bench.

Conclusion: WGSR-Bench offers a systematic way to evaluate strategic reasoning, filling a gap in LLM research and advancing the field of AI-driven strategic intelligence.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

### [7] [Closer to Language than Steam: AI as the Cognitive Engine of a New Productivity Revolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10281)
*Xinmin Fang,Lingfeng Tao,Zhengxiong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper frames AI as a cognitive revolution akin to written language, emphasizing its role in amplifying human intellect and driving productivity in knowledge work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reframe AI not just as a mechanized tool but as a transformative force augmenting human cognitive abilities and to draw parallels between AI and historical advances like written language.

Method: The authors adopt a multidisciplinary approach, integrating computer science, economic analysis, and sociological insights, along with conceptual frameworks demonstrating AI's role in shifting from manual to cognitive productivity.

Result: AI is shown to drive productivity in cognitive tasks across various domains and to act as an engine of cognition analogous to written language's historical impact.

Conclusion: AI complements human cognitive abilities and heralds a new paradigm in productivity, necessitating a rethinking of skills, organizational frameworks, and policies to align with its transformative potential.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

### [8] [The Alignment Trap: Complexity Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10304)
*Jasper Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Verification of AI safety becomes computationally intractable as system capabilities scale, with safety requirements increasingly demanding perfection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the computational limits of safety verification in increasingly capable AI systems to address alignment challenges.

Method: Four mathematical theorems prove the exponential growth in verification complexity, the diminishing safe policy fraction, the limitations of alignment techniques, and the measure-zero property of robust safety spaces for neural networks.

Result: Key results outline exponential verification complexity tied to system expressiveness, the scarcity of safe policies, and the intrinsic intractability of AI safety verification.

Conclusion: The work presents a strategic trilemma: limit complexity for verifiable safety, accept unverifiable risks, or innovate fundamentally new safety paradigms. These findings are crucial for future AI alignment strategies.

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

### [9] [A Benchmark for Generalizing Across Diverse Team Strategies in Competitive Pokémon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326)
*Cameron Angliss,Jiaxun Cui,Jiaheng Hu,Arrasy Rahman,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of robust multi-agent learning in multi-strategy AI systems by introducing VGC-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating AI in the Pokémon Video Game Championships (VGC) domain with extremely large strategy spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop AI agents capable of generalizing across dramatically different team and opponent configurations without retraining, particularly in complex and large strategic settings like Pokémon VGC.

Method: The authors propose VGC-Bench, which includes benchmarks, human-play datasets, various baselines (e.g., large-language-model agents, behavior cloning, reinforcement learning), and advanced game-theoretic methods. They evaluate these baselines in both restricted and scalability settings.

Result: The study finds that while existing methods perform well in restricted settings (e.g., single-team configurations, even defeating professional competitors), they fail to generalize effectively as the strategic team size grows.

Conclusion: Policy generalization in dynamic and combinatorial multi-agent strategy domains, like Pokémon VGC, remains an open challenge despite the contributions of VGC-Bench. Further research is required to address scalability issues.

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at
https://github.com/cameronangliss/VGC-Bench.

### [10] [Optimus-3: Towards Generalist Multimodal Minecraft Agents with Scalable Task Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10357)
*Zaijing Li,Yuquan Xie,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Weili Guan,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Optimus-3, a generalist agent for Minecraft, addressing challenges like data scarcity, task interference, and visual diversity with innovative data generation, MoE architecture, and reasoning-augmented reinforcement learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to build a generalist agent capable of perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in complex open-world environments like Minecraft, overcoming key challenges such as lack of specific data, task interference, and diverse visual inputs.

Method: The authors propose a knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for task-level routing, and a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning method to address the outlined challenges.

Result: The proposed agent, Optimus-3, outperforms both generalist multimodal large language models and state-of-the-art agents across a variety of Minecraft tasks, as demonstrated by experimental results.

Conclusion: Optimus-3 effectively tackles open-world challenges in Minecraft, showcasing its capabilities as a benchmark-setting generalist agent using innovative approaches.

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large
language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of
tasks in the Minecraft environment. Project page:

### [11] [NeuroPAL: Punctuated Anytime Learning with Neuroevolution for Macromanagement in Starcraft: Brood War](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10384)
*Jim O'Connor,Yeonghun Lee,Gary B Parker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroPAL, a combination of NEAT and Punctuated Anytime Learning, to enhance AI training efficiency in StarCraft: Brood War, achieving competitive results in half the training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of rule-based systems and supervised deep learning in StarCraft AI, which struggle with adaptability and computational efficiency, particularly in macromanagement and long-term strategy planning.

Method: The presented framework, NeuroPAL, integrates NEAT with Punctuated Anytime Learning (PAL), alternating between frequent low-fidelity and periodic high-fidelity evaluations to enhance sample efficiency during evolutionary training.

Result: NeuroPAL demonstrated significant improvements, reaching competitive gameplay levels in almost half the time compared to standard NEAT training, while showcasing emergent strategies like proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization.

Conclusion: Structured evaluation mechanisms like PAL can significantly enhance the scalability and effectiveness of neuroevolution in complex strategy environments, making it a promising approach for real-time strategy AI development.

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

*Yuquan Xie,Zaijing Li,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Kaiwen Zhou,Yinchuan Li,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mirage-1, a GUI agent leveraging hierarchical skills and a new tree search algorithm to improve efficiency and performance in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges posed by insufficient knowledge and domain gaps for GUI agents in long-horizon tasks within online environments.

Method: The authors introduce Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) for structured task planning and the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) to utilize offline-acquired skills in online domains.

Result: Mirage-1 significantly outperforms existing agents on multiple benchmarks, achieving up to 79% improvement on AndroidLH.

Conclusion: Mirage-1 demonstrates an innovative approach by combining hierarchical skill abstraction and efficient task exploration, marking progress in long-horizon tasks for GUI agents.

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

*Jintao Liang,Gang Su,Huifeng Lin,You Wu,Rui Zhao,Ziyue Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews the development of Reasoning Agentic RAG systems, which enhance retrieval-augmented generation by embedding adaptive reasoning and dynamic tool use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of static pipeline-based RAG systems in handling real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal capabilities.

Method: Categorize Reasoning Agentic RAG methods into predefined reasoning systems (fixed pipelines) and agentic reasoning systems (models autonomously manage tools). Analyze architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination in existing systems.

Result: Provided a comprehensive review and categorized representative techniques of Reasoning Agentic RAG systems, along with research challenges and future directions.

Conclusion: Reasoning Agentic RAG systems represent a promising area for advancing the flexibility, robustness, and applicability of retrieval-augmented generation frameworks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection

### [14] [Multi-dimensional Autoscaling of Processing Services: A Comparison of Agent-based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10420)
*Boris Sedlak,Alireza Furutanpey,Zihang Wang,Víctor Casamayor Pujol,Schahram Dustdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces an autoscaling framework using agents to manage constrained resources in edge computing, tested via four methods with varying strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autoscaling fails in edge computing due to resource limitations, demanding innovative solutions.

Method: Four scaling agents—Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference—were evaluated using YOLOv8 and OpenCV services in parallel.

Result: All agents achieved acceptable SLO performance with different convergence behaviors. Key strengths include Deep Q Network's pre-training, Structural Analysis's fast convergence, and Deep Active Inference's scalability.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling is feasible and effective for edge computing, suggesting promising future research opportunities.

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

TL;DR: OIBench introduces a challenging dataset for algorithmic reasoning, showcasing state-of-the-art models outperforming most humans but still below perfect solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the saturation point of traditional algorithm benchmarks and drive advancements in algorithmic reasoning.

Method: The authors created OIBench, a 250-problem dataset with diverse programming challenges, contamination-resistance validation, and proposed new efficiency metrics.

Result: Current SOTA models perform better than most human participants but are still suboptimal next to canonical solutions.

Conclusion: By releasing OIBench as an open resource, future progress in code reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be accelerated.

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm
benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more
challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.
This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging
olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original
problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a
comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities,
and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We
propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and
enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant
evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind
closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human
participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal
compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully
open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we
hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities
for future LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Scientists' First Exam (SFE), a benchmark to evaluate scientific reasoning in multimodal language models (MLLMs), revealing their current limitations and encouraging advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks primarily assess MLLMs' knowledge understanding but neglect their reasoning and perceptive abilities, creating a gap in evaluating their scientific cognitive skills.

Method: The SFE benchmark assesses MLLMs across three levels: scientific perception, understanding, and reasoning, using 830 VQA pairs spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five disciplines.

Result: Current state-of-the-art MLLMs, GPT-o3 and InternVL-3, achieve low scores (34.08% and 26.52%) on the SFE benchmark, highlighting substantial limitations.

Conclusion: SFE illustrates key deficiencies in MLLMs' scientific reasoning abilities, encouraging efforts to enhance their performance to support better AI-driven scientific discoveries.

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

*Mohd Anwar Jamal Faiz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence blending primality and digit-based rules, as a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' symbolic reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create an interpretable, rule-based testbed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in inferring hidden rules, validating mathematical hypotheses, and generalizing symbolic logic.

Method: The authors designed a deterministic sequence based on primality and prime suffixes, tested state-of-the-art LLMs on identifying the sequence rules, and evaluated hypothesis testing using a structured framework.

Result: The sequence provided insights into LLMs' abilities in rule inference accuracy, hypothesis validation, and generating extensive sequence terms, revealing their strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusion: The study proposed a novel benchmark for assessing symbolic reasoning in LLMs, bridging number theory, AI, and software engineering domains, and demonstrated its applicability through extensive testing.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

### [18] [Data Driven Diagnosis for Large Cyber-Physical-Systems with Minimal Prior Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10613)
*Henrik Sebastian Steude,Alexander Diedrich,Ingo Pill,Lukas Moddemann,Daniel Vranješ,Oliver Niggemann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diagnostic approach for cyber-physical systems that operates with minimal prior knowledge, combining neural networks for anomaly detection and a graph diagnosis algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing complex cyber-physical systems often requires extensive prior knowledge, which is challenging to obtain.

Method: The approach employs a neural network-based symptom generator for anomaly detection at the subsystem level and a graph diagnosis algorithm using minimal causal relationship information.

Result: Experiments showed that the method correctly included the true causal component in 82% of cases and reduced the search space in 73% of scenarios. Tests on real-world data further validated its practical utility.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates strong potential for diagnosing large, complex systems with minimal prior knowledge, making it valuable for practical applications.

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeleMath, a benchmark dataset with 500 QnA pairs targeting the evaluation of LLMs in solving domain-specific mathematical challenges in telecommunications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the gap in the effectiveness of LLMs within domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks, particularly in telecommunications areas like signal processing, network optimization, and performance analysis.

Method: The authors developed TeleMath, a dataset with 500 mathematical QnA pairs crafted by Subject Matter Experts, and used it to evaluate various open-source LLMs' capabilities in solving these problems.

Result: Recent LLMs designed for mathematical or logical reasoning performed best on TeleMath, while general-purpose models often struggled, highlighting the importance of domain-specific optimization.

Conclusion: TeleMath provides a valuable resource for benchmarking LLMs in mathematical problem-solving in telecommunications, encouraging further advancements and reproducibility in this area.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

*Tom Westermann,Aljosha Köcher,Felix Gehlhoff*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to formalize and verify AML modeling rules using ontologies, SHACL constraints, and Large Language Models for automatic validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of informal and textual constraints in AutomationML (AML), which cannot be automatically validated within AML itself.

Method: A pipeline is proposed where AML models are mapped to OWL ontologies using RML and SPARQL. Large Language Models translate textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are validated against the AML ontology. Validation results are interpreted automatically in natural language.

Result: The results show that complex AML modeling rules can be semi-automatically validated without requiring users to understand formal or ontology-based methods.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies AML modeling by enabling semi-automatic validation of complex constraints, enhancing usability and ensuring compliance with standards.

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a compiler, aspsmt2smt, for translating ASPMT programs into SMT solvable instances using gringo and z3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable the computation of stable models for ASPMT programs while integrating reasoning about continuous changes, especially real number computations.

Method: The authors develop a compiler named aspsmt2smt, which partially grounds input programs using the ASP grounder (gringo) and utilizes SMT solver (z3) for further processing.

Result: The proposed system successfully manages real number computations and facilitates reasoning about continuous changes in ASPMT programs.

Conclusion: The aspsmt2smt compiler provides a practical method for combining Answer Set Programming with Satisfiability Modulo Theories, expanding its applicability to real-world scenarios involving continuous data.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to enhance neuro-symbolic models for counterfactual reasoning in video dynamics using symbolic causal reasoning and achieves state-of-the-art results on CLEVRER and CRAFT benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of counterfactual reasoning in video dynamics, where existing neuro-symbolic models often underperform.

Method: The approach combines symbolic causal reasoning through causal graphs and Answer Set Programming (ASP) with enhanced neural modules, including leveraging GPT-3.5/4 for dynamics simulation.

Result: Enhanced neuro-symbolic models outperform state-of-the-art methods in counterfactual reasoning on CLEVRER benchmarks. Additionally, symbolic reasoning contributes to significant improvements on the CRAFT benchmark when paired with pre-trained language models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that symbolic reasoning enhances the ability of neuro-symbolic models to address counterfactual questions in video dynamics, presenting strong benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Motivation: The study aims to address the insufficient exploration of LLMs' ability to optimize solutions iteratively by learning from historical feedback.

Method: The authors developed OPT-BENCH, featuring 20 real-world Kaggle machine learning tasks and 10 classical NP problems, and created OPT-Agent, a framework leveraging human-like iterative reasoning through feedback.

Result: Extensive experiments on 9 LLMs from 6 model families revealed that using historical context notably improves optimization performance across ML and NP tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating iterative reasoning and historical feedback significantly enhances LLM-driven optimization, with open-sourced tools to encourage further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex
solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently
explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to enhance large language models (LLMs) for simulating human spatiotemporal behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional methods and challenges faced by LLMs in simulating spatiotemporal behaviors for urban planning.

Method: A five-stage cognitive reasoning framework combined with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools for data processing, applied in simulation experiments.

Result: Validated in Shanghai's Lujiazui district, the framework demonstrated high similarity to real mobility data, with generation efficiency significantly improved.

Conclusion: This framework advances synthetic mobility data generation and urban behavior modeling, offering contributions to urban planning and smart city applications.

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

Method: The proposed GenPlanX system integrates LLMs to interpret natural language descriptions of planning tasks with a classical AI planning engine and incorporates an execution and monitoring framework.

Result: GenPlanX demonstrates effectiveness in aiding users with office-related tasks, improving workflow and productivity through human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: GenPlanX highlights the potential of combining LLMs with traditional AI planning for practical, seamless task management.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex
tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when
provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of
planning tasks, LLMs have shown to be particularly good in interpreting human
intents among other uses. This paper introduces GenPlanX that integrates LLMs
for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToxiMol, a benchmark for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to repair molecular toxicity, along with a dataset and evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of systematic definitions and benchmarks for molecular toxicity repair in drug development motivated the creation of ToxiMol.

Method: The authors create a dataset of 560 toxic molecules with 11 tasks, design a prompt annotation pipeline using toxicological expertise, and propose ToxiEval, an automated evaluation system.

Result: Experimental results reveal that MLLMs show challenges but promising capabilities in toxicity comprehension, adherence to constraints, and molecule editing.

Conclusion: ToxiMol and ToxiEval establish a foundation for advancing MLLMs in molecular toxicity repair, addressing current gaps in the field.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves mathematical reasoning significantly in the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model, even when using spurious rewards unrelated to correct answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how RLVR can enhance reasoning capabilities in AI models, particularly in scenarios where reward signals are weak or spurious.

Method: The paper tests the impact of RLVR using a variety of spurious rewards on the mathematical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5-Math-7B and compares it to other models like Llama3 and OLMo2.

Result: RLVR achieved significant performance improvements (up to 27.1%) in Qwen2.5-Math-7B across various reward signals, but such gains were not consistent in other model families. Code reasoning emerged as a prominent behavior in the Qwen models after RLVR.

Conclusion: RLVR can exploit pretrained reasoning representations in models like Qwen, even with spurious rewards. Future research should validate RLVR on diverse model families to generalize the findings.

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

processors to address the increasing demands across diverse applications.
However, the rapid expansion of chip production has significantly increased
carbon emissions, raising critical concerns about environmental sustainability.
While researchers have previously modeled the carbon footprint (CFP) at both
system and processor levels, a holistic analysis of sustainability trends
encompassing the entire chip lifecycle remains lacking. This paper presents
CarbonSet, a comprehensive dataset integrating sustainability and performance
metrics for CPUs and GPUs over the past decade. CarbonSet aims to benchmark and
assess the design of next-generation processors. Leveraging this dataset, we
conducted detailed analysis of flagship processors' sustainability trends over
the last decade. This paper further highlights that modern processors are not
yet sustainably designed, with total carbon emissions increasing more than
50$\times$ in the past three years due to the surging demand driven by the AI
boom. Power efficiency remains a significant concern, while advanced process
nodes pose new challenges requiring to effectively amortize the dramatically
increased manufacturing carbon emissions.

### [29] [EasyDRAM: An FPGA-based Infrastructure for Fast and Accurate End-to-End Evaluation of Emerging DRAM Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10441)
*Oğuzhan Canpolat,Ataberk Olgun,David Novo,Oğuz Ergin,Onur Mutlu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: EasyDRAM introduces an FPGA-based framework for evaluating DRAM techniques, using a high-level language and novel time scaling to overcome existing platform limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in evaluating DRAM techniques, particularly accessibility issues due to the need for hardware description languages and the difficulty in replicating modern system dynamics.

Method: The approach involves using a programmable memory controller, enabling C++ implementation, and incorporating a time scaling technique to model processor-DRAM timing accurately.

Result: EasyDRAM successfully removes barriers to DRAM technique evaluation by simplifying the implementation process and achieving accurate system modeling.

Conclusion: EasyDRAM is expected to accelerate innovation in memory system design, and its open-source availability enables broader adoption and research progress.

Abstract: DRAM is a critical component of modern computing systems. Recent works
propose numerous techniques (that we call DRAM techniques) to enhance
DRAM-based computing systems' throughput, reliability, and computing
capabilities (e.g., in-DRAM bulk data copy). Evaluating the system-wide
benefits of DRAM techniques is challenging as they often require modifications
across multiple layers of the computing stack. Prior works propose FPGA-based
platforms for rapid end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM
chips. Unfortunately, existing platforms fall short in two major aspects: (1)
they require deep expertise in hardware description languages, limiting
accessibility; and (2) they are not designed to accurately model modern
computing systems.
  We introduce EasyDRAM, an FPGA-based framework for rapid and accurate
end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. EasyDRAM overcomes
the main drawbacks of prior FPGA-based platforms with two key ideas. First,
EasyDRAM removes the need for hardware description language expertise by
enabling developers to implement DRAM techniques using a high-level language
(C++). At runtime, EasyDRAM executes the software-defined memory system design
in a programmable memory controller. Second, EasyDRAM tackles a fundamental
challenge in accurately modeling modern systems: real processors typically
operate at higher clock frequencies than DRAM, a disparity that is difficult to
replicate on FPGA platforms. EasyDRAM addresses this challenge by decoupling
the processor-DRAM interface and advancing the system state using a novel
technique we call time scaling, which faithfully captures the timing behavior
of the modeled system.
  We believe and hope that EasyDRAM will enable innovative ideas in memory
system design to rapidly come to fruition. To aid future research EasyDRAM
implementation is open sourced at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/EasyDRAM.

*Luca Colagrande,Lorenzo Leone,Maximilian Coco,Andrei Deaconeasa,Luca Benini*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a low-overhead microarchitecture for machine learning accelerators, achieving higher utilization, improved performance, and energy efficiency over state-of-the-art solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for efficient yet flexible ML accelerators necessitates improvements in computational performance and energy efficiency without sacrificing programmability.

Method: A RISC-V based accelerator cluster is enhanced via 'zero-overhead loop nests' for control optimization and a 'zero-conflict memory subsystem' addressing bank conflicts, leveraging novel double-buffering-aware interconnects.

Result: 97%-99% utilization is achieved, along with 11% performance improvement and 8% energy efficiency gains over SoA RISC-V clusters while nearing specialized solutions in metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed design provides significant performance and efficiency improvements while remaining flexible and programmable, supporting broader workloads compared to specialized accelerators.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of machine learning (ML) workloads have
driven the design of ML accelerators aiming at an optimal tradeoff between
efficiency and flexibility. A widely explored architecture for flexible ML
accelerators is based on clusters of lightweight instruction processors sharing
multi-banked L1 memory, augmented with specialized instruction extensions for
key ML-related computations, such as matrix multiplication (matmul). However,
instruction extensions should be coupled with microarchitectural optimizations
that remove inefficiencies due to control flow (loop handling) and memory
access, without drastically increasing processor complexity. Moving from a
state-of-the-art (SoA) ML accelerator cluster based on RISC-V processors, we
propose a low-overhead optimized microarchitecture that eliminates these
inefficiencies almost entirely while retaining programmability. We introduce
"zero-overhead loop nests" to remove control overheads, and a "zero-conflict
memory subsystem", leveraging a novel double-buffering-aware interconnect, to
eliminate bank conflicts in L1 memory. With these enhancements, we attain
near-ideal utilizations between 96.1% and 99.4%, achieving 11% performance and
8% energy efficiency improvements over the baseline SoA RISC-V cluster. We
demonstrate comparable utilizations and performance to a specialized SoA
accelerator, with only 12% difference in energy efficiency, while providing a
fully-programmable general-purpose solution supporting a significantly wider
range of workloads.

*Melina Soysal,Konstantina Koliogeorgi,Can Firtina,Nika Mansouri Ghiasi,Rakesh Nadig,Haiyu Mayo,Geraldo F. Oliveira,Yu Liang,Klea Zambaku,Mohammad Sadrosadati,Onur Mutlu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes MARS, a storage-centric system to significantly improve the performance and energy efficiency of raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) by minimizing I/O data movement and leveraging in-storage computational capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the increasing gap between sequencing throughput and the ability of software-based RSGA to handle raw signal analysis, primarily because computation has shifted from being the bottleneck to I/O data movement and energy consumption.

Method: MARS adopts a hardware/software co-design to enable in-storage computation. It introduces two filtering mechanisms, a quantization scheme, Processing-Near-Memory, and Processing-Using-Memory techniques. It also orchestrates tasks to optimize parallelism and reduce data movement.

Result: MARS shows a 93x and 40x performance improvement over software and hardware-accelerated pipelines, respectively. It also achieves a 427x and 72x reduction in energy consumption.

Conclusion: MARS effectively alleviates the data movement bottleneck and accelerates RSGA through a novel, energy-efficient, and high-performance storage-centric approach.

Abstract: Raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) has emerged as a promising approach to
enable real-time genome analysis by directly analyzing raw electrical signals.
However, rapid advancements in sequencing technologies make it increasingly
difficult for software-based RSGA to match the throughput of raw signal
generation. This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques
can significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the
performance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As
sequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to
both runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a
high-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the
data movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We
propose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous
resources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage
controller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both
data movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and
low-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software
co-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering
mechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing
for in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly
within the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and
Processing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of
all steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement.
Our evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and
hardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on
average across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by
427x and 72x.

TL;DR: This paper provides a systematic framework to organize automatic evaluation methods for generative content across text, images, and audio modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of evaluating the quality of generative AI outputs, which currently lacks a unified systematic framework across different modalities.

Method: The authors reviewed existing evaluation approaches for text, images, and audio generation and developed a unified taxonomy based on five fundamental paradigms.

Result: The paper identifies key paradigms in evaluation methods and demonstrates their application across text, image, and audio domains.

Conclusion: A unified framework for evaluating generative AI outputs is introduced, with a focus on cross-modal applicability and future research directions.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TaskCraft, a workflow to generate multi-step, tool-based tasks for NLP models that are scalable and verifiable, addressing gaps in existing instruction data and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of tool interaction in current instruction data and the scalability issues of agentic benchmarks that rely on costly human annotations.

Method: Developed an automated workflow (TaskCraft) that creates difficulty-scalable, multi-tool tasks by using depth-based and width-based extensions to generate hierarchical and complex challenges.

Result: Generated a synthetic dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks, demonstrated improvement in prompt optimization and enhanced supervised fine-tuning for agentic models.

Conclusion: TaskCraft provides a scalable solution for generating complex and verifiable tasks, supporting advancements in agent training and evaluation in NLP and AI.

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines semantic degeneracy in natural language and how the complexity of language poses interpretive challenges for both humans and AI, proposing Bayesian approaches to better address these challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates the inherent limitations in language interpretation due to semantic degeneracy, which becomes more complex as language expressions increase in intricacy, challenging the classical understanding of meanings being intrinsic to linguistic forms.

Method: The authors used Kolmogorov complexity theory and a semantic Bell inequality test with Large Language Models (LLMs) as computational cognitive systems to analyze ambiguous word pairs under various contexts, aiming to explore the contextuality of linguistic meaning.

Result: Results show average CHSH expectation values between 1.2 to 2.8, with some significantly violating the classical limit (|S| ≤ 2). This highlights non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation, aligning with observations from human cognition.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that classical methods for analyzing natural language are lossy, and Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches are better suited for practical and context-appropriate characterizations of language meaning.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models behave under semantically identical but differently worded prompts, introducing a framework called PBSS to measure shifts in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine behavioral instability in large language models due to subtle prompt variations, which impact their evaluation and reliability.

Method: Introduced PBSS framework to measure behavioral shifts in LLMs, testing it across ten constrained tasks with semantically equivalent prompt rewordings.

Result: Found consistent model-specific response changes, linked to tokenization and decoding strategies.

Conclusion: Tokenization and decoding processes influence post-training response stability, highlighting the need for better evaluation mechanisms for LLMs.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartReasoner, a two-stage framework for improving visual reasoning on charts, achieving high interpretability and state-of-the-art performance using fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of extending large language models' reasoning capabilities to visual reasoning tasks, particularly in preserving critical structural and semantic information of visuals, such as charts.

Method: ChartReasoner involves a two-stage process: (1) training a model to convert chart images into high-fidelity structured ECharts codes, preserving layout and semantics, and (2) creating a chart reasoning data synthesis pipeline to generate and validate accurate reasoning trajectories. The final model is trained using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that ChartReasoner effectively preserves chart details and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art open-source models with fewer parameters. It closely approaches proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: ChartReasoner represents a significant advancement in multimodal visual reasoning, offering precise, interpretable reasoning over charts with a resource-efficient approach. Its results highlight the feasibility of achieving state-of-the-art performance without reliance on proprietary systems.

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), an unsupervised algorithm to fine-tune pretrained language models using their own generated labels, achieving competitive or superior performance compared to human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of training superhuman language models, where traditional human supervision is either difficult or inadequate.

Method: The authors propose a method called Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), which fine-tunes language models unsupervisedly by optimizing coherence in their self-generated outputs.

Result: ICM performs comparably to or better than human-supervised methods on GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward tasks, and excels in leveraging superhuman model capabilities. It also improves the development of reward models and assistants such as Claude 3.5 Haiku-based systems.

Conclusion: ICM demonstrates the potential of unsupervised fine-tuning, outperforming traditional supervised methods in cases where language models surpass human-level capabilities.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

TL;DR: This study evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) judge empathic communication compared to human experts and crowdworkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how reliably LLMs can assess empathic communication across psychological and linguistic frameworks is essential for building emotionally sensitive conversational systems.

Method: The researchers analyzed empathic communication annotations on 200 real-world conversations, comparing expert (3,150), crowdworker (2,844), and LLM (3,150) annotations across four evaluative frameworks.

Result: The agreement among experts was high but varied; LLMs performed close to expert-level benchmarks and surpassed crowdworker reliability in all frameworks.

Conclusion: LLMs, when validated against proper benchmarks, can effectively support emotionally sensitive tasks, fostering accountability in their deployment as conversational aids.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

Result: The paper evaluates various techniques for efficient emotion analysis in Bangla using computational models.

Conclusion: This study advances tools and methodologies for sentiment analysis in resource-limited languages, providing insights on model performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and

22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human capital is increasingly central to corporate value creation, but lacks clear standards for measurement and disclosure.

Method: The paper employs machine learning (word2vec) to create a lexicon of HC-related keywords, classified into five categories, and provides associated tools like Python code and examples for further research.

Result: The lexicon identifies keywords across five HC management dimensions (DEI, health and safety, labor relations, compensation, and demographics) and demonstrates its utility for fine-tuning models like BERT.

Conclusion: The research aids in advancing HC study by offering versatile tools and data, and encourages further exploration in HC management and disclosure practices.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the story generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using a benchmark focused on narrative planning based on literature examples, investigating qualities like causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the abilities of LLMs in generating high-quality stories, given the limitations of current evaluation methods and the insights from computational narratology.

Method: The study benchmarks LLMs on narrative planning, using literature examples to evaluate their performance on causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict.

Result: Experiments reveal that GPT-4 level LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales, but face difficulties with character intentionality and dramatic conflict, especially without integrating reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The research provides insights on the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in story generation, including their potential and challenges in narrative planning for applications in areas like gaming.

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

Motivation: Improve identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events using latent parametric knowledge.

Method: Present a Query-to-Event decomposition approach leveraging knowledge in LLMs and VLMs, adaptable across modalities, and fuse multimodal data using entropy-based fusion scoring.

Result: Q2E outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for text-to-video retrieval and shows the benefit of incorporating audio inputs.

Conclusion: The Q2E approach enhances retrieval performance across diverse datasets and domains, proving adaptability and effectiveness of decomposing queries to better extract knowledge from LLMs and VLMs.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

### [44] [TTT-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Reasoning Ability with Simple and Novel Tic-Tac-Toe-style Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10209)
*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents TTT-Bench, a benchmark to test LRMs using simple Tic-Tac-Toe-style games. Findings show that while LRMs excel in mathematical reasoning, they struggle with basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning models excel at challenging STEM tasks but their ability to reason in non-STEM domains, such as strategic and spatial reasoning, lacks comprehensive evaluation.

Method: The authors designed TTT-Bench consisting of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games, using a scalable programmatic approach to generate game problems requiring strategic and spatial reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art reasoning models, despite excelling in hard math benchmarks, perform poorly on TTT-Bench, scoring significantly lower on strategic reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: TTT-Bench highlights a limitation in existing reasoning models, showcasing the need for improvement in strategic and spatial reasoning tasks even with larger model sizes.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

*Anneliese Brei,Katharine Henry,Abhisheik Sharma,Shashank Srivastava,Snigdha Chaturvedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TUNa, a dataset and methodology for detecting unreliable narrators across various textual domains using computational methods and language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to identify narrators who unintentionally provide misrepresented information, leveraging computational and literary approaches.

Method: The authors create a human-annotated dataset (TUNa) from diverse sources like blog posts and literature, define classification tasks for different unreliability types, and evaluate LLMs through few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning techniques.

Result: The results demonstrate that detecting unreliable narrators is challenging, but LLMs show promise in addressing this task.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of LLMs for unreliable narrator detection, releases a new benchmark dataset, and sets the stage for future research.

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces ToxSyn-PT, a new Portuguese dataset for fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine minority groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Portuguese hate-speech datasets are limited in size, group representation, and focus on social-media content.

Method: A novel four-stage pipeline is used: manually curated seed, few-shot expansion with large language models, paraphrase augmentation, and enrichment with neutral texts.

Result: Generated a class-balanced, stylistically diverse dataset that generalizes well across five Portuguese hate-speech datasets, even across domain boundaries.

Conclusion: The publicly released ToxSyn-PT dataset is a breakthrough in simplifying hate-speech detection in Portuguese for low-resource settings and synthetic dataset research.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

### [47] [Do Language Models Have Bayesian Brains? Distinguishing Stochastic and Deterministic Decision Patterns within Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10268)
*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper revisits the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions via Gibbs sampling, proving they can exhibit deterministic behavior under some conditions, even when sampling. It proposes a method to distinguish stochastic and deterministic behaviors in such scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to critically examine whether language models truly make probabilistic decisions, as traditionally assumed, and to address flaws in previous methods that infer human-like priors.

Method: The paper studies the decision-making behavior of language models, proposing a method to differentiate stochastic and deterministic decision patterns during simulated Gibbs sampling.

Result: The findings reveal that language models can display deterministic behaviors, challenging probabilistic assumptions. Moreover, simulated Gibbs sampling may result in inferring false priors from deterministic systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that careful scrutiny is essential in analyzing language model priors, and the proposed method helps distinguish genuine probabilistic behavior from determinism to prevent misleading inferences.

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

### [48] [ClusterUCB: Efficient Gradient-Based Data Selection for Targeted Fine-Tuning of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10288)
*Zige Wang,Qi Zhu,Fei Mi,Minghui Xu,Ruochun Jin,Wenjing Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new, efficient framework called ClusterUCB is introduced for gradient-based data selection in large language models, using clustering and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based data selection is resource-intensive due to the need for computing gradients throughout fine-tuning, making it impractical for large language models.

Method: The proposed framework, ClusterUCB, clusters data samples based on gradient similarity, then uses a modified UCB algorithm to allocate computing budgets efficiently by solving a multi-armed bandit problem.

Result: ClusterUCB achieves results comparable to traditional gradient-based methods while significantly reducing computational cost across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: ClusterUCB demonstrates that clustering and efficient exploration-exploitation balance can make gradient-based data selection practical and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

### [49] [Flick: Few Labels Text Classification using K-Aware Intermediate Learning in Multi-Task Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292)
*Ali Almutairi,Abdullah Alsuhaibani,Shoaib Jameel,Usman Naseem,Gelareh Mohammadi,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flick, a system for semi-supervised text classification tailored for low-resource linguistic contexts, featuring improved pseudo-label refinement to reduce errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges in semi-supervised text classification for low-resource languages, such as noisy pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, while avoiding reliance on cascading models or resource-rich setups.

Method: Flick refines pseudo-labels by identifying top-performing clusters using single-cluster cohesion and an adaptive top-k selection mechanism, enabling robust model training with very few labeled examples.

Result: Flick demonstrates superior performance across 14 datasets, including low-resource languages like Arabic and Setswana, as well as English.

Conclusion: Flick effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for few-label classification in low-resource linguistic settings.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

### [50] ["Check My Work?": Measuring Sycophancy in a Simulated Educational Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10297)
*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates how user suggestions influence the behavior and correctness of LLMs, highlighting a "sycophancy" bias where models are swayed by user mentions of correct or incorrect answers, with significant implications for education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the risks posed by LLM sycophancy in educational contexts, where models may inadvertently reinforce incorrect knowledge for learners.

Method: The authors tested five LLMs from OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 families under five experimental conditions, assessing response quality and analyzing biases based on user input framing.

Result: Correctness dropped by up to 15% when students mentioned incorrect answers, and improved by the same margin with correct mentions. This effect was more pronounced in smaller models, such as GPT-4.1-nano, compared to larger ones like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit sycophancy, adjusting answers based on user input, which may deepen educational inequalities. The study underscores the necessity of understanding and mitigating these biases in LLM deployment for learning purposes.

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

*Hayato Futami,Emiru Tsunoo,Yosuke Kashiwagi,Yuki Ito,Hassan Shahmohammadi,Siddhant Arora,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses modality adaptation in speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) using LLMs by introducing interleaved speech-text training with decreasing text ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are typically trained on text-only data, presenting challenges for adapting them to the speech modality due to limited speech-to-speech data.

Method: Scheduled interleaved speech–text training, where speech and text units are combined at the word level, and the text ratio is progressively decreased during training.

Result: Experimental evaluations on the CVSS dataset show performance improvements in translation, particularly for languages with sparse training data.

Conclusion: The proposed interleaved training method aids in overcoming the modality adaptation challenge, making LLMs better suited for S2ST tasks, especially when data is scarce.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

*Dongwon Jung,Wenxuan Zhou,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable method leveraging program execution to generate high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets for training large language models (LLMs), surpassing existing methods reliant on human annotations or error-prone LLM output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating reliable reasoning supervision for improving LLM reasoning abilities is expensive and error-prone with current approaches, indicating a need for more scalable and accurate methods.

Method: The authors extract step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution, verify them, and transform these traces into natural language CoT reasoning datasets.

Result: The proposed method enhances LLMs' transferable reasoning abilities across different tasks, demonstrates lower token usage due to reduced repetition and overthinking, and produces highly accurate reasoning data.

Conclusion: Leveraging program determinism offers an efficient and reliable approach to improving reasoning capabilities in LLMs, reducing the need for costly or inaccurate alternative data generation techniques.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

*Xiaohan Yu,Pu Jian,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TableRAG, a novel framework improving question answering on heterogeneous documents by addressing issues with current retrieval-augmented generation approaches. It outperforms baselines and is available for public use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation methods struggle with heterogeneous data sources, especially tabular data, due to information loss and weakened reasoning capabilities.

Method: The TableRAG framework operates in iterative steps: query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL execution, and intermediate answer generation. It combines textual analysis and tabular data manipulation.

Result: TableRAG consistently outperformed existing baselines on public datasets and the newly developed HeteQA benchmark, showcasing superior reasoning over heterogeneous documents.

Conclusion: TableRAG pushes the boundaries of heterogeneous document question answering by integrating advanced reasoning techniques, setting a new standard for this domain.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

*Yuhua Jiang,Yuwen Xiong,Yufeng Yuan,Chao Xin,Wenyuan Xu,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAG, a framework enabling LLMs to self-verify and self-correct within a unified reinforcement learning setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inability of LLMs to reliably verify the correctness of their outputs without requiring complex or separate verification methods.

Method: Introduce the PAG framework, which lets LLMs alternate between policy and verification roles, utilizing a selective revision mechanism for error correction in a reinforcement learning paradigm.

Result: Experiments show PAG improves reasoning and verification skills, enhancing both generation quality and self-correction accuracy across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The PAG framework effectively boosts LLM reasoning and verification performance, presenting a scalable approach to overcoming inherent model collapse issues.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark named TempVS to test Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on temporal reasoning and grounding in image sequences, revealing a significant gap between MLLMs and human capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of an effective benchmark for evaluating the temporal reasoning and grounding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Method: The authors developed a benchmark named TempVS, consisting of three main tests (event relation inference, sentence ordering, and image ordering) along with a basic grounding test, and evaluated 38 state-of-the-art MLLMs against it.

Result: The evaluation revealed that current MLLMs struggle significantly on the TempVS benchmark, displaying a performance gap relative to human capabilities and providing insights into areas for improvement.

Conclusion: TempVS is an effective tool to identify key challenges in MLLMs' temporal reasoning and grounding, offering valuable data for advancing future research in this area.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines news framing in the Israel-Palestine war and highlights biases, finding a focus on war journalism and differences in international reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how news framing in times of conflict influences public opinion and potentially exacerbates conflicts, addressing limitations in superficial past studies.

Method: They utilize computational approaches combining frame semantics and large language models to analyze war and peace journalism indicators in news articles.

Result: The study finds predominant war-oriented reporting and identifies differences in framing biases across US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets regarding assailants and victims.

Conclusion: Media framing during war heavily favors war journalism over peace journalism, with evident regional biases, underscoring the need for awareness in news consumers and balanced reporting.

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

*Zehui Ling,Deshu Chen,Hongwei Zhang,Yifeng Jiao,Xin Guo,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to enhance LLM reasoning efficiency by balancing conciseness and accuracy based on problem complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of LLM reasoning by making outputs concise for simpler tasks while maintaining accuracy for complex ones.

Method: The study uses a reward function with a novel penalty mechanism for output length to manage reasoning efficiency.

Result: Performance improvement observed on GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024 datasets, with shortened outputs and better accuracy on simpler tasks, and increased accuracy for complex ones.

Conclusion: The novel method successfully enhances reasoning efficiency in LLMs while considering problem complexity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

*Xanh Ho,Sunisth Kumar,Yun-Ang Wu,Florian Boudin,Atsuhiro Takasu,Akiko Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reframes the task of scientific claim verification against tables as an explanation task, requiring models to identify essential table cells. It introduces a new dataset with human-annotated rationales and demonstrates benefits of table alignment information for performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance interpretability in scientific claim verification by addressing the insufficiency of traditional label-prediction approaches that lack insight into model reasoning.

Method: Researchers annotated rationales by verifying claim labels and highlighting minimal necessary table cells, then used this data to propose a taxonomy for ambiguous cases, experimenting with models and alignment information.

Result: The study finds that incorporating table alignment enhances performance and LLMs often predict correct labels but fail to align with human-annotated rationales, revealing limited faithful reasoning.

Conclusion: Using human-aligned rationales improves interpretability and claim verification but highlights LLMs' shortcomings in reasoning alignment. The dataset enriches reasoning evaluation and model development.

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

*Shangshang Wang,Julian Asilis,Ömer Faruk Akgül,Enes Burak Bilgin,Ollie Liu,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tina, a family of cost-efficient reasoning models, using minimal resources and reinforcement learning with LoRA, achieving significant results at a reduced cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish how strong reasoning abilities can be developed in language models using minimal computational resources and cost.

Method: The study leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) during reinforcement learning to update a small 1.5B parameter base model, achieving efficient reasoning without requiring extensive computational resources.

Result: Tina models demonstrate competitive or better reasoning performance compared to SOTA models, achieving substantial cost and resource savings (e.g., $9 USD post-training and 260x cost reduction).

Conclusion: LoRA's parameter-efficient updates offer a surprisingly effective path to develop reasoning in language models, enabling cost-efficiency while maintaining robust performance on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

*Aleksandra Sorokovikova,Pavel Chizhov,Iuliia Eremenko,Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores biases in large language models (LLMs) and finds evidence of bias based on task type and user interaction, particularly in scenarios like salary negotiations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and identify bias in large language models due to their exposure to controversial and stereotypical content during training, which can lead to unequal behavior depending on persona or user context.

Method: The analysis employs various proxy measures of bias, including evaluating LLMs through pre-prompted personae on a benchmark (MMLU), reformulating tasks to assess user-graded answers, and examining contextual use cases such as salary negotiation to identify biases.

Result: Findings indicate that pre-prompted persona evaluation on an MMLU benchmark shows minor, random differences. However, user-graded task reformulations and scenarios like salary negotiations reveal more significant and noticeable bias.

Conclusion: The study highlights the presence of bias in LLMs, particularly in tasks involving user interaction and personalization, and it emphasizes concerns about these biases given the trend towards personalized AI chatbot assistants.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

### [61] [Resa: Transparent Reasoning Models via SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09967)
*Shangshang Wang,Julian Asilis,Ömer Faruk Akgül,Enes Burak Bilgin,Ollie Liu,Deqing Fu,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Resa, a reasoning model, developed using Sparse Autoencoder Tuning (SAE-Tuning) to cost-effectively extract and enhance reasoning abilities in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a cost-efficient approach to elicit strong reasoning capabilities in language models using question-answer data without reasoning traces.

Method: The method involves Sparse Autoencoder Tuning (SAE-Tuning), which trains an autoencoder to capture reasoning abilities from source models and guides fine-tuning of target models using verified question-answer data.

Result: SAE-Tuning achieves over 97% of RL-trained performance, cuts costs by >2000x to $1, and reduces training time by >450x to 20 minutes. It also demonstrates generalization to new datasets and modularity across different models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SAE-Tuning is an efficient, generalizable, and modular approach for extracting reasoning abilities in language models, with significant reductions in cost and time and capabilities to transfer across datasets and models.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

*Sangmin Song,Juhwan Choi,JungMin Yun,YoungBin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs in multi-user dialogue state tracking (DST), showing reduced performance compared to single-user scenarios and proposing methods for robust evaluation using extended datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DST benchmarks focus on structured single-user conversations, yet real-world scenarios often involve multi-user interactions with added complexity.

Method: They extend an existing DST dataset by adding second-user utterances based on speech act theory, enabling controlled evaluations of LLMs in multi-user dialogues.

Result: Experimental results show significant performance drops for LLMs in multi-user DST scenarios, revealing their limitations in complex conversations.

Conclusion: Future research must focus on improving LLM capabilities for multi-user DST to simulate real-world interactions more effectively and create robust models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

### [63] [Reliable Reasoning Path: Distilling Effective Guidance for LLM Reasoning with Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10508)
*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Bo Li,Qing Li,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the RRP framework for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs) through enhanced utilization of knowledge graphs (KGs), which refine relationships and construct coherent reasoning paths, resulting in state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail in knowledge-intensive tasks due to limited factual knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions integrating KGs have shown limited success in handling complex questions due to difficulties in extracting and refining reasoning paths.

Method: The proposed RRP framework leverages the semantic capabilities of LLMs alongside relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning to extract coherent reasoning paths. It incorporates a rethinking module to assess and improve the relevance of the retrieved paths.

Result: Experimental evaluations on two public datasets demonstrate that RRP outperforms existing baseline methods and enhances reasoning abilities of LLMs. It is also adaptable, allowing easy integration with various LLMs.

Conclusion: RRP effectively improves LLM reasoning by forming high-quality, question-specific reasoning paths from KGs. Through its plug-and-play integration, it enhances the practical application of LLMs in complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

*Promise Dodzi Kpoglu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid unsupervised method to reconstruct ancestral word forms (protoforms) by combining data-driven inference and rule-based heuristics, showing improved accuracy and phonological plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing protoforms rely heavily on probabilistic, data-driven models, which lack linguistic constraints and may be limited in their effectiveness.

Method: The paper presents a hybrid model that integrates statistical inference with linguistically motivated rule-based heuristics, using an evolutionary optimization framework.

Result: Experimentation with cognate sets from Romance languages demonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and phonological plausibility compared to traditional baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach highlights the benefits of combining statistical and rule-based methods for protoform reconstruction, promising more accurate and linguistically sound results.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper designs methods to assess AI-powered tutors' ability to identify mistakes in students' mathematical reasoning, employing machine learning and prompting techniques, with the best-performing system employing example-driven LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate AI-powered tutors' pedagogical capabilities by assessing their ability to identify reasoning mistakes in students’ mathematical explanations.

Method: Four methods were explored: (1) an ensemble of machine learning models over token embeddings, (2) frozen sentence-transformer with MLP classifier, (3) history-aware multi-head attention model, and (4) retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting with LLM (GPT-4). A final system combined example retrieval, structured prompts, and schema-guided parsing.

Result: The proposed retrieval-augmented LLM prompting system surpassed all baseline models, demonstrating strong performance in mistake identification and interpretable prediction.

Conclusion: Combining retrieval-augmented example-driven prompting with large language models enhances the ability to assess pedagogical feedback accurately and interpretably.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) encode and handle character-level information during token spelling and reveals inefficiencies in the process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs internally represent and process character-level information for tasks such as spelling out tokens, which are simple for humans but challenging for LLMs.

Method: The study uses probing classifiers, identifies knowledge neurons, and inspects attention weights to analyze how LLMs encode and process character-level information across different layers.

Result: The embedding layer of LLMs lacks robust encoding of character-level information beyond the initial character, requiring higher Transformer layers to reconstruct this information, with a distinct breakthrough in spelling behavior observed in those layers.

Conclusion: LLMs do not encode character-level information straightforwardly, relying instead on complex internal mechanisms in higher layers to perform spelling tasks effectively.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on using large language models (LLMs) to detect life-threatening language, outperforming traditional methods in various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the detection of life-threatening language for the protection of individuals in distress and to improve mental health interventions.

Method: The researchers fine-tuned three open-source LLMs—Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2—using datasets of varying class balance levels, and compared their performance with traditional methods.

Result: LLMs, particularly Mistral and Llama-2, demonstrated superior performance across balanced and imbalanced datasets, with limited additional benefit from upsampling in LLMs compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: LLMs show substantial potential for real-world applications in detecting life-threatening language, outperforming traditional approaches even under challenging data conditions.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to predict adjective hypernymy in the context of the Open English Wordnet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Open English Wordnet lacks many hypernymy links, particularly for adjectives, which affects its comprehensiveness as a linguistic resource.

Method: The authors present a theoretical discussion of adjective hypernymy and use fine-tuned large language models, adapting the TaxoLLaMa methodology, to predict such relations.

Result: They successfully develop a resource for adjective hypernymy and demonstrate that large language models can be effectively fine-tuned for this task.

Conclusion: The methodology presented offers a promising approach to enhance the Open English Wordnet's completeness by addressing gaps in adjective hypernymy.

Abstract: Open English Wordnet is a key resource published in OntoLex-lemon as part of
the linguistic linked open data cloud. There are, however, many links missing
in the resource, and in this paper, we look at how we can establish hypernymy
between adjectives. We present a theoretical discussion of the hypernymy
relation and how it differs for adjectives in contrast to nouns and verbs. We
develop a new resource for adjective hypernymy and fine-tune large language
models to predict adjective hypernymy, showing that the methodology of
TaxoLLaMa can be adapted to this task.

*Ye Yu,Yaoning Yu,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PREMISE, a framework for optimizing mathematical reasoning tasks in large reasoning models (LRMs) to reduce verbosity, inference tokens, and costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of lengthy chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LRMs, which increases token usage, cost, and hinders deployment in environments with latency or API constraints.

Method: PREMISE is a prompt-only framework that uses trace-level diagnostics and gradient-inspired prompt optimization to reduce computation overhead and verbosity, enabling brevity and correctness through multi-objective textual search.

Result: PREMISE matched or improved baseline accuracy on GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 benchmarks while cutting reasoning tokens by up to 87.5% and reducing deployment costs by 69%–82%.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that PREMISE is a scalable and practical solution to enhance efficiency in LRM inference without compromising the quality of reasoning or answers.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ClaimSpect, a framework for dissecting and analyzing nuanced claims into hierarchical aspects using retrieval-augmented generation. This approach provides structured responses and multiple perspectives from a corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the complexity of nuanced claims (particularly scientific and political) by breaking them into their integral aspects and sub-aspects, making such claims easier to validate and analyze from multiple perspectives.

Method: The paper proposes ClaimSpect, a framework that uses retrieval-augmented generation to create a hierarchy of claim aspects. It partitions an input corpus hierarchically to retrieve relevant data segments, discover sub-aspects, and identify varying perspectives with their prevalence on different aspects.

Result: The framework was tested on real-world scientific and political claims using a specially constructed dataset. It demonstrated robustness and accuracy in breaking down nuanced claims and effectively representing varying perspectives in both case studies and human evaluations.

Conclusion: ClaimSpect is a useful tool for deconstructing and analyzing complex claims, providing structured, multi-perspective responses that outperformed multiple baselines in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

TL;DR: TaxoAdapt is a framework for dynamic taxonomy adaptation using large language models, addressing the evolving and multi-dimensional nature of scientific literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizing and retrieving scientific literature has become increasingly challenging due to the rapid evolution of scientific domains and the limitations of current taxonomy methods.

Method: TaxoAdapt dynamically adapts taxonomy using an iterative hierarchical classification approach utilizing LLM-generated insights. It expands taxonomy depth and width based on corpus topical distribution.

Result: TaxoAdapt outperforms competitive baselines, generating taxonomies that are 26.51% more granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent, particularly for computer science literature.

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt addresses gaps in automatic taxonomy methods by dynamically adapting to evolving scientific literature, showcasing state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how to enhance multilingual LLMs' adaptability to new languages post-training by using a universal tokenizer, showing improved language coverage and plasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in training multilingual LLMs, such as model capacity, data scarcity, and tokenization for new languages.

Method: Proposing and testing a universal tokenizer that includes additional languages at the pretraining stage and systematically evaluating it.

Result: The universal tokenizer improves language adaptation, achieving up to 20.2% higher win rates for pretraining languages and up to 5% gain for entirely new languages.

Conclusion: A universal tokenizer is beneficial for expanding language coverage, enhancing post-training adaptability with minimal trade-offs in performance for pretraining languages.

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) estimate uncertainties in clinical multiple-choice question answering, comparing various methods and models while analyzing specialties and question types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure reliable applications of LLMs in critical domains like clinical decision support by improving the accuracy of uncertainty estimation methods.

Method: Examines uncertainty estimation methods using ten open-source LLMs across multiple datasets, specialties, and question types, including single-generation and sampling-based approaches, plus single-pass estimators derived from behavioral signals.

Result: Lightweight single-pass estimators came close to matching the performance of Semantic Entropy models while being computationally efficient. Results highlighted considerable variation in performance depending on the medical specialty and question type.

Conclusion: Model selection should consider both the specific question type and the strength of the model. Simple estimators can provide reliable uncertainty estimates with lower computational complexity.

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

*Viet Anh Trinh,Xinlu He,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve recognition of named entities in ASR systems using a large language model (LLM) and achieves significant reductions in word error rate (WER) for named entities on a specialized dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with high word error rates (WERs) for named entities, which are often critical keywords affecting downstream applications.

Method: The authors introduce a revision mechanism leveraging a large language model (LLM) for correcting named entities by utilizing context, like lecture notes, which include correct named entities.

Result: On the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, their approach leads to a relative reduction of up to 30% in the WER for named entities.

Conclusion: Incorporating LLM's reasoning abilities and context effectively improves ASR reliability for handling named entities, which is vital for applications requiring accurate domain-specific recognition.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

*Wei Sun,Tingyu Qu,Mingxiao Li,Jesse Davis,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangEdit offers a breakthrough solution for updating multilingual knowledge in LLMs by ensuring independence between edits without degrading their generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient multilingual knowledge editing in LLMs without destructive parameter interference remains a challenge, given the impracticality of managing separate models for each language.

Method: LangEdit uses a null-space constrained framework that isolates language-specific updates by projecting parameter changes into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring update independence.

Result: LangEdit was evaluated on three models, six languages, and four tasks, with results showing reduced parameter interference and superior performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: LangEdit proves to be an efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge editing solution that preserves generalization while facilitating seamless updates, highlighting its practicality for real-world LLM applications.

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

*Zhensheng Jin,Xinze Li,Yifan Ji,Chunyi Peng,Zhenghao Liu,Qi Shi,Yukun Yan,Shuo Wang,Furong Peng,Ge Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReCUT methodology addresses the issue of overthinking in LLM reasoning tasks by compressing reasoning paths while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompting excel in reasoning but often generate overly long and redundant traces, needing a mechanism to balance length and accuracy.

Method: ReCUT introduces stepwise exploration and long-short switched sampling, leveraging reasoning paths to train Gemini LLMs separately for accuracy and brevity, later combining them for final results.

Result: Experimental findings showed ReCUT achieved 30-50% reduction in reasoning lengths while maintaining or enhancing accuracy across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: ReCUT offers a novel framework for compressing reasoning lengths in LLMs without sacrificing accuracy, marking significant progress in efficient reasoning generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

*Qingyan Wei,Yaojie Zhang,Zhiyuan Liu,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SlowFast Sampling, a dynamic strategy for diffusion-based language models (dLLMs), enhancing speed and efficiency during token generation with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dLLM sampling strategies are static, causing inefficiencies and limited flexibility in token generation.

Method: The paper proposes SlowFast Sampling, guided by three principles (certainty, convergence, positional), and integrates it with dLLM-Cache to optimize dynamic token decoding.

Result: SlowFast Sampling achieves speedups of up to 15.63× without caching and 34.22× with caching, with competitive accuracy compared to autoregressive baselines.

Conclusion: Dynamic sampling strategies, like SlowFast Sampling, can significantly boost performance and efficiency in dLLMs, making them viable alternatives to autoregressive LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

*Michele Gubian,Ioana Krehan,Oli Liu,James Kirby,Sharon Goldwater*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how wav2vec2 models trained on different languages encode linguistic and speaker information, revealing largely language-independent representation structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how wav2vec2 models trained on various languages encode different types of information, such as phones, tones, and speaker attributes, and whether these representations depend on the language of pretraining.

Method: The study used probing classifiers and geometric analyses to investigate the representation of phones, lexical tones, and speaker information in wav2vec2 models trained on four different languages.

Result: The study found that representation subspaces for phones, tones, and speakers are largely orthogonal regardless of pretraining and test languages, with consistent layerwise probing patterns. A small advantage was seen for matched-language phone and tone probes in later layers.

Conclusion: wav2vec2 learns representation structures that are mostly independent of the specific speech material or language used during pretraining.

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical dialogue systems often fail at identifying relevant medical knowledge and generating personalized, medically accurate responses, which limits their efficacy in healthcare applications.

Method: The paper introduces MedRef, employing a knowledge refining mechanism to filter out irrelevant data and designing a prompt structure that incorporates both historical and evident details. It also incorporates two modules: Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, to adapt knowledge dynamically in real-time.

Result: Experiments on MedDG and KaMed benchmarks show superior performance of MedRef in terms of generation quality and medical entity accuracy compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: MedRef is effective and reliable for real-world healthcare applications, demonstrating significant advancements in medical dialogue systems with its dynamic, context-aware approach.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and QLoRA) on large language model performance across reasoning and knowledge tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies optimize LLMs for task-specific performance under computational resource constraints.

Method: Evaluation of LoRA and QLoRA fine-tuning strategies across commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and multi-domain knowledge benchmarks.

Result: LoRA methods improve task-specific performance efficiently and emphasize alignment between fine-tuning datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA enhance LLM adaptation while offering practical insights for resource-limited implementations.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large

QLoRA). We evaluate model capabilities across three key domains: (1)
commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), (2) mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and (3)
multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).
  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve

performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and

parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers
implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

### [83] [Generalization or Hallucination? Understanding Out-of-Context Reasoning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10887)
*Yixiao Huang,Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Jiantao Jiao,Somayeh Sojoudi,Michael I. Jordan,Stuart Russell,Song Mei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models' (LLMs) abilities to generalize and hallucinate originate from out-of-context reasoning (OCR), a cognitive mechanism that relates concepts without requiring causality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the duality in LLMs' abilities to generalize from new facts while also being prone to hallucinating incorrect information, and to understand the underlying reasons behind these phenomena.

Method: The study identifies OCR as a driving mechanism for generalization and hallucination, formalizes it through a synthetic factual recall task, and uses theoretical and empirical analyses to explore its functioning. Experiments were performed with LLMs and simplified attention-based transformer models.

Result: The empirical findings show that a single-layer, single-head attention-only transformer with factorized matrices can effectively solve OCR tasks, while models with combined weights cannot. Theoretical analysis attributes OCR capability to gradient descent's bias toward solutions with low nuclear norm values.

Conclusion: The research provides a theoretical framework for OCR, explaining LLMs' ability to generalize spurious and causal correlations, while contributing strategies to mitigate hallucinations in knowledge injection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioClinical ModernBERT, an advanced domain-adapted encoder tailored for biomedical and clinical NLP, outperforming existing models in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing encoder models for biomedical and clinical NLP have limitations in domain adaptation and rely on restricted datasets.

Method: The authors continued pretraining ModernBERT on a large biomedical-clinical corpus and incorporated diverse datasets spanning from various institutions and regions.

Result: BioClinical ModernBERT demonstrated superior performance in four downstream tasks and addressed limitations of prior clinical encoders.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers improved capability in processing biomedical text, enhancing speed and performance, with accessible checkpoints for further development.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

### [85] [Beyond Gold Standards: Epistemic Ensemble of LLM Judges for Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10903)
*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,Andre Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method using an ensemble of LLM judges to evaluate autoformalization in mathematics, focusing on nuanced and systematic criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating autoformalization in complex mathematical domains is challenging due to the need for significant human effort and expertise. Existing coarse-grained methods are insufficient for high-level tasks.

Method: The authors propose an ensemble of LLM judges (EFG) guided by criteria such as logical preservation, mathematical consistency, formal validity, and formal quality, creating a systematic and nuanced evaluation scheme.

Result: Experiments show that the EFG ensemble outperforms simple models and correlates more strongly with human assessments, particularly in evaluating formal qualities.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that a well-defined, nuanced framework of LLM-as-judges could provide scalable, reliable, and interpretable tools for assessing mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the boundaries of training large language models (LLMs) using pure reinforcement learning, avoiding dependency on pre-existing traces or implementations.

Method: The method involves developing a proprietary RL pipeline and training models solely on text data, including techniques to enforce reasoning language.

Result: Results show that RL on text alone maintains the model's initial checkpoint capabilities while enhancing multimodal understanding, instruction following, and function calling.

Conclusion: Magistral demonstrates the viability of pure RL training for reasoning models, offering improved capabilities through its framework and open-sourcing one of the models for community use.

Abstract: We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable
reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. Instead of relying on existing
implementations and RL traces distilled from prior models, we follow a ground
up approach, relying solely on our own models and infrastructure. Notably, we
demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal
understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral
Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we

*Or Shafran,Atticus Geiger,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to identify interpretable features in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing MLP activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to identify interpretable and causally relevant units of analysis in LLMs has motivated a shift from individual neurons to directions in activation space. Existing methods like sparse autoencoders face challenges in causal evaluation and interpretability.

Method: The authors employ semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to decompose MLP activations into sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons. These features are mapped to their activating inputs for interpretability and analyzed in an unsupervised manner.

Result: Experiments on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, and GPT-2 demonstrate that SNMF outperforms SAEs and supervised baselines in causal evaluations. The analysis shows that neuron combinations are reused across related features, revealing hierarchical structures in MLP activations.

Conclusion: SNMF is presented as a simple, effective, and interpretable tool for investigating the internal workings of LLMs and identifying meaningful concept representations.

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Motivation: Enhance human-AI collaboration by addressing belief-update resistance, termed "epistemic friction," which is often overlooked despite its significance in aligning AI with human preferences.

Method: The authors define dynamic epistemic friction within Dynamic Epistemic Logic, and use analyses of collaborative tasks to demonstrate its predictive utility for belief updates in dialogues.

Result: The proposed framework effectively predicts belief revision dynamics in dialogue interactions and highlights how epistemic friction can evolve to capture real-world complexities.

Conclusion: Dynamic epistemic friction provides a robust model to understand belief alignment challenges, with potential for refinement to better address real-world dialogue scenarios in human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

### [89] [Domain2Vec: Vectorizing Datasets to Find the Optimal Data Mixture without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10952)
*Mozhi Zhang,Howe Tissue,Lu Wang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Domain2Vec, a framework that decomposes datasets into meta-domains to optimize data usage for language model pretraining, achieving improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in language model pretraining by better aligning training and validation data distributions for optimal performance.

Method: Domain2Vec constructs domain vectors using a meta-domain vocabulary and classifier, enabling training-free data mixture optimization under the Distribution Alignment Assumption.

Result: The method reduces computational costs by 48.5% while maintaining validation loss, and improves downstream task performance by 2.83% under equivalent budgets.

Conclusion: Domain2Vec enhances efficiency and scalability in optimizing data mixtures for language model training, underscoring its practical utility in minimizing computational overhead.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

*Kangwei Liu,Siyuan Cheng,Bozhong Tian,Xiaozhuan Liang,Yuyang Yin,Meng Han,Ningyu Zhang,Bryan Hooi,Xi Chen,Shumin Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark and rule base for detecting harmful content in Chinese using large language models and proposes a knowledge-augmented baseline model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing resources for detecting harmful content are mostly focused on English, leaving a gap in Chinese datasets, which are limited and often scoped narrowly.

Method: The authors created a comprehensive benchmark using real-world data, annotated it professionally across six harm categories, developed a knowledge rule base, and designed a knowledge-augmented baseline model combining expert rules and LLM knowledge.

Result: The knowledge-augmented baseline model enables smaller models to perform at a level comparable to state-of-the-art large language models in harmful content detection.

Conclusion: This work offers a valuable resource for Chinese harmful content detection and illustrates the power of combining explicit expert rules with LLM knowledge to enhance model efficiency and accessibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

*Yixin Ou,Yujie Luo,Jingsheng Zheng,Lanning Wei,Shuofei Qiao,Jintian Zhang,Da Zheng,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMind is a framework for LLM agents that advances automated data science through adaptive strategies and expert grounding, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents lack flexibility and expertise in addressing complex data science tasks beyond predefined workflows and simple problems.

Method: AutoMind integrates a curated expert knowledge base, a knowledgeable tree search algorithm, and a self-adaptive coding strategy.

Result: The framework achieves better performance on automated data science benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods with qualitative and efficiency advantages.

Conclusion: AutoMind is a promising step toward efficient and fully automated data science solutions by overcoming existing limitations in LLM-based frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

*Sohee Yang,Sang-Woo Lee,Nora Kassner,Daniela Gottesman,Sebastian Riedel,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Models can identify unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from them, especially larger models, highlighting limitations in their self-reevaluation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess reasoning models' ability to self-reevaluate and recover from unhelpful thoughts within their decision-making process.

Method: The study investigates the performance of reasoning models when unhelpful thoughts are injected, analyzing their ability to identify and recover from four specific types of harmful thought patterns.

Result: Models can effectively recognize unhelpful thoughts but suffer significant performance drops when trying to recover from them. Larger models exhibit worse performance compared to smaller ones during reevaluation.

Conclusion: Reasoning models require refined self-reevaluation mechanisms to enhance reasoning accuracy and demonstrate safer behavior. Improvements are especially needed in larger models.

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

*Chenjian Gao,Lihe Ding,Xin Cai,Zhanpeng Huang,Zibin Wang,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mask-based LoRA tuning approach to enhance flexibility and efficiency in video editing via diffusion models, adapting pretrained Image-to-Video models without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods leveraging diffusion models are powerful but limited in flexibility, particularly in propagating controlled edits beyond the initial frame.

Method: The authors propose a mask-driven LoRA tuning mechanism for pretrained Image-to-Video models. The method combines spatial structure and motion cues from input videos with appearance guidance from reference images, using a spatial mask to distinguish and guide attention to appropriate regions.

Result: The approach achieves superior video editing results compared to existing state-of-the-art methodologies, providing more efficient and flexible editing capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses limitations of prior approaches, offering controllable and efficient video editing by preserving backgrounds and flexibly propagating edits using a mask-based LoRA tuning strategy.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepTraverse is a vision architecture inspired by classical search algorithms, enabling systematic feature learning for interpretable decision-making in image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional vision backbones rely on uniform operations, lacking adaptive, iterative feature refinement. The paper seeks to implement a structured, algorithmic flow similar to classical search algorithms for better interpretability and efficiency.

Method: The approach constructs DeepTraverse with recursive exploration modules for systematic feature analysis and adaptive calibration modules to dynamically adjust feature salience, inspired by classical search strategies.

Result: DeepTraverse demonstrates superior performance in image classification benchmarks, achieving competitive accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often surpassing conventional models.

Conclusion: Integrating algorithmic priors like those in DeepTraverse provides an effective pathway for creating efficient, high-performing vision backbones with structured processing capabilities.

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

Motivation: To improve the generalization of progress estimation models to new tasks, environments, and contexts, especially when these differ from training data.

Method: They use a gradient-based meta-learning technique to train models on expert trajectories and natural language task descriptions, enabling test-time adaptation.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art in-context learning approaches in various out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Test-time adaptation enhances the ability of progress estimation models to rely on semantic content and adapt across tasks and environments.

Abstract: We propose a test-time adaptation method that enables a progress estimation
model to adapt online to the visual and temporal context of test trajectories
by optimizing a learned self-supervised objective. To this end, we introduce a
gradient-based meta-learning strategy to train the model on expert visual

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientVLA addresses computational and memory inefficiencies in Vision-Language-Action models by introducing a training-free inference acceleration framework, improving speed and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the computational and memory bottlenecks in Vision-Language-Action models, which limit their deployability despite their transformative potential.

Method: EfficientVLA integrates three strategies: layer pruning in the language module, token optimization in visual processing, and caching/reusing features in the diffusion-based action head.

Result: EfficientVLA accelerates inference speed by 1.93X, reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, while maintaining a minimal drop of 0.6% in success rate on the SIMPLER benchmark.

Conclusion: EfficientVLA effectively addresses the inefficiencies in Vision-Language-Action models, improving performance and deployability without significant loss in accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the lack of datasets or benchmarks for detecting depictions of minors in digital content using machine learning tools, especially in multi-modal settings.

Method: The researchers created the ICCWD dataset with 10,000 image-caption pairs manually labeled for the presence or absence of a child, and used it to benchmark three detection methods, including a commercial age estimation tool.

Result: The best detection method tested achieved a 75.3% true positive rate, highlighting the challenge of the task.

Conclusion: The ICCWD dataset provides a valuable resource for improving minor detection methods across various contexts, paving the way for advancements in automated tools for regulating digital content depicting minors.

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Motivation: To identify the best architecture for automated psoriasis detection using medical images.

Method: Pre-trained CNNs and ViTs were fine-tuned on a specific dataset and their classification performance was analyzed.

Result: ViTs, especially DaViT-B, outperformed CNNs achieving an f1-score of 96.4%.

Conclusion: ViTs are highly effective for medical image classification, with DaViT-B as the recommended architecture for psoriasis detection.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of the performance of Convolutional Neural

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViCrit, a method using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve vision-language models (VLMs) by training them to identify subtle visual errors in captions paired with images, resulting in significant performance gains across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL techniques for vision-language models face challenges due to the unavailability of verifiable vision-centric tasks. This study aims to tackle this limitation by creating a robust task for training VLMs.

Method: The proposed ViCrit task injects small, synthetic errors into human-written image captions and trains VLMs to detect the errors using an RL-based proxy task. A systematic evaluation benchmark, ViCrit-Bench, is also presented.

Result: VLMs trained on ViCrit demonstrated significant improvements on multiple VL benchmarks, with the learned capabilities extending to settings like abstract image reasoning and visual math.

Conclusion: The fine-grained hallucination detection task (ViCrit) offers an effective, generalizable framework to improve the perceptual abilities of vision-language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

TL;DR: RoCA is a Gaussian process-based framework for improving domain robustness in E2E autonomous driving, achieving better cross-domain generalization and adaptation without extra inference computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of deploying end-to-end autonomous driving systems across different domains, such as cities, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: The proposed RoCA framework models the joint probabilistic distribution over driving scene tokens using a Gaussian process, enabling generalization by learning basis tokens and trajectories across diverse scenarios.

Result: RoCA improves generalization of base E2E models in source-domain training and demonstrates superior adaptation performance on new domains compared to direct finetuning.

Conclusion: RoCA enhances cross-domain robustness and generalization in E2E autonomous driving systems, addressing domain adaptation challenges without introducing extra inference computational overhead.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

*Mohammad Jalali,Haoyu Lei,Amin Gohari,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SPARKE, a novel method for improving diversity in prompt-guided diffusion models by utilizing scalable entropy-based diversity measures, which enhances diversity without significant computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of adequate diversity in generated samples from prompt-guided diffusion models, especially when prompts span broad semantic areas, motivated the authors to explore improvements in diversity that are prompt-aware.

Method: The authors developed SPARKE, a method using conditional Rényi Kernel Entropy to enable scalable and prompt-aware diversity guidance. It reduces computational complexity of entropy calculation from O(n^3) to O(n), making it efficient for large-scale sampling.

Result: The SPARKE method demonstrated improved diversity in generated outputs from text-to-image diffusion models while maintaining manageable computational requirements.

Conclusion: SPARKE advances diversity guidance in prompt-driven diffusion models, offering a computationally efficient and scalable approach to achieve prompt-aware diversity.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces an attention-based model for solar radiation retrieval from satellite imagery that improves accuracy in mountainous regions by implicitly learning surface reflectance dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methodologies for solar radiation retrieval struggle in complex terrains, such as mountainous regions, due to dynamic surface conditions like intermittent snow, which impact background reflectance calculations.

Method: The study develops an attention-based emulator using Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer, trained on multi-spectral satellite imagery and solar geometry data from Switzerland, eliminating the need for hand-crafted inputs.

Result: The proposed model matches the performance of albedo-informed models and significantly improves accuracy in complex terrains, particularly in mountainous areas.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates surface reflectance dynamics and generalizes well across diverse topographies, demonstrating its potential for geospatial applications in complex settings.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Efficient Probing (EP), a computationally efficient alternative to linear and attentive probing methods for evaluating self-supervised learning models, achieving better performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear probing does not adequately reflect the potential of Masked Image Modeling (MIM) due to the distributed nature of patch tokens, and existing attentive probing methods are inefficient and over-parameterized.

Method: The authors systematically analyze current probing techniques and propose Efficient Probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that reduces redundant projections, decreases trainable parameters, and improves computational speed.

Result: EP achieves up to 10x speed-ups, outperforms traditional Linear Probing (LP) and attentive probing methods across seven benchmarks, generalizes across pretraining paradigms, and delivers interpretable results in low-shot and layer-wise scenarios.

Conclusion: Efficient Probing resolves key limitations of existing probing methods, providing a scalable, interpretable, and effective solution for evaluating self-supervised models. The method balances accuracy with efficiency, making it a valuable contribution to the field.

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

*Fiona Ryan,Josef Sivic,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Judy Hoffman,James M. Rehg,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new approach to improve personalized vision-language retrieval by adapting a vision-language dual encoder's language encoder using low-rank parameters and new evaluation standards for general knowledge preservation, achieving superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized vision-language retrieval is difficult because it must seamlessly incorporate personal concepts (e.g., "my dog Fido") with general knowledge, utilizing limited data for new concepts.

Method: The approach focuses on regularized low-rank adaptation of parameters in the language encoder's final layer, exploring techniques to combine multiple learned personal concepts, such as parameter addition.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in personalized image retrieval with natural language queries on benchmarks DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi, outperforming prior metrics by 4%-22%. Introduced a metric assessing general knowledge preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts vision-language models for personalized retrieval tasks, combining personal and general knowledge while maintaining retrieval accuracy across contexts, setting new benchmarks for evaluation and performance standards.

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

*Parsa Rahimi,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScoreMix introduces a data augmentation method using diffusion models to boost discriminator performance, especially with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve discriminative model capabilities by addressing challenges in scenarios with insufficient labeled data and exploring the correlation between generator and discriminator spaces.

Method: The method involves convexly mixing scores from class-conditioned trajectories during diffusion sampling, generating synthetic samples for training.

Result: ScoreMix improves performance across benchmarks, with higher gains when distant embedding classes are mixed, and reveals minimal correlation between generator and discriminator spaces.

Conclusion: ScoreMix is practical, delivering significant improvements without complex parameter tuning and effectively mitigating large dataset challenges for discriminators.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study presents a crop yield benchmark dataset for California (2008-2022) with data from satellites, climate records, evapotranspiration, and soil properties, using a deep learning model achieving strong predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate crop yield forecasting in California is challenging due to complex factors, despite abundant historical yield data, driving the need for improved techniques.

Method: The authors created a benchmark dataset combining diverse data (satellite imagery, climate records, soil properties) and developed a multi-modal deep learning model with stratified feature extraction and timeseries encoding.

Result: The proposed model achieved an R2 score of 0.76 across all crops in the unseen test dataset, demonstrating robust predictive performance.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset and modeling framework enhance agricultural forecasting and can assist in climate adaptation and precision farming, with data and code publicly available.

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at

*Rajeev Yasarla,Shizhong Han,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DySS, a novel method for efficient 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) using a state-space model (SSM) and dynamic query updates, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the inefficiencies of traditional dense BEV feature construction and the high computational cost of existing query-based 3D object detection methods, especially when handling multiple video frames.

Method: DySS employs a state-space model (SSM) for sequential feature processing over time and uses tasks like future prediction and masked reconstruction for better training. Additionally, it dynamically updates detection queries using merge, remove, and split operations.

Result: DySS achieves superior performance and efficiency, including 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP on the nuScenes test split, and 56.2 NDS, 46.2 mAP, and 33 FPS inference speed on the validation split.

Conclusion: DySS sets a new state-of-the-art in BEV-based 3D object detection, offering both high detection accuracy and real-time efficiency.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HalLoc, an efficient dataset and model for probabilistic hallucination detection in large vision-language models, addressing reliability concerns in tasks like VQA, instruction-following, and image captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations undermine the reliability of vision-language models, necessitating efficient detection methods while accounting for ambiguity between truth and hallucination in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors developed HalLoc, a token-level annotated dataset with 150K samples across multiple tasks and a lightweight baseline model for concurrent hallucination detection during generation, which can integrate into existing VLMs.

Result: HalLoc provides a resource to train models for detecting hallucinations with graded confidence, and the baseline model demonstrates low resource demands while improving detection efficiency.

Conclusion: HalLoc and its associated model enhance the reliability of vision-language models by offering a probabilistic approach to hallucination detection, paving the way for trustworthy real-world applications with minimal performance overhead.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes deep learning (DL) models for skin cancer classification using transfer learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ), showing CLIP-based models and ensemble methods are optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve skin cancer diagnosis by addressing performance limitations in deep learning models caused by insufficient data and lack of uncertainty awareness.

Method: The research utilized the HAM10000 dataset to evaluate pre-trained DL feature extractors with various classifiers, followed by incorporating uncertainty quantification techniques like Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and EMCD.

Result: CLIP ViT-H/14 combined with SVM achieved the best classification results, while ensemble methods balanced accuracy and uncertainty handling effectively.

Conclusion: Integrating uncertainty quantification into DL models enhances reliability and trustworthiness for clinical skin cancer diagnoses.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the labor-intensive process of manually generating SOAP notes, which contributes to clinician burnout, while ensuring scalable and clinically accurate documentation with fewer annotations required.

Method: The authors propose a weakly supervised multimodal framework utilizing lesion images and sparse clinical text to automatically generate SOAP notes without heavy dependence on manual annotation.

Result: The method performs comparably to existing tools like GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro in key clinical relevance metrics. Additionally, two new metrics—MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS)—are introduced for evaluating clinical quality.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates effectiveness in generating clinically structured notes, reducing annotation load and clinician burnout, while maintaining alignment with expert medical concepts and clinical input features.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) for user-generated omnidirectional videos (ODVs) and address the gap in research on UGC ODV quality analysis.

Method: A dataset of 300 user-generated ODVs of 10 different scene types was created using two omnidirectional cameras. Subjective experiments provided Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs), and a baseline AVQA model using video and audio feature extraction and fusion modules was developed.

Result: The AVQA baseline model demonstrated superior performance in audio-visual quality assessment using the proposed dataset.

Conclusion: This study lays foundational work for AVQA in user-generated ODV content by offering a dataset and developing a performant baseline model for further research.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

TL;DR: This paper explores Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for analyzing students' academic emotions using facial expressions with zero-shot prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address limitations in traditional supervised machine learning for emotion analysis, such as poor generalization and reliance on repetitive annotation and training.

Method: The researchers employed two Vision-Language Models, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to classify academic emotions from 5,000 images using zero-shot prompting.

Result: The models showed moderate performance overall, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, particularly in recognizing confused and happy expressions, but struggled with distracted behavior detection.

Conclusion: Vision-Language Models exhibit promise for emotion analysis in online learning environments, especially for identifying confusion and happiness, while highlighting areas for improvement like detecting distraction.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for improving 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering quality from limited input views by using feature enhancement and point interaction networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of 3DGS when reconstructing scenes with sparse training views, which often leads to degradation in rendering quality.

Method: The framework utilizes a stereo foundation model for camera pose estimation and dense point cloud reconstruction, multiscale 2D feature aggregation for color attributes, and a point interaction network with self-attention for improving Gaussian representation. Parameters are rendered using lightweight multi-layer perceptrons.

Result: The proposed approach achieves significantly better performance than NeRF-based methods and comparable results to state-of-the-art 3DGS techniques under few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enables real-time, high-quality rendering from sparse views, advancing the usability of 3DGS for scene representations even with limited input.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

*Zhanwei Zhang,Kaiyuan Liu,Junjie Liu,Wenxiao Wang,Binbin Lin,Liang Xie,Chen Shen,Deng Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoCAD is a CAD generation method allowing local geometry modification based on user-provided geometric instructions, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD generation methods struggle with implementing local geometric changes based on user instructions, making design modification inefficient.

Method: GeoCAD generates local geometric instructions through a complementary captioning strategy (vertex-based and VLLM-based). During training, it uses these instructions and remaining CAD parts to mask and predict local parts. The system prompts large language models to ensure adherence to instructions.

Result: Extensive experiments validate GeoCAD's superiority in generation quality, geometric validity, and consistency with text instructions.

Conclusion: GeoCAD offers a novel solution for user-guided local CAD modifications, improving design flexibility and quality.

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a novel research framework using vision-language models to quantitatively analyze urban streetscape style differences between Beijing and Shenzhen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on urban culture and architecture depend heavily on subjective expert interpretation and historical documentation, which lacks scalability and standardization.

Method: The authors propose a multimodal framework utilizing vision-language models. They create 'UrbanDiffBench,' a dataset of urban streetscape images, and 'UrbanSense,' a tool for quantitative comparison of urban styles.

Result: Over 80% of generated descriptions pass statistical significance (t-test, p<0.05), and subjective evaluations yield high Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods), affirming the method’s precision in identifying style variations.

Conclusion: The approach enables objective and scalable analysis of urban style evolution, providing a data-driven foundation for future urban design decisions.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

*Mina C. Moghadam,Alan Q. Wang,Omer Taub,Martin R. Prince,Mert R. Sabuncu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RealKeyMorph (RKM) introduces a machine learning-based method for resolution-agnostic medical image registration by avoiding resampling and leveraging real-world coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image registration in medical applications often suffers from artifacts due to resampling images of differing resolutions, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

Method: RKM extends KeyMorph to learn and transform keypoints into real-world coordinates using scanner affine matrices, avoiding interpolation artifacts.

Result: RKM successfully demonstrated superiority in registration tasks involving orthogonal 2D abdominal MRI stacks and 3D brain volumes of varying resolutions.

Conclusion: RKM enhances image registration by eliminating resolution dependency, broadening its applicability in medical imaging with improved precision.

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

*Runqi Ouyang,Haoyun Li,Zhenyuan Zhang,Xiaofeng Wang,Zheng Zhu,Guan Huang,Xingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-R1 gives better control, consistency, and diversity in text-to-motion generation by using a Chain-of-Thought mechanism and specialized training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-motion approaches struggle with deep linguistic structures, logical reasoning, and producing consistent, controllable, and diverse motions.

Method: Introduced Motion-R1, which leverages a Chain-of-Thought mechanism to decompose textual instructions into structured action paths, and uses Group Relative Policy Optimization for training with motion quality feedback.

Result: Motion-R1 performs competitively or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, especially in complex semantic and long-term coherence tasks.

Conclusion: Motion-R1 significantly improves text-to-motion generation's interpretability, execution, and temporal coherence, making it suitable for complex commands. Public code and data will be provided.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

an efficient and practical solution for real-time face recognition on

TL;DR: The paper introduces FSATFusion, an advanced Transformer-based network for infrared and visible image fusion, improving feature capture and outperforming existing methods in both image fusion and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing methods, particularly the inability of convolution operations to capture global context effectively, thereby improving performance in image fusion.

Method: Proposed the FSATFusion network that includes the Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer (FSAT) with a Frequency-Spatial Attention Mechanism (FSAM) and introduces an Improved Transformer Module (ITM) to enhance global context extraction.

Result: Experimental results highlight the superior fusion quality, efficiency, and generalization of FSATFusion. Its effectiveness was also validated in additional tasks and downstream visual applications, such as object detection.

Conclusion: FSATFusion demonstrates significant advances in image fusion and visual tasks, offering a more robust and efficient solution compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

*Laziz U. Abdullaev,Maksim Tkachenko,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper provides a unifying framework to better interpret the self-attention mechanism in Transformers, focusing on its components and proposing two architectural modifications that improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a robust theoretical framework for explaining the success and limitations of self-attention mechanisms in Transformer architectures.

Method: Developed a unifying image processing framework to explain self-attention and its components, and proposed two independent architectural modifications.

Result: The proposed modifications improve not only interpretability but also accuracy, robustness against adversarial attacks, and performance on long sequence understanding.

Conclusion: The framework enhances understanding of self-attention while demonstrating practical benefits in performance across language and vision tasks.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

*Jerry Yan,Chinmay Talegaonkar,Nicholas Antipa,Eric Terrill,Sophia Merrifield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computer vision system, PoseIDON, for estimating the burial state of objects on the seafloor and analyzing underwater sediment dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of burial depth estimation for anthropogenic objects on the seafloor, which has ecological, environmental, and recovery implications.

Method: The study developed PoseIDON, a pipeline combining deep learning features and multiview photogrammetry to determine object pose and seafloor orientation, using ROV video and CAD model alignment.

Result: The method was validated on 54 objects at a dumpsite, achieving a mean burial depth error of ~10 cm and revealing sediment transport patterns.

Conclusion: PoseIDON enables scalable and non-invasive mapping of seafloor conditions, aiding environmental assessments and management of contaminated sites.

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

*Shicheng Yin,Kaixuan Yin,Yang Liu,Weixing Chen,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DART, a novel approach to tokenizing image patches for Vision Transformer models, improving detail representation and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision models like ViT often encode excessive background and miss local details with fixed-size patches; DART aims to improve this by adaptive patch sizing.

Method: DART dynamically partitions images using learnable region scores and quantile operations, allocating more tokens to information-rich areas.

Result: DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT with 45% FLOPs reduction and minimal computational overhead across multiple models.

Conclusion: DART provides efficient and accurate image tokenization, enhancing Vision Transformer models with better local detail handling and reduced computations.

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

*Yuanyi Song,Pumeng Lyu,Ben Fei,Fenghua Ling,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReconMOST, a novel diffusion model framework designed for reconstructing ocean temperature fields using sparse observational data and historical simulation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and scope of ocean temperature reconstruction, overcoming the limitations of sparse data, algorithmic constraints, and handling cloud occlusion issues in local and sea surface reconstructions.

Method: The paper pre-trains an unconditional diffusion model with historical numerical simulation data and utilizes sparse observational data as guidance during the reverse diffusion process to ensure physically consistent patterns in ocean temperature reconstructions.

Result: ReconMOST reconstructed accurate multi-layer sea temperature fields globally, addressing over 92.5% missing data with low mean squared error values (0.049 for guidance, 0.680 for reconstruction, and 0.633 overall).

Conclusion: ReconMOST proves to be effective and robust, expanding machine learning's capability for global, multi-layer ocean temperature reconstruction with improved generalization and reliability.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

TL;DR: Pisces introduces a unified multimodal model addressing challenges in both image understanding and generation through a decoupled visual encoding architecture and optimized training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a unified model capable of strong performance in both image understanding and generation, which is currently a gap as specialized models outperform unified ones.

Method: Pisces employs a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training, along with careful data curation, pretraining, and finetuning.

Result: Pisces achieves strong performance on over 20 image understanding benchmarks and excels in generative tasks in the GenEval benchmark.

Conclusion: Pisces demonstrates the benefits of decoupled encoders and showcases that image understanding and generation can synergistically enhance unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LRRNet, an infrared small target detection framework that leverages low-rank background properties to overcome challenges like low SCR and diverse target shapes. It outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods and achieves real-time performance at 82.34 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenge of detecting small infrared targets in complex backgrounds, which are plagued by low signal-to-clutter ratios, diverse target morphologies, and the lack of distinctive visual cues. Existing deep learning methods have unstable performance due to the weak priors and intrinsic variability of small targets.

Method: The paper proposes LRRNet, an end-to-end framework using a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations. Unlike traditional methods, it avoids patch-based processing or explicit matrix decomposition, instead leveraging deep neural networks for learning low-rank structures.

Result: LRRNet surpasses 38 state-of-the-art methods across various public datasets in terms of detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. It achieves an average speed of 82.34 FPS, demonstrating real-time performance. Additionally, evaluations on the NoisySIRST dataset confirm its resilience to sensor noise.

Conclusion: The LRRNet framework successfully tackles the challenge of infrared small target detection by directly learning low-rank image structures in an end-to-end manner. It establishes new benchmarks in both efficiency and accuracy, validating its potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MF2Summ, a multimodal video summarization model that integrates visual and auditory information, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in key benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of traditional video summarization methods, which rely on a single modality and fail to capture the semantic richness of videos.

Method: MF2Summ uses a five-stage process: feature extraction, cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key shot selection. It integrates visual and auditory features using techniques like cross-modal Transformer and alignment-guided self-attention Transformer.

Result: MF2Summ achieves competitive performance on the SumMe and TVSum datasets, improving F1-scores by 1.9% and 0.6% over the DSNet model, respectively.

Conclusion: By effectively modeling inter-modal dependencies and leveraging multimodal data, MF2Summ provides a more comprehensive video summarization approach, demonstrating strong results against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CIDer, a robust multimodal emotion recognition framework tackling modality missing and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. It integrates a self-distillation and causal inference module and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in Multimodal Emotion Recognition related to modality missing and OOD data, and to overcome the reliance on models with excessive parameters.

Method: The proposed method, CIDer, includes two key modules: Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) for robust performance under missing modality challenges and Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) for handling OOD data biases. It also introduces new architectures and tasks like RMFM and datasets for experimentation.

Result: Experimental results show that CIDer performs robustly in RMFM and OOD scenarios with fewer parameters and faster training compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CIDer demonstrates advancements in handling challenges in MER with a balance of efficiency and robustness, establishing itself as a practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

*Bolin Chen,Ru-Ling Liao,Jie Chen,Yan Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces IMT (Implicit Motion Transformation) to enhance generative human video compression by replacing explicit motion guidance with implicit approaches, achieving better compression and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of conventional generative human video coding approaches that rely on explicit motion guidance due to its issues with severe distortions and inaccurate motion in complex human body videos.

Method: The authors proposed the IMT paradigm, which compacts human body video signals into visual features and transforms these features into implicit motion guidance for signal reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed IMT approach improves the compression efficiency and reconstruction quality of generative human video coding.

Conclusion: IMT offers a promising strategy for overcoming the challenges in explicit motion-based methods, achieving higher compression efficiency and more reliable synthesis in human video compression.

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

*Chun Liu,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zheng Zheng,Zheng Li,Wei Yang,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve the transferability of adversarial examples for hyperspectral images (HSI) classification by employing random block transformations and feature distancing loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial attack methods for HSIs are limited due to the complex, high-dimensional spectral data in comparison to natural images, necessitating novel methods to enhance adversarial transferability.

Method: The method involves random division of HSI images into spatial and spectral blocks, applying diverse transformations to mitigate overfitting, and introducing a feature distancing loss that disrupts true-class features in intermediate layers to improve adversarial robustness.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method significantly enhances the transferability of adversarial examples to black-box models across two public HSI datasets and remains effective even under defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: The method successfully advances transfer-based adversarial attack techniques for HSI classification, showcasing improved adaptability and robustness against black-box models and defenses.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

### [131] [Starting Positions Matter: A Study on Better Weight Initialization for Neural Network Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10463)
*Stone Yun,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of weight initialization on the quantization robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs), introducing a novel method using Graph Hypernetworks (GHN) for quantization-aware training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on improving weight initialization for quantization robustness in DNN training, despite the known impact of initialization on floating-point model accuracy.

Method: An extensive study investigating the effects of various weight initialization techniques on the quantization robustness of CNN architectures, and introducing GHN-based methods for predicting quantization-robust parameters, including finetuning for quantized graphs (GHN-QAT).

Result: GHN-QAT greatly improves quantized accuracy, showing notable gains for even 4-bit and 2-bit quantization setups, achieving better-than-random outcomes for the latter.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that weight initialization can significantly affect quantization robustness, and GHN-QAT introduces a novel and effective approach to enhance quantized DNN performance, paving the way for further innovations in quantization-aware training.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

*Yu Huang,Zelin Peng,Yichen Zhao,Piao Yang,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MedSeg-R, a framework for medical image reasoning segmentation, and a new dataset, MedSeg-QA, enabling accurate segmentation masks from complex medical instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image segmentation methods lack advanced reasoning abilities and struggle with generating precise segmentation masks for complex clinical questions.

Method: MedSeg-R uses a global context understanding module for interpreting images and medical instructions and a pixel-level grounding module for producing segmentation masks and textual responses. A new dataset, MedSeg-QA, is also introduced.

Result: MedSeg-R demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy and interpretability across various benchmarks, supported by the new MedSeg-QA dataset.

Conclusion: MedSeg-R addresses the limitations of existing models, combining multimodal reasoning and precise mask generation, thus advancing automatic medical diagnosis capabilities.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical
images.

*Shahroz Tariq,David Nguyen,M. A. P. Chamikara,Tingmin Wu,Alsharif Abuadbba,Kristen Moore*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude show potential in deepfake detection but are not yet standalone solutions, with issues like misinterpretation of stylistic elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of advanced VLMs in addressing the growing challenge posed by sophisticated deepfakes.

Method: Conducted zero-shot evaluation using authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources across three deepfake categories (faceswap, reenactment, synthetic generation).

Result: VLMs demonstrated coherent reasoning but struggled with reliability, emphasizing stylistic elements and being misled by certain patterns.

Conclusion: VLMs could complement human expertise in hybrid forensic workflows but are insufficient for autonomous deepfake detection currently.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a standardized benchmark and nuanced evaluation metrics in Optical Music Recognition research.

Method: The authors developed the SMB dataset with diverse notation styles and introduced the OMR-NED metric for detailed error analysis in OMR.

Result: The paper provides a structured dataset (SMB) and a fine-grained evaluation metric (OMR-NED), tested with baseline experiments, filling a notable gap in OMR research.

Conclusion: SMB and OMR-NED offer tools enabling effective OMR benchmarking, facilitating advancements in OMR methodologies.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music
Recognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical
textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

*Guyang Zhang,Waleed Abdulla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study develops a novel method combining continual backpropagation (CB) with class-incremental learning (CIL) to improve honey botanical origin differentiation using hyperspectral imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in differentiating botanical origins of honey using AI models, especially when collecting all varieties of honey simultaneously is impractical.

Method: The study compares multiple CIL algorithms on a honey hyperspectral imaging dataset and introduces a CB technique to enhance network plasticity by reinitializing underutilized hidden neurons.

Result: The CB method improved the performance of most CIL algorithms by 1-7% in experiments.

Conclusion: CB effectively enhances CIL methods, providing an improved approach for botanical origin differentiation in honey using hyperspectral imaging datasets.

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSLG-SAM, a two-stage method for reducing annotation workload in the Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in RRSIS tasks such as dense annotation and complex scene interpretation by proposing a novel segmentation framework.

Method: Proposes a two-stage approach: coarse localization using a visual grounding network, and fine segmentation guided by SAM, enhanced by clustering and iterative strategies, with reduced dependence on training.

Result: The proposed PSLG-SAM framework demonstrates significant performance improvements on two datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M), outperforming existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM effectively addresses RRSIS challenges by segmenting objects precisely in specific regions, reducing annotation burden, and introducing a new manual dataset, with code to be made available.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces J-DDL, an advanced system leveraging 2D and 3D visual data for precise damage detection and localization on fighter aircraft surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for more scalable, efficient, and consistent methods for inspecting fighter aircraft surfaces due to limitations inherent in manual inspection processes.

Method: J-DDL utilizes a combination of laser scanners and cameras to capture 2D images and 3D point clouds, integrates a YOLO-based novel damage detection network, and maps detected anomalies onto 3D point clouds.

Result: The system ensures detailed and accurate identification and localization of surface defects across aircraft exteriors. Additionally, a specialized publicly available dataset is developed for aircraft damage.

Conclusion: J-DDL has the potential to significantly improve automated aircraft inspection technologies, achieving better scalability and enhanced defect detection capabilities.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

Method: The authors propose CogReasoner, a model that efficiently manages streaming video reasoning through visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval. They also provide a densely annotated dataset for task evaluation.

Result: Experimental results indicate that CogReasoner effectively handles the CogStream task, demonstrating efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: CogStream enhances the capability of Vid-LLMs in real-world streaming scenarios by optimizing context relevance, with the CogReasoner model showing promising results.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured

*Imanol Solano,Julian Fierrez,Aythami Morales,Alejandro Peña,Ruben Tolosana,Francisco Zamora-Martinez,Javier San Agustin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a new metric for detecting demographic bias in face recognition systems, focusing on tail probabilities and overall score distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demographic bias in face recognition systems often goes undetected using current evaluation metrics, especially in the extremes (tails) of score distributions, leading to fairness concerns.

Method: The paper proposes the CEI metric, which separately analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions, incorporates tail probabilities, and assesses overall distribution shapes. An automated version, CEI^A, is also developed for application simplicity.

Result: Experiments demonstrate CEI's superior efficacy in detecting subtle biases in state-of-the-art face recognition systems, biased models, and diverse datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CEI provides a sensitive and adaptable metric for evaluating fairness in face recognition systems and can be used for analyzing tail distributions in other statistical problems.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Conclusion: LRSLAM provides a more efficient, scalable approach to dense visual SLAM, addressing computational and memory limitations while maintaining or improving quality.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has been crucial across various
domains, including autonomous driving, mobile robotics, and mixed reality.
Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces
challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for
large-scale scenes. Recent approaches utilizing neural implicit scene
representations show promise but suffer from high computational costs and
memory requirements. ESLAM introduced a plane-based tensor decomposition but
still struggled with memory growth. Addressing these challenges, we propose a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve e-commerce product presentation by resolving issues in existing frameworks that create unrealistic video demonstrations due to poor identity preservation and spatial interaction.

Method: The proposed framework employs paired reference data and masked cross-attention, incorporates motion guidance through 3D body mesh and bounding boxes, and uses structured text encoding for enhanced consistency.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in preserving identities, product details, and creating realistic human-product interactions.

Conclusion: The DiT-based framework enables high-quality human-product demonstration videos, providing better identity integrity and realistic motions for e-commerce and digital marketing.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

### [146] [Improving Medical Visual Representation Learning with Pathological-level Cross-Modal Alignment and Correlation Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10573)
*Jun Wang,Lixing Zhu,Xiaohan Yu,Abhir Bhalerao,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents "PLACE," a framework for learning medical visual representations from images and reports by aligning pathological-level observations and exploring fine-grained details without requiring additional annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of learning from complex and lengthy medical reports, especially with data scarcity, while ensuring pathological-level consistency across modalities (images and reports).

Method: The method includes a Pathological-Level Cross-Modal Alignment (PCMA) that ensures consistency between observed pathologies in images and reports. A Visual Pathology Observation Extractor is used to extract representations without external annotations. Additionally, a proxy task is designed to identify correlations in image patches, enhancing fine-grained understanding.

Result: PLACE achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple downstream tasks, such as classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection, and report generation.

Conclusion: By promoting pathological-level alignment and enriching image details without additional human annotations, PLACE demonstrates robust generalizability and effectiveness across various medical visual tasks.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

### [147] [DanceChat: Large Language Model-Guided Music-to-Dance Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10574)
*Qing Wang,Xiaohang Yang,Yilan Dong,Naveen Raj Govindaraj,Gregory Slabaugh,Shanxin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DanceChat proposes a method to bridge the gap between music and dance generation using a Large Language Model (LLM) for textual guidance, achieving better-aligned and diverse dance motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Music-to-dance generation faces challenges due to the semantic gap between abstract musical cues and physical dance motion, as well as the one-to-many mapping that makes it hard to generate diverse dances from limited music-dance data.

Method: DanceChat leverages an LLM to generate high-level textual motion instructions, combines multi-modal features from music and text, and employs a diffusion-based motion synthesis module with alignment loss for synchronized dance generation.

Result: DanceChat achieves better alignment with both musical and textual cues compared to previous methods, demonstrating superior performance on datasets like AIST++ and through human evaluations.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel LLM-guided framework that improves diversity and synchronization in music-to-dance generation, offering advancements over existing methods.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Chun-Mei Feng,Kai Yu,Xinxing Xu,Salman Khan,Rick Siow Mong Goh,Wangmeng Zuo,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2I-PAL enhances multi-label recognition by converting text into photorealistic images, addressing modality gaps in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the modality gap of vision-language models like CLIP when fine-tuning with text-only inputs for image recognition.

Method: Utilizes a text-to-image generation model to create diverse images from captions, along with class-wise heatmaps, learnable prototypes, and combined prompt tuning and adapter learning.

Result: Achieved a 3.47% increase in performance compared to state-of-the-art methods over benchmarks like MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE.

Conclusion: T2I-PAL reduces reliance on annotated image data, improves multi-label recognition, and integrates seamlessly with CLIP-based frameworks.

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

### [149] [Harmonizing Geometry and Uncertainty: Diffusion with Hyperspheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10576)
*Muskan Dosi,Chiranjeev Chiranjeev,Kartik Thakral,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperSphereDiff, a diffusion model tailored to preserve the class geometry of hyperspherical data, enhancing generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise and struggle with non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical manifolds. This leads to loss of angular geometric patterns governed by hypercones.

Method: HyperSphereDiff employs directional noise to align generative processes with hyperspherical structures, preserving angular uncertainties and class geometry in the data modeling process.

Result: The model was tested both theoretically and empirically, showcasing enhanced generative accuracy and geometry preservation across four object datasets and two face datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating angular uncertainty via HyperSphereDiff improves generative model performance on hyperspherical data, aligning with its intrinsic geometry and providing geometry-aware solutions.

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

### [150] [Rethinking Random Masking in Self Distillation on ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10582)
*Jihyeon Seong,Hyunkyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of random masking within self-distillation frameworks like DINO for vision transformer models. By applying random masking only to specific views, it improves robustness and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advancements in self-distillation frameworks like DINO harness random masking strategies, but indiscriminate masking may harm critical semantic information. The paper seeks to address these concerns.

Method: The study employs an asymmetric random masking approach, targeting only the student's global view under DINO’s multi-view augmentation setup while leaving other views untouched. It enhances supervision and robustness.

Result: Testing on DINO-Tiny with mini-ImageNet, the proposed masking strategy yielded improved attention maps, leading to better downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Asymmetric random masking is a promising strategy to make self-distillation frameworks more effective, offering robustness while preserving essential semantic information.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

*Jin Huang,Honghua Chen,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HEA-MM, a hierarchical framework for assessing errors in aircraft CAD models using structured light scanners and 3D point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for high-quality assessment of aircraft CAD models, ensuring performance, stability, and reliability in manufacturing and measurement processes.

Method: HEA-MM performs error analysis at three hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature, using structured light scanners. It includes optimization-based primitive refinement and a two-stage algorithm for detecting circular features.

Result: Experimental results demonstrated that HEA-MM effectively evaluates errors across various aircraft CAD models.

Conclusion: The proposed HEA-MM framework is a practical and effective tool for comprehensive error assessment in aircraft CAD models, improving manufacturing precision.

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

*Xinyuan Liu,Hang Xu,Yike Ma,Yucheng Zhang,Feng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SSP, a novel framework for oriented object detection in densely packed remote sensing scenes using point supervision. SSP significantly improves detection accuracy by leveraging rule-driven and data-driven approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges posed by labor-intensive annotation in high-density remote sensing scenes, focusing on advancing oriented object detection via cost-efficient point supervision methods.

Method: SSP synergizes rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. It features two innovations: spatial partition-based sample assignment and box extraction modulated by semantic maps, enabling pseudo-label generation for training detectors.

Result: SSP demonstrates superior performance on datasets like DOTA-v1.0, achieving 45.78% mAP under point supervision, which surpasses PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%. With architectures like ORCNN and ReDet, it achieves even higher mAPs of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively.

Conclusion: SSP advances the field of oriented object detection with its innovative framework, setting a new benchmark under point supervision and proving its effectiveness in densely packed remote sensing scenarios. The code is publicly available.

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is
available at https://github.com/antxinyuan/ssp.

*Eshan Ramesh,Nishio Takayuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatentCSI is a method that generates images from WiFi CSI measurements using a pretrained latent diffusion model, bypassing complex techniques and offering text-guided control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify image generation from WiFi CSI measurements and improve computational efficiency and quality, avoiding challenges of prior complex methods like GANs.

Method: LatentCSI maps CSI amplitudes into a latent space using a lightweight neural network, applies denoising with text-guided input, and decodes using a pretrained latent diffusion model.

Result: LatentCSI outperforms baseline methods in efficiency and perceptual quality, validated on wide-band CSI and MM-Fi datasets.

Conclusion: LatentCSI provides an innovative and efficient approach to image synthesis with practical advantages like text-guided controllability, outperforming comparable methods.

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

*Liang Yin,Xudong Xie,Zhang Li,Xiang Bai,Yuliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in scene text retrieval by proposing MSTAR, a box-free model that handles diverse query types and eliminates costly bounding box annotations. They also introduce a new benchmark, MQTR, to assess multi-query text retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene text retrieval techniques rely on expensive bounding box annotations and lack a unified retrieval strategy for diverse query types.

Method: The authors propose MSTAR, a box-free approach that uses progressive vision embedding, style-aware instructions, and a multi-instance matching module to improve text retrieval. They also develop a new dataset, MQTR, to evaluate multi-query capabilities.

Result: MSTAR surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text without requiring box annotations and by 8.5% on the MQTR benchmark, showcasing strong performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: The study introduces a cost-efficient solution for scene text retrieval with MSTAR and MQTR, achieving state-of-the-art performance and unification of multiple query types.

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

### [155] [TexTailor: Customized Text-aligned Texturing via Effective Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10612)
*Suin Lee,Dae-Shik Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TexTailor improves view-consistent object texture generation based on textual descriptions through improved sampling, loss functions, and adaptive camera adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from texture inconsistencies across viewpoints due to limited geometry-awareness and insufficient texture integration during synthesis.

Method: The paper introduces a resampling scheme for texture integration, fine-tunes a depth-aware diffusion model, optimizes view-adapted camera positioning, and employs a performance preservation loss.

Result: TexTailor achieved superior results in texture consistency, validated across the Objaverse and ShapeNet car datasets.

Conclusion: TexTailor addresses viewpoint consistency in texture generation by innovatively optimizing texture integration and geometry-aware camera adaptation, advancing state-of-the-art performance in the field.

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting Latent Diffusion Models to chest X-ray medical imaging by improving their text-to-image alignment for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models have remained underexplored in medical imaging due to challenges like limited data and privacy concerns.

Method: The authors propose a fine-tuning framework to enhance multi-modal alignment in pre-trained models for better performance in tasks like phrase grounding.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results on MS-CXR benchmarks and demonstrates robustness on out-of-distribution data like VinDr-CXR.

Conclusion: Latent Diffusion Models can be effectively fine-tuned for multi-modal tasks in medical imaging, pushing benchmarks and ensuring versatile applications.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SymmFlow is a unified framework for image generation, segmentation, and classification, leveraging symmetrical flow matching for high generative diversity and semantic preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to combine segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model, addressing limitations in existing methods like strict mapping constraints and iterative refinements.

Method: SymmFlow employs a symmetric learning objective to model bi-directional transformations, alongside a novel training objective for semantic retention and efficient sampling.

Result: Experimental benchmarks reveal state-of-the-art performance for semantic image synthesis with impressive FID scores and strong results in segmentation and classification tasks.

Conclusion: SymmFlow is a versatile framework offering robust generative modeling and semantic capabilities, with code set to be released for broader impact.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GigaVideo-1 enhances video generation quality in diffusion models using automatic feedback rather than human annotations or external high-quality data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in video generation, such as motion rationality and physical plausibility, without relying on costly human annotations and computational resources.

Method: GigaVideo-1 uses a prompt-driven data engine for diverse training samples and a reward-guided training strategy powered by pre-trained vision-language models.

Result: Experiments on VBench-2.0 show consistent improvements in performance, averaging a 4% gain across 17 dimensions, with minimal resource usage (4 GPU-hours).

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1 offers an efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning video generation with no need for manual annotations or extensive computations; code and model resources will be made public.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

*Marzieh Oghbaie,Teresa Araújoa,Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents PiPViT, a prototype-based model for medical image classification using vision transformers, aimed at improving interpretability while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prototype-based methods struggle with visualizations not aligning with human-understandable biomarkers and often create overly granular prototypes, which reduces interpretability in medical imaging where both presence and extent of lesions are critical.

Method: The authors introduce PiPViT, a vision transformer-based model that uses patch-based prototypes to learn interpretable representations of medical images. It employs contrastive learning and multi-resolution input processing for effective localization of biomarkers.

Result: PiPViT demonstrated competitive performance on retinal OCT image classification over four datasets, providing human-interpretable explanations and delivering semantically and clinically relevant prototypes.

Conclusion: PiPViT enhances interpretability in medical image analysis, offering accurate diagnoses with meaningful explanations, and could support clinicians in decision-making processes.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

*Subhram Dasgupta,Janelle Mason,Xiaohong Yuan,Olusola Odeyomi,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight CNN enhanced with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks for efficient Deepfake detection, achieving high accuracy and competitive performance with reduced computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake technology undermines the authenticity of digital information and poses security risks. Existing detection methods struggle with computational efficiency and high memory consumption.

Method: A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks is designed to dynamically emphasize informative features, integrated within a sequential model for Deepfake detection.

Result: The model achieved a classification accuracy of 94.14% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.985 when tested on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse Fake Face Dataset.

Conclusion: The lightweight CNN with SE blocks is effective for Deepfake detection, offering scalable and computationally efficient solutions for ensuring digital content authenticity.

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

*Xia Du,Xiaoyuan Liu,Jizhe Zhou,Zheng Lin,Chi-man Pun,Zhe Chen,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPTCHA systems are increasingly vulnerable due to advances in deep learning. The paper introduces the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC) framework to counter these vulnerabilities using adversarial attacks guided by text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter vulnerabilities in CAPTCHA schemes exposed by powerful deep neural networks and address limitations in existing adversarial attack methods that distort image quality.

Method: The paper proposes UAC, combining a Large Language Model to enhance CAPTCHA diversity and a diffusion model for targeted attacks. It also introduces the BP-UAC strategy for untargeted attacks using multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization.

Result: The BP-UAC method achieves high success rates in attacking various CAPTCHA systems, creating adversarial examples indistinguishable from legitimate images by human and neural networks.

Conclusion: UAC and BP-UAC frameworks effectively address challenges in traditional CAPTCHA security, offering adaptable high-fidelity solutions suitable for automated attacks in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

*Christopher Gaul,Eduardo Fidalgo,Enrique Alegre,Rocío Alaiz Rodríguez,Eri Pérez Corral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust multi-task age classification framework for minors in unconstrained images, addressing challenges of data imbalance and distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of distribution shift and under-representation of minors in publicly available images for automatic age classification, particularly focusing on legally critical age thresholds.

Method: The proposed approach involves a multi-task architecture built on a frozen FaRL backbone and a two-layer MLP for shared features across regression and binary classification heads. Additionally, it employs class imbalance handling techniques such as re-weighted loss functions and age-balanced sampling.

Result: The model demonstrates improved detection across age thresholds, reducing root-mean-square-error in tests and achieving notable boosts in F-scores for under-age detection, even in scenarios with domain shifts.

Conclusion: The architecture showcases superior generalization abilities and robustness under data imbalances and domain shifts, making it promising for real-world age estimation applications.

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

*Melika Ayoughi,Mina Ghadimi Atigh,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Cees G. M. Snoek,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HyperCLIC, a novel continual learning algorithm leveraging hyperbolic space for hierarchical instance and class recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications, like robotics and self-driving cars, require models that handle both fine-grained instance recognition and coarse-grained class generalization simultaneously, which is not well-addressed by traditional continual learning models.

Method: HyperCLIC uses hyperbolic space to model hierarchical relationships among instances and classes. The framework employs hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives for continual embedding of hierarchical relations.

Result: HyperCLIC demonstrates effective performance across multiple levels of granularity and exhibits improved hierarchical generalization, with validation on the EgoObjects dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully addresses the challenging task of continual learning of instances and classes simultaneously, capitalizing on the natural hierarchical relationships between them.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

*Yuqi Shen,Fengyang Xiao,Sujie Hu,Youwei Pang,Yifan Pu,Chengyu Fang,Xiu Li,Chunming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model to enhance the performance of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) through a generative refinement process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) methods struggle with post-processing refinement due to subtle differences between the target and background, leaving room for improvement.

Method: The researchers propose the UMBD model with an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism for focused generative refinement and a Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network (HUQNet) for accurate uncertainty estimation.

Result: The approach improves COD performance with average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure across multiple benchmarks with minimal computational costs.

Conclusion: UMBD effectively integrates with existing COD models, combining discriminative capabilities with generative refinement for improved detection performance.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to generate synthetic golden standards using Deep Neural Networks for defect detection in Indium-Phosphide wafers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defect detection in Indium-Phosphide wafer manufacturing is challenging due to the unavailability of golden standards caused by low production scale and high design variability.

Method: The authors employ Deep Neural Networks to create photo-realistic wafer images from CAD data, and compare various training objectives.

Result: The proposed deep learning approach improves over traditional decision-tree-based methods in enabling defect detection using simulated golden die.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates efficient defect detection in any user-defined wafer region, aiding the semiconductor manufacturing process.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

*Hong Huang,Weixiang Sun,Zhijian Wu,Jingwen Niu,Donghuan Lu,Xian Wu,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IQE-CLIP, a framework for zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) in the medical domain, overcoming limitations of existing CLIP-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most CLIP-based ZFSAD methods require category knowledge and scenario-specific prompts, which struggle in joint embedding spaces and mostly target industrial domains, with minimal exploration in medical applications.

Method: IQE-CLIP combines class-based and learnable prompts with an instance-aware query module that extracts region-level information from textual and visual modalities to improve anomaly detection.

Result: IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art results in experiments on six medical datasets in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP effectively integrates textual and visual information for medical anomaly detection and generalizes better than existing methodologies.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

TL;DR: PosterCraft is a framework for generating high-aesthetic posters through a unified approach, abandoning modular pipelines and predefined layouts for greater creative flexibility and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality aesthetic posters integrates artistic content and stylistic harmony, which poses challenges unmet by traditional modular or layout-driven methods.

Method: PosterCraft employs a cascaded workflow: large-scale text-rendering, region-aware fine-tuning, aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning, and joint vision-language feedback refinement to enhance poster generation.

Result: PosterCraft significantly outperformed open-source baselines in rendering accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal, rivaling state-of-the-art commercial systems.

Conclusion: The framework delivers robust training and high-quality posters without needing complex architectural adjustments, offering advancements in poster generation and design.

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

*Wenhao Guo,Peng Lu,Xujun Peng,Zhaoran Zhao,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA) for handling ultra-large image upsampling, achieving superior results even at extreme scales like x100 compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods struggle with performance and produce blurring when the upsampling factor exceeds the training data range.

Method: The paper proposes SbCA, which uses a stroke vector amplifier to decompose images into vector graphics for magnification, paired with a detail completion module to restore missing details. The cyclic strategy iteratively refines details within training-scale boundaries, effectively addressing distribution drift and artifact issues.

Result: Experimental tests on synthetic and real-world datasets show that SbCA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks, achieving higher quality and fidelity.

Conclusion: The SbCA model enables ultra-large upsampling for super-resolution tasks by overcoming blurring, artifacts, and noise, offering a unified framework that maintains high visual quality even at extreme magnifications.

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SlotPi, a physics-informed model for visual reasoning about real-world dynamics, showing strong capability in prediction and Visual Question Answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current object-centric models, which neglect the integration of physical knowledge and lack adaptability across diverse scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes SlotPi, which combines a Hamiltonian-based physics module with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic simulation.

Result: SlotPi exhibited robust performance in prediction and Visual Question Answering tasks on benchmark datasets, including a newly introduced real-world dataset containing fluid and object dynamics.

Conclusion: SlotPi's strong adaptability and success across varied datasets provide a foundational model for advancing real-world dynamic prediction and reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep

TL;DR: The paper introduces a zero-shot, text-guided video summarization tool using video-language models (VidLMs) and large language models (LLMs) without domain-specific training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of video summarization approaches that rely on domain-specific data and lack user-controllable natural language queries.

Method: The pipeline includes segmenting videos into scenes, using VidLMs for description generation, employing LLMs for importance scoring, and propagating importance scores across video frames with new metrics for consistency and uniqueness.

Result: The proposed method surpasses unsupervised methods on TVSum and SumMe datasets, competes with supervised techniques on query-focused tasks, and introduces a challenging dataset, VidSum-Reason.

Conclusion: Pretrained multimodal models, paired with effective prompting strategies, offer a strong foundation for universal, text-queryable video summarization.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study presents SmoothProper, a neural module to improve deformable image registration (DIR), especially for datasets with sparse features and large smooth regions like retinal vessels. It overcomes traditional unsupervised DIR limitations by introducing smoothness and interaction during neural forward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised DIR methods typically fail in handling aperture and large-displacement challenges in images with sparse features and smooth regions, due to a lack of post-training constraints on deformation fields.

Method: SmoothProper uses a duality-based optimization layer with custom interaction terms to propagate flow signals, enforce smoothness, and maintain structural integrity during the network's forward pass. It is model-agnostic and plug-and-play with minimal parameter need.

Result: The approach reduced registration error to 1.88 pixels in high-resolution 2912x2912 retinal vessel images, successfully addressing aperture and large-displacement challenges.

Conclusion: SmoothProper provides a significant improvement in unsupervised DIR for challenging datasets, eliminating regularizer tuning and seamlessly integrating into existing frameworks with consistent performance gains.

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurately estimating hand-object poses during occlusions caused by their interactions.

Method: The method, HOMAE, uses a target-focused masking strategy to simulate structured occlusions, learns features for occlusion reasoning using masked autoencoders, and fuses signed distance fields with point clouds for robust pose estimation.

Result: HOMAE outperforms existing methods in hand-object pose estimation across DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses occlusion challenges in hand-object pose estimation and lays a framework for leveraging global and local structural cues. Code and model will be released.

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

*Huaying Yuan,Zheng Liu,Junjie Zhou,Ji-Rong Wen,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoDeepResearch introduces a novel framework to tackle long video understanding (LVU) by relying on text-only reasoning models paired with modular multi-modal tools, achieving notable performance gains on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitations of existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in understanding long video content due to constraints such as context windows and the need for extensive domain expertise.

Method: The authors propose an agentic framework, VideoDeepResearch, which uses a text-only reasoning model alongside modular tools like multi-modal retrievers and visual perceivers. It formulates strategies for LVU tasks through reasoning and selectively accesses video content via tool usage.

Result: Experiments on popular LVU benchmarks show that VideoDeepResearch achieves significant improvements over current MLLM baselines, exceeding the state-of-the-art by up to 9.6%.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that agentic systems like VideoDeepResearch can overcome major challenges in LVU tasks without requiring enhanced context windows or specialized models, showcasing their potential as effective solutions for complex video understanding.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

### [175] [Post-Training Quantization for Video Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10840)
*Tianrui Zhu,Houyuan Chen,Ruihao Gong,Michele Magno,Haotong Qin,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) framework for video matting models, achieving state-of-the-art results even in ultra-low-bit quantizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video matting is computationally intensive, posing challenges for deployment on devices with limited resources. Existing PTQ methods face significant obstacles in maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence for video matting.

Method: The approach includes a two-stage PTQ strategy: fast initial quantization with block-reconstruction optimization, global affine calibration to correct statistical distortions, and optical flow assistance to leverage temporal and semantic priors for enhanced performance.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in video matting tasks across various bit widths. The 4-bit model delivers close-to-full-precision performance while providing eightfold reduction in FLOPs.

Conclusion: This work pioneers the application of a comprehensive PTQ framework for video matting, demonstrating that low-bit quantization can maintain high accuracy and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRBench is a new benchmark designed to test large models' ability in multi-step reasoning using long narrative videos, human-labeled reasoning tasks, and a structured evaluation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of large models often overlook temporal reasoning and procedural validity in analyzing complex narrative content.

Method: VRBench involves 1,010 long videos, human-labeled reasoning tasks, categorizing reasoning types, and uses a human-AI collaborative framework for generating coherent multi-step reasoning chains.

Result: The benchmark evaluates 12 large language models (LLMs) and 16 visual language models (VLMs), offering robust analysis and multi-dimensional scoring mechanisms for reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: VRBench provides a systematic approach to testing and advancing multi-step reasoning in large AI models, offering insights to enhance AI systems in temporal and procedural reasoning.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CreatiPoster, a novel AI framework for generating editable and aesthetically-pleasing graphic designs with natural language or assets, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating high-quality, editable graphic compositions that are both visually appealing and accessible to beginners, as existing tools struggle with user-supplied assets and professional standards.

Method: The framework uses an RGBA multimodal model to produce a JSON specification for design layers and a conditional background model to synthesize coherent backgrounds, creating multi-layer editable compositions.

Result: CreatiPoster surpasses existing open-source and commercial systems in automated benchmarks for graphic design generation and includes a release of 100,000 copyright-free designs.

Conclusion: CreatiPoster advances AI-assisted graphic design by enhancing functionality across editing, responsive resizing, multilingual adaptations, and animated graphics, while democratizing access through publicly available resources.

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

*Guimeng Liu,Milad Abdollahzadeh,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of current ZSGM methods for adapting pre-trained generators to new domains using text guidance by analyzing offset misalignment in CLIP embeddings and introducing the AIR method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of generated images in zero-shot generative model adaptation by investigating and addressing offset misalignment in the CLIP embedding space.

Method: Conduct an empirical study on offset misalignment in CLIP embeddings and introduce Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR) as a novel approach to refine image offsets and address quality degradation issues.

Result: Empirical findings indicate offset misalignment is correlated with concept distance, while the proposed AIR method delivers state-of-the-art performance in image quality across 26 experimental setups.

Conclusion: The study enhances the understanding of offset misalignment in ZSGM and provides a practical solution with AIR, leading to improved target domain image quality.

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

*Jiancheng Huang,Gengwei Zhang,Zequn Jie,Siyu Jiao,Yinlong Qian,Ling Chen,Yunchao Wei,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M4V introduces a novel framework for efficient text-to-video generation, significantly reducing computational complexity and improving video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing potential of text-to-video generation demands solving computational challenges for practical applications, especially when modeling spatiotemporal sequences efficiently.

Method: The paper proposes M4V, featuring a Multi-Modal Diffusion Mamba block for integrating multi-modal inputs and reducing computational operations. It introduces a token re-composition design for spatiotemporal modeling and a reward learning strategy for long-context visual quality enhancement.

Result: M4V cut computational costs by 45% compared to attention-based alternatives for high-resolution videos and achieved superior video quality in experiments on text-to-video benchmarks.

Conclusion: M4V proves its strength as an efficient and high-quality solution for text-to-video generation, pushing forward capabilities in the field while reducing computational limitations.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method for in-context image editing using annotated video data, proposing a novel framework and benchmark for multi-turn editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing in-context image editing methods rely on task-specific pipelines and expert curated data; the paper explores whether learning directly from videos can improve scalability and effectiveness.

Method: The authors developed a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on annotated video data using three proxy tasks, combined with a scalable approach for multimodal sequence annotation.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in two multi-turn image editing benchmarks and demonstrates robust multi-concept editing and story generation capabilities.

Conclusion: Learning in-context image editing directly from video data is feasible and effective, opening new avenues for scalable and versatile editing applications.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

*Yuanhui Huang,Weiliang Chen,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpectralAR, a novel autoregressive visual generation framework that tokenizes images into spectral components, enabling causal and efficient image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of applying autoregressive visual generation to inherently parallel image data, which contradicts causal modeling.

Method: The proposed method, SpectralAR, uses Nested Spectral Tokenization to transform images into ordered spectral tokens and generates images autoregressively from coarse to fine frequency details.

Result: SpectralAR achieves high-quality image generation with 3.02 gFID on ImageNet-1K using only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

Conclusion: SpectralAR aligns autoregressive modeling with causal sequence generation in vision while maintaining efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new challenge in image generation, focusing on creating knowledge images that integrate world knowledge into clear visuals. It introduces a benchmark, MMMG, for evaluation and highlights the difficulty of the task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the challenge of generating images that convey structured knowledge visually, which plays an essential role in human learning processes.

Method: The authors create MMMG, a benchmark comprising expert-validated image-prompt pairs and introduce MMMG-Score, a metric evaluating factual accuracy and visual clarity of generated images.

Result: Evaluating 16 advanced text-to-image models shows significant flaws in reasoning, with the best model scoring only 50.20 on the MMMG-Score. They also propose a baseline model (FLUX-Reason) achieving 34.45.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the difficulty in generating knowledge images and aim to encourage progress in developing models capable of such multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

*Qizhe Zhang,Mengzhen Liu,Lichen Li,Ming Lu,Yuan Zhang,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CDPruner, a novel visual token pruning method that uses a determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize conditional diversity, significantly reducing computational costs in MLLMs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high inference cost in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) caused by the excessive number of visual tokens, which current approaches fail to optimize effectively due to retaining duplicates or ignoring instruction relevance.

Method: The authors propose CDPruner, a training-free and model-agnostic token pruning approach that uses a determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of retained tokens, better representing input images and adhering to user instructions.

Result: CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art results across vision-language benchmarks, reducing FLOPs by 95% and CUDA latency by 78% in the LLaVA model, while maintaining 94% of the original accuracy.

Conclusion: By maximizing conditional diversity, CDPruner effectively mitigates high inference costs in MLLMs without significantly compromising accuracy, making it a highly efficient and generalizable solution applicable to various MLLMs.

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available
at https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GenWorld, a realistic and high-quality simulation dataset for detecting AI-generated videos and proposes a new detection model, SpannDetector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in AI-generated video technology undermines trust in real-world information, creating a need for robust detection systems that are currently hindered by inadequate datasets.

Method: The researchers developed GenWorld, a dataset featuring realistic, high-quality, and diverse AI-generated videos, and proposed SpannDetector, a detection model leveraging multi-view consistency for improved detection.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SpannDetector outperforms existing methods in detecting high-quality AI-generated videos and exposes the shortcomings of current approaches.

Conclusion: The GenWorld dataset and SpannDetector model represent significant advancements in detecting AI-generated videos, addressing both dataset quality and detection accuracy issues.

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

*Sicheng Zuo,Wenzhao Zheng,Xiaoyong Han,Longchao Yang,Yong Pan,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for efficient 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving systems, overcoming inefficiencies in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D occupancy prediction methods are inefficient due to reliance on dense voxel-based representations or sparse Gaussians with limited geometric adaptability.

Method: The paper introduces a probabilistic superquadric mixture model and QuadricFormer, leveraging superquadrics as primitives for efficient 3D scene representation and advanced modeling techniques like pruning-and-splitting.

Result: QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance and higher modeling efficiency, demonstrated through experiments on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: Using superquadrics provides a geometrically expressive and efficient solution for 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving, addressing inefficiencies in traditional approaches.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

*Donghoon Ahn,Jiwon Kang,Sanghyun Lee,Minjae Kim,Jaewon Min,Wooseok Jang,Saungwu Lee,Sayak Paul,Susung Hong,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'HeadHunter,' a framework for head-level attention perturbation in diffusion models to enhance generation quality and provide style-specific guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of principled methods for applying attention perturbations in diffusion models, especially in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures, for fine-grained control over generated outputs.

Method: They analyze the attention heads of DiT architectures and identify their roles in visual attributes. Using this insight, they propose 'HeadHunter' for selective attention perturbation and introduce 'SoftPAG' for continuous adjustment of perturbation strength.

Result: Their method mitigates oversmoothing, enables style-specific control, and achieves superior quality enhancement performance in modern DiT-based models like Stable Diffusion 3.

Conclusion: This work uncovers interpretable specialization within attention layers, provides head-level perturbation analysis, and offers practical strategies for improving quality and customizability in diffusion model outputs.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

*Junqi You,Chieh Hubert Lin,Weijie Lyu,Zhengbo Zhang,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces InstaInpaint, a fast and efficient 3D scene inpainting method that completes in 0.4 seconds using a reference-based feed-forward framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and impracticality of current 3D scene inpainting methods for real-time applications, which rely on computationally intensive optimization.

Method: The authors propose InstaInpaint, a feed-forward framework incorporating self-supervised masked-finetuning training for their custom large reconstruction model (LRM) on a large dataset.

Result: InstaInpaint achieves a 1000x speed improvement over prior methods while maintaining top-tier performance on two benchmarks. It also generalizes well to other applications, such as object insertion and multi-region inpainting.

Conclusion: InstaInpaint is a real-time capable and state-of-the-art solution for 3D scene inpainting with flexibility and high effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

### [188] [SceneCompleter: Dense 3D Scene Completion for Generative Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10981)
*Weiliang Chen,Jiayi Bi,Yuanhui Huang,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneCompleter, a framework for 3D-consistent novel view synthesis, addressing limitations of existing 2D-to-3D generative methods using dense 3D scene completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for novel view synthesis face difficulties in inferring 3D structure from RGB data, often leading to distorted geometry and smooth surfaces. The paper seeks to address this by improving 3D consistency and scene understanding.

Method: The authors propose SceneCompleter, which consists of a dual-stream diffusion model to synthesize in RGBD space and a scene embedder to enhance scene understanding. These elements jointly focus on synthesizing visually coherent and 3D-consistent scenes.

Result: SceneCompleter significantly improves 3D structure consistency and visual coherence in novel view synthesis across various datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The novel 3D-consistent SceneCompleter framework effectively resolves limitations of typical NVS generative models by balancing structural and textural information, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: The paper explores how sparse matrix reordering affects sparse matrix-vector multiplication performance on multicore CPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse matrix-vector multiplication often suffers from inefficiency due to irregular data patterns and load imbalance. Reordering methods can potentially mitigate these issues and enhance computational performance.

Method: The authors tested various sparse matrix reordering strategies across multiple multicore CPU platforms, analyzing their impact on performance during sequential and parallel execution.

Result: The study found performance improvements through reordering techniques, with variation based on CPU platforms and reordering strategies.

Conclusion: Sparse matrix reordering is effective in optimizing performance, but its impact varies depending on the platform and strategy employed.

Abstract: This work evaluates the impact of sparse matrix reordering on the performance
of sparse matrix-vector multiplication across different multicore CPU
platforms. Reordering can significantly enhance performance by optimizing the
non-zero element patterns to reduce total data movement and improve the
load-balancing. We examine how these gains vary over different CPUs for
different reordering strategies, focusing on both sequential and parallel
execution. We address multiple aspects, including appropriate measurement
methodology, comparison across different kinds of reordering strategies,
consistency across machines, and impact of load imbalance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework to optimize the distribution and replication of software components across diverse hardware setups for resilience, using a model-finding algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of making complex systems resilient to hardware and software failures by intelligently spreading software components.

Method: An algorithm based on state-space exploration, incorporating optimizations like a quotient reduction with a novel equivalence relation, is proposed to determine initial resilient configurations and reconfiguration policies.

Result: Experimental results show the successful application of the framework on an autonomous driving system model.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances the resilience of complex systems under failures, demonstrating its validity through experimental evaluation.

Abstract: This paper presents a powerful automated framework for making complex systems
resilient under failures, by optimized adaptive distribution and replication of
interdependent software components across heterogeneous hardware components
with widely varying capabilities. A configuration specifies how software is
distributed and replicated: which software components to run on each computer,
which software components to replicate, which replication protocols to use,
etc. We present an algorithm that, given a system model and resilience
requirements, (1) determines initial configurations of the system that are
resilient, and (2) generates a reconfiguration policy that determines
reconfiguration actions to execute in response to failures and recoveries. This
model-finding algorithm is based on state-space exploration and incorporates
powerful optimizations, including a quotient reduction based on a novel
equivalence relation between states. We present experimental results from
successfully applying a prototype implementation of our framework to a model of

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in CUDA code translation to other platforms, proposing a novel framework leveraging AI and graph-based data augmentation for training LLMs, and introduces a new evaluation benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUDA's dominance in parallel computing and the need for performance portability drive efforts to overcome challenges in translating CUDA code to other hardware platforms.

Method: The proposed framework uses AI compiler technology, automatic optimization, and graph-based data augmentation to generate high-performance CUDA-platform code pairs. It also introduces HPCTransEval, a benchmark for LLM evaluation.

Result: Experiments using CUDA-to-CPU transpilation show significant improvements in translation quality with the framework, emphasizing LLMs' potential for compatibility issues.

Conclusion: Enhanced data preparation and evaluation methods can effectively improve CUDA code compatibility across platforms, leveraging LLMs to address critical gaps.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of balancing energy efficiency and model accuracy in Federated Learning, especially in the presence of device and data heterogeneity, while exploring sustainable AI through energy budgets.

Method: FedJoule employs a novel bi-level Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach leveraging Shapley values and energy-time prediction models for efficient client selection.

Result: FedJoule outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, providing improvements of 15% in accuracy and 48% in training time across diverse setups, including non-IID data distributions.

Conclusion: FedJoule demonstrates its capability to achieve an effective trade-off between energy consumption and performance, making it a promising method for Federated Learning in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, optimizing both
energy efficiency and model accuracy remains a challenge, given device and data
heterogeneity. Further, sustainable AI through a global energy budget for FL
has not been explored. We propose a novel optimization problem for client
selection in FL that maximizes the model accuracy within an overall energy
limit and reduces training time. We solve this with a unique bi-level ILP
formulation that leverages approximate Shapley values and energy-time
prediction models to efficiently solve this. Our FedJoule framework achieves
superior training accuracies compared to SOTA and simple baselines for diverse
energy budgets, non-IID distributions, and realistic experiment configurations,
performing 15% and 48% better on accuracy and time, respectively. The results
highlight the effectiveness of our method in achieving a viable trade-off
between energy usage and performance in FL environments.

*Joanna Georgiou,Moysis Symeonides,George Pallis,Marios D. Dikaiakos*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces an auto-benchmarking framework to efficiently analyze multi-tenancy performance in Edge Computing environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing multi-tenancy in Edge Computing raises concerns about security, resource contention, performance degradation, and energy efficiency, requiring a structured approach for thorough analysis.

Method: The authors developed an auto-benchmarking framework with a monitoring stack, integrating diverse benchmarking workloads, including analytics, databases, machine learning, and stress tests. They also conducted case-driven analyses across various hardware configurations.

Result: The study provides insights into the performance impact of multi-tenancy on Edge environments involving a range of hardware setups and workloads.

Conclusion: The proposed auto-benchmarking framework simplifies performance analysis in multi-tenant Edge settings and offers publicly available tools and containerized workloads to encourage further exploration.

Abstract: Edge Computing emerges as a promising alternative of Cloud Computing, with
scalable compute resources and services deployed in the path between IoT
devices and Cloud. Since virtualization techniques can be applied on Edge
compute nodes, administrators can share their Edge infrastructures among
multiple users, providing the so-called multi-tenancy. Even though
multi-tenancy is unavoidable, it raises concerns about security and performance
degradation due to resource contention in Edge Computing. For that,
administrators need to deploy services with non-antagonizing profiles and
explore workload co-location scenarios to enhance performance and energy
consumption. Achieving this, however, requires extensive configuration,
deployment, iterative testing, and analysis, an effort-intensive and
time-consuming process. To address this challenge, we introduce an
auto-benchmarking framework designed to streamline the analysis of
multi-tenancy performance in Edge environments. Our framework includes a
built-in monitoring stack and integrates with widely used benchmarking
workloads, such as streaming analytics, database operations, machine learning
applications, and component-based stress testing. We perform a case-driven
analysis and provide valuable insights into the impact of multi-tenancy on Edge
environments with different hardware configurations and diverse workloads.
Finally, the implementation of our framework, along with the containerized
workloads used for experimentation, is publicly available.

*Hongbin Zhang,Taosheng Wei,Zhenyi Zheng,Jiangsu Du,Zhiguang Chen,Yutong Lu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes TD-Pipe, a temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism architecture, to enhance throughput in LLM inference by addressing pipeline workload imbalances and reducing pipeline bubbles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the significant performance reduction in pipeline parallelism caused by imbalanced workloads and complex data dependencies during LLM inference phases.

Method: The authors propose a temporally-disaggregated pipeline architecture with solutions such as hierarchy-controller structure for scheduling, AI-based greedy prefill for optimizing memory usage, inter-batch work stealing to balance workloads, and spatial-temporal intensity comparison for optimal phase switching.

Result: TD-Pipe achieves up to 1.91x and 2.73x higher throughput compared to existing tensor and pipeline parallel approaches, respectively, in experiments using GPU nodes with PCIe interconnection.

Conclusion: TD-Pipe effectively mitigates pipeline inefficiencies, thereby significantly enhancing performance in LLM inference with minimal communication overhead.

Abstract: As the model size continuously increases, pipeline parallelism shows great
promise in throughput-oriented LLM inference due to its low demand on
communications. However, imbalanced pipeline workloads and complex data
dependencies in the prefill and decode phases result in massive pipeline
bubbles and further severe performance reduction. To better exploit the
pipeline parallelism for high-throughput LLM inference, we propose TD-Pipe,
with the key idea lies in the temporally-disaggregated pipeline parallelism
architecture. Specifically, this architecture disaggregates the prefill and
decode phases in the temporal dimension, so as to eliminate pipeline bubbles
caused by the phase switching. TD-Pipe identifies potential issues of
exploiting the novel architecture and provides solutions. First, a
hierarchy-controller structure is used to better coordinate devices in pipeline
parallelism by decoupling the scheduling from execution. Second, the AI-based
greedy prefill approach aggressively performs more prefills by predicting the
output length and simulating the memory usage. Third, the inter-batch work
stealing approach dynamically balances decode phase workloads between different
batches to reduce bubbles. Forth, the spatial-temporal intensity comparison
approach determines the optimal switch from decode to prefill by comparing the
performance drop from reduced computational intensity with that from phase
switching bubbles. Extensive experiments show that TD-Pipe effectively
increases the throughput of LLM inference by up to 1.91x over the existing
tensor parallel approach and 2.73x over the existing pipeline parallel approach
on GPU nodes with only PCIe interconnection.

Motivation: Current digital twin approaches face challenges balancing real-time responsiveness and heavy computational demands, particularly due to the limitations of cloud and edge-based solutions.

Method: The HP2C-DT architecture dynamically assigns computational tasks to edge, cloud, and HPC resources based on urgency and needs, and introduces a practical framework using COMPSs for workload distribution.

Result: Testing in a power grid scenario showed reduced communication bandwidth by an order of magnitude, improved response times by up to 2x, and strong scaling for compute-intensive workflows across diverse resources.

Conclusion: Integrating HPC into digital twin workflows can overcome traditional constraints, enabling smarter, faster, and more robust handling of complex real-world systems.

Abstract: Digital twins are transforming the way we monitor, analyze, and control
physical systems, but designing architectures that balance real-time
responsiveness with heavy computational demands remains a challenge.
Cloud-based solutions often struggle with latency and resource constraints,
while edge-based approaches lack the processing power for complex simulations
and data-driven optimizations.
  To address this problem, we propose the High-Precision High-Performance
Computer-enabled Digital Twin (HP2C-DT) reference architecture, which
integrates High-Performance Computing (HPC) into the computing continuum.
Unlike traditional setups that use HPC only for offline simulations, HP2C-DT
makes it an active part of digital twin workflows, dynamically assigning tasks
to edge, cloud, or HPC resources based on urgency and computational needs.
  Furthermore, to bridge the gap between theory and practice, we introduce the
HP2C-DT framework, a working implementation that uses COMPSs for seamless
workload distribution across diverse infrastructures. We test it in a power
grid use case, showing how it reduces communication bandwidth by an order of
magnitude through edge-side data aggregation, improves response times by up to
2x via dynamic offloading, and maintains near-ideal strong scaling for
compute-intensive workflows across a practical range of resources. These
results demonstrate how an HPC-driven approach can push digital twins beyond
their current limitations, making them smarter, faster, and more capable of
handling real-world complexity.

addresses these limitations and highlights critical advancements needed to

Furthermore, we conduct an empirical evaluation of 5G network infrastructure in

TL;DR: This paper focuses on addressing communication inefficiencies in decentralized federated learning by proposing a graph-based gossiping mechanism optimized for real-world setups, improving bandwidth and transfer time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the inefficiencies in communication within decentralized federated learning due to increased message exchanges in large-scale scenarios and the lack of realistic evaluations in existing studies.

Method: A graph-based gossiping mechanism is proposed, utilizing minimum spanning tree and graph coloring techniques to optimize network structures and communication scheduling in real-world distributed setups.

Result: The experimental results reveal improved network communication, showing reductions in bandwidth and transfer times by up to 8 and 4.4 times respectively compared to naive flooding broadcasting methods.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism effectively enhances communication efficiency in decentralized learning setups, proving compatibility across different network settings and overcoming limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving technique for
collaborative model training across heterogeneously distributed silos. Yet, its
reliance on a single central server introduces potential bottlenecks and risks
of single-point failure. Decentralizing the server, often referred to as
decentralized learning, addresses this problem by distributing the server role
across nodes within the network. One drawback regarding this pure
decentralization is it introduces communication inefficiencies, which arise
from increased message exchanges in large-scale setups. However, existing
proposed solutions often fail to simulate the real-world distributed and
decentralized environment in their experiments, leading to unreliable
performance evaluations and limited applicability in practice. Recognizing the
lack from prior works, this work investigates the correlation between model
size and network latency, a critical factor in optimizing decentralized
learning communication. We propose a graph-based gossiping mechanism, where
specifically, minimum spanning tree and graph coloring are used to optimize
network structure and scheduling for efficient communication across various
network topologies and message capacities. Our approach configures and manages
subnetworks on real physical routers and devices and closely models real-world
distributed setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves communication, compatible with different topologies and
data sizes, reducing bandwidth and transfer time by up to circa 8 and 4.4
times, respectively, compared to naive flooding broadcasting methods.

### [201] [The Impact of Partial Computations on the Red-Blue Pebble Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10854)
*Pál András Papp,Aleksandros Sobczyk,A. N. Yzelman*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper extends the red-blue pebble game to include partial computation steps, enabling more realistic cost modeling for certain computational settings while showing the approach’s complexity and NP-hardness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original red-blue pebble game assumes simultaneous availability of inputs in fast memory, but in real-world settings, inputs can often be aggregated incrementally into outputs, prompting the need for a more realistic cost model.

Method: The authors define the partial-computing red-blue pebble game (PRBP), analyze its properties and behaviors compared to the original RBP, and adapt tools like $S$-partitions for this model. Computational hardness and lower bounds are also assessed.

Result: Partial computations can significantly reduce the I/O costs in certain computational tasks, with potential reductions by a linear factor. However, deciding or approximating the optimal cost remains NP-hard.

Conclusion: The PRBP refines the theoretical framework for modeling computation costs in aggregation scenarios, providing new insights but highlighting intrinsic computational complexity.

Abstract: We study an extension of the well-known red-blue pebble game (RBP) with
partial computation steps, inspired by the recent work of Sobczyk. While the
original RBP assumes that we need to have all the inputs of an operation in
fast memory at the same time, in many concrete computations, the inputs can be
aggregated one by one into the final output value. These partial computation
steps can enable pebbling strategies with much smaller I/O cost, and in
settings where such a step-by-step aggregation is possible, this extended
red-blue pebble game offers a much more realistic cost model.
  We establish the fundamental properties of this partial-computing red-blue
pebble game (PRBP), and compare it to the original RBP. We begin with some
simple examples where allowing partial computations can decrease the optimal
I/O cost. It is also shown that the cost can decrease by up to a linear factor
this way, but in general, it is NP-hard to decide whether partial computations
allow for a smaller cost in a specific DAG. We then discuss how $S$-partitions,
a crucial tool for deriving I/O lower bounds in RBP, can be adapted to the PRBP
model. These new tools are then used to establish lower bounds on the I/O cost
of some prominent computational tasks. Finally, we also adapt a hardness result
from RBP, showing that the optimum cost is still NP-hard to approximate in PRBP
to any reasonable factor.

*Waylon Luo,Jiapeng Zhao,Tong Zhan,Qiang Guan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges in scaling quantum computations and introduces a simulation tool for parallel execution on networked quantum processors, comparing four scheduling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current quantum systems, including low qubit counts, high error rates, and system noise, and optimize resource allocation for large quantum computations.

Method: A simulation tool that facilitates distributed scheduling and parallel execution of large quantum circuits, combined with an evaluation of four scheduling methods, including reinforcement learning.

Result: The simulation tool enables efficient workload distribution, testing four approaches by metrics like runtime, fidelity, and communication cost, revealing trade-offs among them.

Conclusion: Noise-aware, parallel scheduling can boost the performance of distributed quantum systems, offering insights for improving scalability and efficiency in quantum infrastructures.

Abstract: Present-day quantum systems face critical bottlenecks, including limited
qubit counts, brief coherence intervals, and high susceptibility to errors-all
of which obstruct the execution of large and complex circuits. The advancement
of quantum algorithms has outpaced the capabilities of existing quantum
hardware, making it difficult to scale computations effectively. Additionally,
inconsistencies in hardware performance and pervasive quantum noise undermine
system stability and computational accuracy. To optimize quantum workloads
under these constraints, strategic approaches to task scheduling and resource
coordination are essential. These methods must aim to accelerate processing,
retain operational fidelity, and reduce the communication burden inherent to
distributed setups. One of the persistent challenges in this domain is how to
efficiently divide and execute large circuits across multiple quantum
processors (QPUs), especially in error-prone environments. In response, we
introduce a simulation-based tool that supports distributed scheduling and
concurrent execution of quantum jobs on networked QPUs connected via real-time
classical channels. The tool models circuit decomposition for workloads that
surpass individual QPU limits, allowing for parallel execution through
inter-processor communication. Using this simulation environment, we compare
four distinct scheduling techniques-among them, a model informed by
reinforcement learning. These strategies are evaluated across multiple metrics,
including runtime efficiency, fidelity preservation, and communication costs.
Our analysis underscores the trade-offs inherent in each approach and
highlights how parallelized, noise-aware scheduling can meaningfully improve
computational throughput in distributed quantum infrastructures.

### [203] [Leveraging Pre-Trained Models for Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning under Adaptive Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09999)
*Yukun Chen,Zihuan Qiu,Fanman Meng,Hongliang Li,Linfeng Xu,Qingbo Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel MCIL method leveraging multimodal pre-trained models for effective integration of vision, audio, and text, tackling catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges including catastrophic forgetting and effectively integrating vision, audio, and text modalities in MCIL.

Method: Introduces the MIFE structure for incremental fine-tuning, an AAVFM for adaptive feature fusion, and a new multimodal contrastive training loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances feature discriminability while addressing challenges in MCIL, marked by improved evaluation metrics and cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

### [204] [NOCL: Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM for Graph Tasks without Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10014)
*Wei Li,Mengcheng Lan,Jiaxing Xu,Yiping Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM (NOCL), utilizing natural language descriptions for graph elements to enhance zero-shot and supervised graph-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Graph Neural Networks rely heavily on supervised learning and struggle in label-scarce scenarios, while Large Language Models face challenges in applying their capabilities to graph tasks due to token length restrictions and limitations tied to textual graphs.

Method: NOCL converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured natural language descriptions and encodes them into compact semantic embeddings, reducing token lengths significantly. It also provides a unified query format for various graph tasks using graph representation descriptors.

Result: NOCL demonstrates competitive performance in supervised settings compared to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNNs, and exhibits superior generalization in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap between graph learning and LLMs by introducing effective solutions for tasks involving both textual and non-textual graphs, paving the way for Graph Foundation Models.

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

### [205] [Improving the performance of optical inverse design of multilayer thin films using CNN-LSTM tandem neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10044)
*Uijun Jung,Deokho Jang,Sungchul Kim,Jungho Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using deep learning, specifically tandem neural networks (TNNs), to accurately predict the thickness and optical properties of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films, addressing limitations in traditional inverse design methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in optical inverse design of thin films, where traditional methods require extensive simulations and are time-consuming.

Method: The authors utilize a tandem neural network (TNN) with various configurations (MLP, CNN, and LSTM), examining their performance in predicting transmission spectra from thin-film thicknesses.

Result: An LSTM-LSTM-based TNN achieved the highest accuracy, but required the longest training time. A CNN-LSTM-based TNN was identified as the optimal configuration for balancing accuracy and training speed.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based TNNs, particularly the CNN-LSTM configuration, are effective and efficient tools for the inverse design of optical properties in multilayer thin films.

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

*Shangpin Peng,Weinong Wang,Zhuotao Tian,Senqiao Yang,Xing Wu,Haotian Xu,Chengquan Zhang,Takashi Isobe,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Omni-DPO optimizes reinforcement learning by considering preference quality and model performance, significantly outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO methods in RLHF overlook variations in preference pair quality and learning utility, resulting in inefficient data use and subpar performance.

Method: Omni-DPO introduces an adaptive sample weighting framework based on preference pair quality and the model's training dynamics.

Result: Omni-DPO excels in textual understanding and mathematical reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming leading benchmarks and models, such as Claude 3 Opus.

Conclusion: Omni-DPO leverages adaptive optimization for better data utilization, delivering superior performance and robustness across diverse reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

*Chen-Chia Chang,Wan-Hsuan Lin,Yikang Shen,Yiran Chen,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LaMAGIC2, an enhanced framework for generating analog topologies using language models, improving numeric precision, token length efficiency, and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing analog topologies is challenging due to modern applications demanding highly customized solutions, requiring significant manual engineering efforts.

Method: The authors propose a new canonical formulation called SFCI for language model-based analog topology generation, addressing shortcomings in token length efficiency and numeric precision sensitivity.

Result: LaMAGIC2 shows 34% higher success rates under tight tolerances and achieves 10X lower MSEs compared to previous methods. It also has better transferability, improving performance by up to 58.5% for complex circuits.

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2 is a robust and efficient framework for analog topology generation, outperforming prior methods in precision and adaptability.

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

### [208] [Textual Bayes: Quantifying Uncertainty in LLM-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10060)
*Brendan Leigh Ross,Noël Vouitsis,Atiyeh Ashari Ghomi,Rasa Hosseinzadeh,Ji Xin,Zhaoyan Liu,Yi Sui,Shiyi Hou,Kin Kwan Leung,Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem,Jesse C. Cresswell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) by interpreting prompts as parameters, introducing a novel MCMC algorithm for inference, and showing improved predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately quantifying uncertainty in large language models is essential for their reliable application in high-stakes domains, especially given their black-box nature and sensitivity to manual prompt tuning.

Method: The paper adopts a Bayesian approach by treating prompts as textual parameters of a statistical model, introducing Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for inference, compatible even with closed-source LLMs.

Result: The proposed MHLP method improves predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification across multiple LLM benchmarks and tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating Bayesian methods can enhance the reliability and calibration of LLM-based systems, demonstrating a promising path for integrating statistical principles into modern AI models.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

### [209] [Optimizing Latent Dimension Allocation in Hierarchical VAEs: Balancing Attenuation and Information Retention for OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10089)
*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information theory-based framework to optimize latent dimension allocation in hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the arbitrary allocation of latent dimensions in HVAEs, which results in ineffective representations or posterior collapse, thus improving their robustness for OOD detection in safety-critical machine learning tasks.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework that uses information theory to determine the optimal latent dimension allocation ratio, balancing information loss and representational attenuation, and they prove the existence of an optimal allocation ratio.

Result: The optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ improves OOD detection performance across various datasets and HVAE architectures, outperforming baseline configurations.

Conclusion: Optimizing latent structure in HVAEs using the proposed theoretical framework enhances their capability for robust OOD detection, providing practical design guidelines for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

*Bingshan Hu,Zheng He,Danica J. Sutherland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel class of kernelized bandit algorithms, called GP-Generic, involving exploration distributions and achieving competitive regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency and extend the capabilities of kernelized bandit algorithms for unknown reward functions within RKHS.

Method: The methodology involves designing GP-Generic algorithms based on exploration distributions, which include both UCB-based approaches and randomized algorithms.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve $	ilde{O}(\\gamma_T\\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds, matching existing benchmarks and demonstrating improved practical performance through randomization.

Conclusion: Randomized approaches within GP-Generic algorithms enable versatile and efficient solutions, achieving both theoretical and practical improvements in kernelized bandit problems.

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-phase deep autoencoder system for unsupervised clustering of MNIST digits, integrating reconstruction error and KMeans clustering loss for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance unsupervised clustering of handwritten digits by improving latent representation and clustering performance simultaneously.

Method: A two-phase deep autoencoder architecture: phase one minimizes reconstruction loss for effective latent representation, while phase two blends reconstruction error with KMeans clustering loss using a joint distance-based objective.

Result: The approach yields superior clustering results using metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, NMI, and ARI. t-SNE visualizations show clear digit clusters.

Conclusion: The framework achieves a balance between reconstruction accuracy and cluster purity, providing scalable and interpretable solutions for large-scale image clustering.

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

*Ahmed Elbakary,Chaouki Ben Issaid,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient federated learning method that enhances client personalization using dynamic graph-based collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of personalization, communication efficiency, and preventing negative collaboration among clients in federated multi-task learning.

Method: The proposed method uses feature anchors for efficient communication, a graph-based regularization for dynamic client collaboration, and a community detection method to form homogeneous client groups for positive knowledge transfer.

Result: Experiments on two heterogeneous datasets show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, communication efficiency, and client fairness.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances personalization, ensures efficient collaboration, and achieves fairness while outperforming existing techniques in federated multi-task learning.

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating complex natural objects, like clouds, is computationally expensive, restricting scalability. The paper aims to address these limitations by proposing an efficient computational model.

Method: The study leverages score-based diffusion through annealed Langevin dynamics to ensure non-negative outputs during iterative scene generation and analysis.

Result: The model is capable of generating high-quality 3D volumetric clouds that align with cloud physics trends and seem realistic to experts.

Conclusion: NnD represents a significant advancement in generating scalable, physically consistent simulations of complex natural phenomena like clouds, reducing computational costs while maintaining realism.

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRAIL, a benchmarking framework for evaluating graph-based Active Learning (AL) in dynamic environments with novel metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based AL methods inadequately address dynamic settings and user-centric considerations, necessitating better evaluation mechanisms.

Method: GRAIL is a benchmarking framework that incorporates metrics for sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden in dynamic, real-world scenarios.

Result: Experiments on dynamic datasets illustrate trade-offs in prediction performance and user burden, uncovering limitations in current AL strategies.

Conclusion: GRAIL fosters a balance between node importance, query diversity, and network topology, advancing the evaluation of graph-based AL methods in real-world applications.

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: The study addresses decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandit problems under severe feedback limitations, where players know only their rewards and arm capacities are unknown. Authors propose A-CAPELLA algorithm, achieving efficient outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge in decentralized systems where players lack sensing abilities to coordinate effectively, introducing unknown capacities of arms as a generalized complexity.

Method: The authors propose A-CAPELLA, employing a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol for synchronized elimination and capacity estimation via structured collision patterns.

Result: A-CAPELLA achieves logarithmic regret, supporting efficient learning and coordination in decentralized no-sensing MMAB scenarios with unknown capacities.

Conclusion: The research successfully demonstrates a provably efficient algorithm to tackle decentralized MMAB problems, expanding theoretical understanding and offering practical solutions.

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably

*Arnaud Fickinger,Abderrahim Bendahi,Stuart Russell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on offline domain randomization (ODR), a training method designed to reduce performance gaps between simulation and real-world environments for reinforcement-learning agents, by fitting simulator parameters to offline real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional domain randomization often overlooks existing offline data from real systems, which could better inform training and reduce the sim-to-real performance gap for reinforcement-learning models.

Method: The authors formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood estimation problem and introduce E-DROPO, a variant of an existing ODR method, enhanced with an entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse. They also provide theoretical proofs supporting ODR's consistency and error reduction benefits.

Result: They demonstrate that ODR achieves sim-to-real error reductions up to a factor of O(M) compared to traditional methods, and E-DROPO improves robustness and zero-shot transfer in practice.

Conclusion: The paper establishes theoretical foundations for ODR, proving it can converge to true dynamics and significantly reduce sim-to-real errors when offline data is utilized effectively with enhanced algorithms like E-DROPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

### [217] [Survival Analysis as Imprecise Classification with Trainable Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10140)
*Andrei V. Konstantinov,Vlada A. Efremenko,Lev V. Utkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces three novel survival models (iSurvM, iSurvQ, iSurvJ) utilizing imprecise probability theory and attention mechanisms to handle censored data, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the limitations of traditional survival analysis models, such as the Beran estimator, in handling complex and heavily censored data.

Method: Three novel models are introduced incorporating imprecise probability theory and attention mechanisms, using interval-valued probability distributions and kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson regression with attention weights.

Result: Experiments show the proposed models, particularly iSurvJ, outperform traditional methods like the Beran estimator in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The novel models provide a significant improvement in survival analysis under complex and censored data conditions, with publicly available code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

### [218] [Self-Predictive Representations for Combinatorial Generalization in Behavioral Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10137)
*Daniel Lawson,Adriana Hugessen,Charlotte Cloutier,Glen Berseth,Khimya Khetarpal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BYOL-γ augmented GCBC, a method to improve goal-conditioned behavior cloning through successor representations without contrastive samples or temporal-difference learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral cloning struggles to generalize to novel state-goal pairs due to a lack of temporal consistency in state representations.

Method: The paper proposes BYOL-γ, which leverages a representation learning objective to approximate successor representations without relying on contrastive samples or TD learning.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates competitive performance across tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Conclusion: BYOL-γ enhances representation learning for generalization in goal-conditioned tasks, presenting a simpler and effective approach to successor representations.

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

### [219] [Probabilistic Variational Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10159)
*Minoh Jeong,Seonho Kim,Alfred Hero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL), a new probabilistic framework for contrastive learning that improves accuracy, avoids dimensional collapse, and provides meaningful uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic embeddings in contrastive learning, while effective, lack a formal way to quantify uncertainty. This limitation hinders interpretability and potential robustness of these methods.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework called Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL) which optimizes the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). It interprets InfoNCE as a surrogate reconstruction term and employs a KL divergence regularizer. The posterior is modeled as a projected normal distribution, enabling probabilistic embeddings.

Result: VCL mitigates dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and matches or surpasses deterministic baselines in classification tasks while also introducing meaningful uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: VCL provides a probabilistic foundation for contrastive learning, improving on both performance and interpretability, and establishes itself as a promising approach for contrastive methods.

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

*Mohammad Taufeeque,Aaron David Tucker,Adam Gleave,Adrià Garriga-Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how a convolutional RNN trained using model-free reinforcement learning solves Sokoban puzzles, revealing mechanisms similar to bidirectional search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how a neural network trained through reinforcement learning can utilize test-time compute effectively for solving complex sequential problems.

Method: The authors reverse-engineer the trained network’s operations, analyzing state-action activations resembling a value function, and studying specialized kernels that manage path extensions forward and backward.

Result: The network implements mechanisms analogous to bidirectional search, including per-square directional plans and pruning strategies. It also employs a unique approach by considering each box independently and using layer-specific representations for deeper searches.

Conclusion: The studied neural network demonstrates that mechanisms learned via model-free training can be interpreted using classic algorithms like bidirectional search, adapting them in novel ways for specific tasks.

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

### [221] [Geometric Regularity in Deterministic Sampling of Diffusion-based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10177)
*Defang Chen,Zhenyu Zhou,Can Wang,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals a geometric regularity in diffusion-based generative models' sampling dynamics, where trajectories universally share a low-dimensional 'boomerang' shape. It introduces a time scheduling approach improving image generation efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance understanding and performance of deterministic sampling in diffusion-based generative models by uncovering underlying geometric patterns in sampling dynamics.

Method: The authors identified geometric trajectory regularities in sampling dynamics using deterministic methods and proposed a dynamic programming scheme to optimize the sampling time schedule with minimal modification to existing solvers.

Result: Trajectories in sampling dynamics were shown to have a consistent 'boomerang' shape in a low-dimensional subspace. The proposed optimization strategy improved image generation performance with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: The geometric regularity found in sampling dynamics of generative models facilitates the optimization of time scheduling, leading to superior practical performance in image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

### [222] [Meta-learning Representations for Learning from Multiple Annotators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10259)
*Atsutoshi Kumagai,Tomoharu Iwata,Taishi Nishiyama,Yasutoshi Ida,Yasuhiro Fujiwara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a meta-learning technique to learn from noisy labels provided by multiple annotators, leveraging related tasks to combat insufficient data and integrating the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for classifier adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised learning methods often struggle with noisy labels from multiple annotators, and insufficient annotated data exacerbates the challenge. The study aims to address this limitation by using data from related tasks.

Method: A neural network embeds data into a latent space, enabling task-specific classifier training while estimating annotator abilities. It uses an EM algorithm to adapt the classifier and backpropagates the loss through the EM steps to meta-learn the neural network.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates effectiveness on real-world datasets, handling both synthetic noise and genuine crowdsourced labels.

Conclusion: The study presents a robust approach for learning accurate classifiers from limited noisy annotations by integrating meta-learning and probabilistic modeling techniques.

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents a novel model combining physiological principles and neural networks for accurate heart rate estimation, achieving promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current heart rate monitoring tools that rely on population-based averages and lack interpretability and efficiency.

Method: A physiological-model-based neural network (PMB-NN) framework was developed, combining physiological constraints with neural network training to estimate heart rate from oxygen uptake data during activities like resting, cycling, and running.

Result: The PMB-NN model outperformed traditional physiological models (p=0.002), achieving a median R² score of 0.8 and RMSE of 8.3 bpm, with performance comparable to benchmark neural networks.

Conclusion: The PMB-NN framework offers a promising approach for personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily physical activities.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

*Tejaswi Kasarla,Max van Spengler,Pascal Mettes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Balanced Hyperbolic Learning to improve out-of-distribution recognition by leveraging hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings. Extensive evaluations show superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively filtering out out-of-distribution samples using deep learning, while enabling hierarchical generalization and improving classification accuracy.

Method: A hyperbolic class embedding algorithm is introduced, optimizing for both hierarchical distortion and balance between subhierarchies. These embeddings are then used as hyperbolic prototypes for classification and adapted for existing out-of-distribution scoring functions.

Result: Empirical evaluations on 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions demonstrate that the proposed hyperbolic embeddings outperform current out-of-distribution methods, other hyperbolic approaches, and state-of-the-art contrastive methods.

Conclusion: Hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings are highly effective for in- and out-of-distribution classification tasks, offering better generalization and discrimination capabilities than existing solutions.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

*Moïse Blanchard,Vineet Goyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Col-UCB, a collaborative algorithm for minimizing regret in grouped multi-armed bandit problems, and demonstrates its optimal regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced exploration costs between groups occur in multi-armed bandit problems with overlapping action sets. The goal is to create a collaborative strategy to share the exploration burden among groups.

Method: The authors propose Col-UCB, an algorithm that dynamically shares exploration data between groups to coordinate and minimize collaborative regret.

Result: Col-UCB achieves optimal minimax and instance-dependent collaborative regret bounds, adapting to the structure of shared action sets.

Conclusion: Dynamic collaboration via shared exploration reduces group imbalances, yielding significant improvements over independent learning approaches in grouped bandit scenarios.

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inadequacies of government-published AQI data, which do not capture localized pollution realities due to sparse sensor networks.

Method: Utilizing Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the AirDelhi dataset to improve AQI prediction accuracy in 1 km^2 neighborhoods.

Result: Achieved a 79% error reduction, quantified as 71.654 MSE, even on previously unobserved locations.

Conclusion: Spatio-temporal GNNs are effective in enhancing AQI predictions and reveal new insights about pollution patterns and spatial-temporal relationships.

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The

*Jikai Jin,Vasilis Syrgkanis,Sham Kakade,Hanlin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a causal representation framework to study language model capabilities, emphasizing the need to control confounding effects from base model variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in evaluating language model capabilities, including confounders and computational hurdles.

Method: They propose a causal representation learning framework to model benchmark performance as a linear transformation of latent factors, controlling for base model confounding.

Result: Through analysis of 1500 models across six benchmarks, they identify a three-node linear causal structure explaining performance variations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of controlling for base model variations to uncover causal relations among latent model capabilities, offering insights beyond static rankings.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the WBSAC algorithm, which improves sample efficiency in reinforcement learning for sparse-reward tasks through a novel exploration strategy using a pessimistic and optimistic actor combination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor sample efficiency in reinforcement learning, especially in sparse-reward continuous control tasks, which hampers performance and learning speed.

Method: The proposed method, WBSAC, employs a principled exploration strategy by combining pessimistic and optimistic policies via the Wasserstein barycenter, dynamically adjusting exploration during training.

Result: WBSAC demonstrates superior sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms in MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: The method introduces an effective way to tackle sample efficiency challenges in reinforcement learning and shows the potential of directed exploration strategies for sparse-reward domains.

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

*Antonio Ferrara,Francesco Cozzi,Alan Perotti,André Panisson,Francesco Bonchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a statistical framework for assessing fairness in algorithmic decision-making systems, addressing sampling errors and small demographic subgroup challenges in fairness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness evaluation metrics in algorithmic systems lack statistical robustness and struggle with granularity in demographic subgroups, especially in intersectional analyses.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid statistical framework: a Central-Limit-based Wald test for large subgroups and a Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial estimator for small intersectional subgroups.

Result: The methods are validated on benchmark datasets, showing improved interpretability and statistical rigor in fairness testing across diverse data scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework turns fairness assessments into evidence-based statistical decisions, effectively addressing sampling and subgroup size issues in fairness metrics.

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

Result: GA significantly improved accuracy for complex datasets, while PCA was beneficial for low-dimensional and noise-free datasets.

Conclusion: Feature engineering techniques like GA and PCA are interdependent and enhance MLP performance, providing practical optimization strategies for machine learning applications.

*Yuhui Ding,Thomas Hofmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach for 3D molecule generation by relaxing symmetry constraints in diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in scalability and efficiency caused by specialized equivariant architectures in existing 3D molecule generation models.

Method: The method proposes a sample-dependent SO(3) transformation to align latent space representations, enabling the use of non-equivariant diffusion models.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance over non-equivariant models and comparable results to state-of-the-art equivariant models while improving efficiency in training and sampling.

Conclusion: Relaxing equivariance constraints enables scalable and efficient 3D molecule generation without significant performance trade-offs, offering a practical alternative to fully equivariant models.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

### [234] [Rethinking Losses for Diffusion Bridge Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10982)
*Sebastian Sanokowski,Lukas Gruber,Christoph Bartmann,Sepp Hochreiter,Sebastian Lehner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares Log Variance (LV) and reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) losses for training diffusion bridges, concluding that rKL with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) outperforms LV in performance and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods like the Log Variance loss in optimizing diffusion bridges and identify a more effective and theoretically sound objective function.

Method: The authors analyze the theoretical differences between the LV and rKL losses, focusing on their behavior with the log-derivative trick and diffusion bridges. They also conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of samplers trained with these losses on challenging benchmarks.

Result: Experimental results show that the rKL-LD loss not only avoids conceptual issues of the LV loss but also achieves better performance in various benchmarks. It requires less hyperparameter tuning and provides more stable training.

Conclusion: The rKL-LD loss is a superior and more practical alternative to the LV loss for training diffusion bridges, offering conceptual clarity, improved performance, and better training stability.

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

### [236] [DynaSubVAE: Adaptive Subgrouping for Scalable and Robust OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10200)
*Tina Behrouzi,Sana Tonekaboni,Rahul G. Krishnan,Anna Goldenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DynaSubVAE, a dynamic model that identifies and adapts to emerging data subpopulations, excelling in OOD detection and outperforming conventional clustering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of underrepresented and emerging heterogeneous subpopulations in real-world data that lead to inaccuracies or harmful predictions.

Method: Proposed DynaSubVAE, a framework combining representation learning and adaptive OOD detection using a dynamic latent structure and a non-parametric clustering mechanism inspired by Gaussian Mixture Models.

Result: DynaSubVAE achieved high accuracy in OOD detection, particularly class-OOD scenarios, and surpassed traditional clustering methods like GMM and KMeans++ in key performance metrics.

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE efficiently adapts to new trends in data, providing a robust solution to detecting and modeling underrepresented subpopulations while improving overall prediction reliability.

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the challenges arising from the massive size of large language models, especially for deployment in resource-constrained environments like edge devices.

Method: The paper proposes AWP, a novel layer-wise post-training compression scheme that unifies activation-aware weight pruning and quantization using a projected gradient descent method. This approach connects pruning to sparse approximation and builds on the iterative hard-thresholding framework.

Result: Experimental results show that AWP surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods for pruning and quantizing large language models, offering improved model compression performance.

Conclusion: AWP provides an effective and theoretically grounded solution for compressing large language models, making them more suitable for deployment on constrained devices.

Abstract: To address the enormous size of Large Language Models (LLMs), model
compression methods, such as quantization and pruning, are often deployed,
especially on edge devices. In this work, we focus on layer-wise post-training
quantization and pruning. Drawing connections between activation-aware weight
pruning and sparse approximation problems, and motivated by the success of
Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), we propose a unified method for
Activation-aware Weight pruning and quantization via Projected gradient descent
(AWP). Our experiments demonstrate that AWP outperforms state-of-the-art LLM
pruning and quantization methods. Theoretical convergence guarantees of the
proposed method for pruning are also provided.

*Sajjad Karimi,Amit J. Shah,Gari D. Clifford,Reza Sameni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study analyzes the relationship between ECG and PCG signals to better understand their mutual reconstruction and potential for biomarker extraction, using machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the incomplete understanding of the overlapping and distinct information in ECG and PCG signals and their potential for mutual reconstruction, particularly under varying physiological conditions and across individuals.

Method: The authors used the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous ECG-PCG recordings and applied both linear and nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to examine reconstruction capabilities and evaluate causality, physiological conditions, and cross-subject variability.

Result: The paper found that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provided better reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG being more successful than vice versa. Envelop-based modeling improved cross-subject generalizability, and clinically relevant ECG biomarkers could be derived from PCG in cross-subject settings.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of the relationship between ECG and PCG modalities in terms of waveform characteristics and event timing, offering potential applications for new multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

*Yuji Kawamata,Kaoru Kamijo,Maki Kihira,Akihiro Toyoda,Tomoru Nakayama,Akira Imakura,Tetsuya Sakurai,Yukihiko Okada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DC-Clustering, a federated clustering method suitable for complex data partitioning scenarios, which achieves performance similar to centralized methods while preserving privacy and requiring minimal communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need to analyze sensitive data across institutions requires federated learning methods that can handle complex distributed data structures while preserving privacy.

Method: The study proposes DC-Clustering, a federated clustering approach where institutions share intermediate representations instead of raw data. It supports both k-means and spectral clustering and requires only one round of communication for final results.

Result: Experiments using synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrated that DC-Clustering achieves comparable performance to centralized clustering solutions even under complex data partitioning scenarios.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering fills a significant gap in federated learning by enabling privacy-preserving, efficient, and flexible clustering over heterogeneous distributed data, making it highly relevant for privacy-sensitive fields such as healthcare and finance.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

*Ryota Ueda,Takami Sato,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies challenges in semidefinite programming (SDP) for deep neural network (DNN) verification and proposes solutions to address feasibility issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in SDP relaxation for DNN verification, specifically the interior-point vanishing problem which compromises numerical stability and scalability as the depth of neural networks increases.

Method: The authors conducted theoretical and empirical analyses to identify the issue of strict feasibility loss in SDP. They then designed five corrective solutions to enhance feasibility and tested their effectiveness.

Result: The proposed methods successfully addressed 88% of previously unsolvable verification problems, which represents 41% of the total problems analyzed.

Conclusion: The study uncovers fundamental limitations in current SDP-based verification methods and provides practical solutions to enhance their scalability and reliability for deeper DNNs.

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

*Jiajin Liu,Dongzhe Fan,Jiacheng Shen,Chuanhao Ji,Daochen Zha,Qiaoyu Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph-MLLM, a benchmark for multimodal graph learning, systematically comparing three approaches: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor, across diverse datasets. Findings underline the advantage of integrating visual and textual node attributes and fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multimodal graph learning lack a unified benchmark to fairly evaluate different approaches and make it difficult to assess progress.

Method: The authors establish the Graph-MLLM benchmark to evaluate three paradigms (MLLM-as-Encoder, MLLM-as-Aligner, MLLM-as-Predictor) across six diverse datasets, conducting extensive experiments.

Result: Experiments show that combining visual and textual attributes benefits graph learning, converting visual inputs into textual descriptions boosts performance, and fine-tuning MLLMs achieves state-of-the-art results in many scenarios.

Conclusion: The benchmarking highlights key strategies for improving multimodal graph learning, providing a fair platform for evaluation and encouraging future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

*Luc Raszewski,Christine De Kock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying malicious sockpuppets on Wikipedia using meta-learning techniques to improve adaptability and performance in data-scarce environments, achieving better precision than pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting malicious sockpuppets is essential to maintaining the reliability of information online and preventing disinformation, but existing approaches struggle with author-specific behaviours and limited data.

Method: The study employs meta-learning, which involves training models across multiple tasks to optimize them for rapid adaptation to the unique writing styles of sockpuppet-groups.

Result: The meta-learning approach demonstrated significant improvements in prediction precision over standard pre-trained models in identifying sockpuppets.

Conclusion: Meta-learning offers a promising advancement in detecting sockpuppets, particularly in data-scarce settings, with the release of a new sockpuppet investigation dataset supporting future research.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PyLO, a PyTorch-based library that applies learned optimizers to real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks, increasing their accessibility and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make advanced learned optimizers like VeLO accessible to a broader community by addressing implementation barriers like reliance on JAX and lack of user-friendly frameworks.

Method: The authors developed PyLO, a library in PyTorch including CUDA-accelerated implementations of learned optimizers, and demonstrated its effectiveness on large-scale tasks like training a ViT B/16 model.

Result: PyLO significantly improved training throughput – from 39.36 to 205.59 samples/sec when training a ViT B/16 model. The framework also showed enhanced performance when combined with tools like learning rate schedules.

Conclusion: PyLO successfully makes learned optimizers more accessible and practical for real-world applications, facilitating their integration into familiar machine learning workflows.

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes Learning from Language Feedback (LLF), introduces a complexity measure called transfer eluder dimension, and proposes the HELiX algorithm for efficient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of large language model agents has sparked interest in learning from observation and language feedback, with a need for principled frameworks to address decision problems in this domain.

Method: The authors formalize the LLF problem, define transfer eluder dimension to measure complexity, and develop the HELiX algorithm for sequential interactions in LLF problems.

Result: The paper shows learning with rich language feedback can be exponentially faster than traditional reward-based learning, and HELiX performs effectively across empirical domains.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundational step towards principled algorithms for learning from language feedback and demonstrates the value of transfer eluder dimension in scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

*Yanlong Chen,Mattia Orlandi,Pierangelo Maria Rapa,Simone Benatti,Luca Benini,Yawei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel wavelet-based approach and pretrained models for physiological signal analysis, achieving superior performance and addressing challenges like noise and device mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physiological signals are complex with low-SNR disturbances, non-stationarity, and inter-subject variability, requiring new methods for effective analysis.

Method: A wavelet-based approach captures multi-scale time-frequency features, with pretrained models for EMG and ECG alongside a multi-modal framework integrating EEG.

Result: The models outperform existing methods in signal analysis tasks, setting new benchmarks and successfully handling multi-modal challenges.

Conclusion: This approach advances physiological signal analysis, offering solutions for wearable health monitoring and broader biomedical applications.

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

### [246] [History-Aware Neural Operator: Robust Data-Driven Constitutive Modeling of Path-Dependent Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10352)
*Binyao Guo,Zihan Lin,QiZhi He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), a neural-network-based model that predicts path-dependent inelastic material responses without relying on hidden states, achieving improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models dealing with path-dependent inelastic material responses often face self-consistency and hidden state dependence issues, prompting the need for a more reliable, data-driven approach.

Method: The authors developed HANO, an autoregressive framework built on Fourier-based neural operators with a hierarchical self-attention mechanism, allowing for discretization-invariant learning and effective handling of complex loading conditions.

Result: HANO consistently outperformed baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and robustness when evaluated on elastoplasticity and anisotropic damage benchmarks.

Conclusion: HANO is an effective surrogate for simulating the behavior of inelastic materials, demonstrating strong performance and suitability for integration with classical numerical solvers.

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

*Yu-Yang Qian,Yuan-Ze Xu,Zhen-Yu Zhang,Peng Zhao,Zhi-Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TreeLoRA, a novel method for efficient continual learning in large pre-trained models using hierarchical gradient similarities and sparse updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient continual learning in streaming environments poses challenges due to the computational demands of large pre-trained models (LPMs), which necessitates a solution to balance adaptation to new tasks and preservation of past knowledge without significant resource usage.

Method: TreeLoRA constructs layer-wise low-rank adapters using hierarchical gradient similarity. Bandit-based algorithms are employed for efficient task similarity estimation, and sparse gradient updates are utilized to optimize parameters.

Result: Theoretical analysis supports the approach's foundations, and experiments on vision transformers and large language models in applications such as vision and natural language processing confirm its effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: TreeLoRA provides an effective and efficient solution for continual learning in LPMs, addressing computational constraints while maintaining task adaptability and knowledge retention.

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

*Penguin Huang,Chhavi Yadav,Ruihan Wu,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PropInfer, a benchmark for studying property inference attacks in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs increasingly tailored for domain-specific applications, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive dataset-level properties is critical. However, it was unclear whether property inference attacks used on other models are feasible in LLMs.

Method: The authors developed PropInfer as a benchmark for property inference in LLMs fine-tuned for question-answering or chat-completion tasks. This included defining tailored attacks like prompt-based generation and shadow-model attacks focusing on word frequency.

Result: The evaluation across multiple pretrained LLMs demonstrated the success of the proposed attacks, exposing the vulnerability of LLMs to property inference.

Conclusion: LLMs fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets are vulnerable to property inference attacks, highlighting the need for safeguarding techniques for dataset-level confidentiality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for
complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced

Motivation: To address the challenges of high API costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases in using LLMs for evaluating their own outputs.

Method: The approach involves synthesizing executable judging programs via LLMs that are interpretable, auditable, and reusable.

Result: Program-based judges improve judgment consistency by 15.83%, reduce bias by 23.7%, and outperform existing metrics by up to 8.67%, while significantly reducing costs.

Conclusion: PAJAMA offers a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient solution for LLM evaluation by leveraging program-based judgment systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

TL;DR: The paper develops a wildfire progression estimation method using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network trained on historic simulations, leveraging VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES ignition times, and terrain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the divergence of wildfire model predictions from observed progressions during multi-day simulations, highlighting the need for robust data assimilation techniques.

Method: A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained on historic data from the WRF-SFIRE atmosphere-wildfire model to estimate fire arrival times from satellite-derived fire data and terrain information.

Result: The approach was validated on five US Pacific wildfires, achieving an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81 when compared against high-resolution aircraft perimeters. Terrain data's influence on arrival time was found to be minimal when conditioned with satellite measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully integrates wildfire measurements into a predictive framework, demonstrating the potential to improve fire progression estimates and supporting its use for real-world applications.

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of existing benchmarks which assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal time series data, while real-world data is often irregular, multimodal, and messy.

Method: The authors developed Time-IMM, a dataset capturing nine types of time series irregularities, and IMM-TSF, a benchmark library that includes advanced data fusion modules for realistic forecasting evaluation.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that explicitly modeling multimodality in irregular time series significantly improves forecasting performance.

Conclusion: Time-IMM and IMM-TSF offer essential advancements in analyzing and forecasting irregular multimodal time series, promising real-world applicability.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

*Weiying Zhao,Aleksei Unagaev,Natalia Efremova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid method combining spectral clustering with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to improve soil organic carbon (SOC) sampling representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SOC monitoring methods using environmental covariates sometimes overlook smaller but critical environmental clusters, leading to incomplete sampling and less effective predictions.

Method: The study integrates spectral clustering to divide a study area into homogeneous zones and applies cLHS within each zone to select representative sampling locations.

Result: Using a real SOC mapping dataset, the spectral-cLHS method demonstrated uniform coverage in feature space and spatial heterogeneity compared to standard cLHS.

Conclusion: The hybrid method enhances sampling design for SOC monitoring, potentially leading to more accurate predictions in machine learning-based SOC models.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortage of skilled engineers and the inefficiency of manual PCB schematic optimizations, which, if neglected, lead to higher troubleshooting costs, shortened product life cycles, and increased electronic waste.

Method: The authors automate PCB schematic optimization by representing schematics as bipartite graphs and using a node pair prediction model based on GNNs. Various GNN architectures are applied to real-world, expert-labeled datasets for comparative evaluation.

Result: The study demonstrates high accuracy of GNNs on three PCB design optimization tasks using expert-labeled datasets, highlighting their capability to automate circuit design improvements.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise in automating PCB design optimization, offering benefits such as cost and time efficiency while addressing challenges in electronic waste and development bottlenecks.

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled

*Yu-Jie Zhang,Peng Zhao,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves dynamic regret minimization for non-stationary online learning by leveraging mixability, achieving better performance and simplifying the analytical framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in dynamic regret minimization for functions with stronger curvature (like squared or logistic loss) in non-stationary online learning, which has largely been underexplored compared to convex functions.

Method: The method employs an exponential-weight algorithm with fixed-share updates, leveraging mixability, which generalizes exp-concavity, allowing effective capture of loss curvature and simplifying the analytical framework.

Result: The work achieves a tighter dynamic regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$, significantly improving upon the prior bound of $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$, particularly in terms of dimensionality $d$.

Conclusion: The study presents a significant advancement in dynamic regret minimization for mixable losses, achieving both improved performance and simplification in the analytical approach, marking an important development in the field of online learning.

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage pipeline for accurately digitizing ECG recordings, especially in scenarios with overlapping signals. It outperforms a baseline in both accuracy and robustness, and the implementation is publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of inaccurately digitizing ECG recordings, a problem amplified by signal overlaps in single leads that current methods fail to handle effectively.

Method: The researchers propose a two-stage pipeline. The first stage uses a U-Net based segmentation network, enhanced with data augmentations, to isolate the primary ECG trace. The second stage converts the segmentation results into time-series data using improved digitization techniques, including an adaptive grid detection module.

Result: The method achieved high accuracy with the U-Net segmenting at an IoU of 0.87. For non-overlapping signals, the digitization achieved an MSE of 0.0010 and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9644, outperforming a baseline that achieved 0.0015 and 0.9366. For overlapping signals, the method achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and correlation coefficient of 0.9641, significantly better than the baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively improves digitization accuracy, particularly in the challenging case of signal overlaps, making it a reliable solution for modern clinical and research applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrated a favorable balance between computational dimension and performance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully improves scalability while maintaining high performance, showing promise for high-dimensional graph learning problems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

### [262] [Task Adaptation from Skills: Information Geometry, Disentanglement, and New Objectives for Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10629)
*Yucheng Yang,Tianyi Zhou,Qiang He,Lei Han,Mykola Pechenizkiy,Meng Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) in unsupervised reinforcement learning and introduces theoretically improved metrics and algorithms for improved adaptation to downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in unsupervised reinforcement learning, specifically MISL, lack sufficient theoretical analysis for downstream task adaptation, including diversity and separability of skills.

Method: The authors propose a new disentanglement metric LSEPIN, introduce Wasserstein distance-based measures, and present novel geometric analyses leading to enhanced learning objectives, WSEP and PWSEP.

Result: The proposed methods show improved theoretical guarantees for downstream task adaptation and are capable of discovering a wider range of initial policies compared to MISL.

Conclusion: LSEPIN, WSEP, and PWSEP provide a more optimized and comprehensive framework for skill learning, addressing critical gaps in existing methods and enhancing downstream task adaptation capabilities.

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

### [263] [Time Series Forecasting as Reasoning: A Slow-Thinking Approach with Reinforced LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10630)
*Yucong Luo,Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Jiahao Wang,Daoyu Wang,Tingyue Pan,Jintao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Time-R1, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework to enhance multi-step reasoning in time series forecasting (TSF), addressing limitations in existing fast-thinking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TSF methods lack an explicit thinking process and rely on fast-thinking paradigms. Emerging slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multi-step reasoning capabilities but face limitations such as computational costs, privacy risks, and insufficient domain-specific reasoning.

Method: Time-R1 applies a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning approach: supervised fine-tuning for model adaptation and reinforcement learning with fine-grained multi-objective rewards and GRIP strategy to optimize time series reasoning.

Result: Experiments show that Time-R1 significantly enhances forecast accuracy across various datasets, validating its effectiveness in TSF.

Conclusion: Time-R1 provides a novel framework combining slow-thinking principles and reinforcement learning to address gaps in existing TSF methods, achieving superior prediction performance and reasoning skills.

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

*Alexander Lobashev,Dmitry Guskov,Maria Larchenko,Mikhail Tamm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to explore the latent space geometry of generative models by reconstructing the Fisher information metric and discovers phase transitions in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a deeper understanding of the complex latent space geometries of generative models, particularly in relation to phase transitions and their statistical and geometric properties.

Method: The method approximates the posterior distribution of latent variables from generated samples to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric. Theoretical convergence guarantees and validations on models like Ising and TASEP are included.

Result: The method achieves better performance in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities compared to baselines and identifies a fractal structure of phase transitions and metric divergences in diffusion model latent spaces.

Conclusion: This research offers insights into latent space geometry, highlighting phase transition behaviors and providing tools for better analyzing generative models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

### [265] [Data Shifts Hurt CoT: A Theoretical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10647)
*Lang Yin,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work explores how Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning is affected by real-world issues like data distribution shifts and data poisoning, especially in solving the $k$-parity problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the reasoning capabilities of transformers using CoT has shown potential, but real-world data inconsistencies could undermine its effectiveness.

Method: The paper investigates the $k$-parity problem under CoT reasoning by simulating distribution shifts and data poisoning, analyzing their joint effects rigorously.

Result: The study finds that CoT reasoning can perform worse than direct prediction methods under real-world data challenges, such as shifts and poisoned training data.

Conclusion: CoT reasoning's susceptibility to data shifts and corruption highlights limitations for its application in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Saturation Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM) to combat catastrophic forgetting in neural systems during continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in neural systems when exposed to sequential tasks.

Method: SatSOM uses a novel saturation mechanism to reduce learning rates and focus on underutilized neurons, ensuring well-trained areas retain information effectively.

Result: SatSOM modifies traditional SOMs and enhances their ability for knowledge retention under continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism improves continual learning efficiency and mitigates forgetting, offering a new approach for neural system design.

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

*Floris Holstege,Shauli Ravfogel,Bram Wouters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLICE is a new method to remove unwanted concepts from neural network representations without significantly degrading information useful for the main task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often inadvertently encode unwanted concepts that raise fairness and interpretability issues, necessitating mechanisms to remove such biases while preserving task-related information.

Method: SPLICE uses an oblique projection technique that removes unwanted concept directions in the embedding while exactly maintaining the covariance of target labels.

Result: SPLICE empirically outperforms existing methods in removing sensitive attributes with minimal damage to main-task information on fairness benchmarks like Bias in Bios and Winobias.

Conclusion: SPLICE is theoretically justified and practically effective for addressing fairness and interpretability concerns in neural networks by removing linear concept predictability while preserving target covariance.

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConTextTab integrates semantic understanding with a table-native In-Context Learning (ICL) framework and achieves competitive performance on various benchmarks, excelling on the CARTE benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current tabular ICL models—either by lacking rich semantics due to synthetic data training (e.g., TabPFN, TabICL) or being constrained by context size limitations in large language model-based approaches (e.g., TabuLa-8B).

Method: ConTextTab uses specialized embeddings for different data modalities and trains on large-scale real-world tabular datasets to combine semantic understanding with efficient tabular data processing.

Result: The model performs competitively with state-of-the-art tabular ICL models and establishes a new benchmark on the semantically rich CARTE dataset.

Conclusion: ConTextTab successfully merges semantic comprehension and tabular-specific architectures to enhance in-context learning, balancing the strengths of table-native and large language model-based approaches.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for automating question answering in electronic health records, focusing on evidence retrieval and answer generation, achieving promising results without heavy model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in information for clinicians and patients, the need is for precise and trustworthy QA systems in healthcare settings, particularly in high-stakes environments.

Method: The method splits the clinical QA task into evidence identification and answer synthesis stages, uses prompt optimization through DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, and employs self-consistency voting to improve results.

Result: The proposed approach scored 51.5 on a hidden test set, achieving second place in the BioNLP 2025 ArchEHR-QA shared task and significantly outperforming traditional prompting techniques.

Conclusion: Data-driven optimization of prompts, rather than model fine-tuning, offers a practical and effective approach for improving AI reliability in healthcare QA systems.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FGN, an ML-based weather model that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing accurate ensemble forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional weather forecasting methods, like numerical weather prediction, have limitations in terms of accuracy and speed. Recent ML-based models have shown promise, and this work aims to further improve upon their capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a scalable approach, FGN, which generates weather ensembles via learned model perturbations and is directly trained to minimize CRPS. The system uses constrained models to ensure better performance.

Result: FGN achieves state-of-the-art performance in deterministic and probabilistic metrics, improves tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures spatial structures despite training only on marginals.

Conclusion: FGN offers a significant advancement in ML-based weather forecasting, providing superior accuracy and flexibility compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based weather models have rapidly risen to prominence
due to their greater accuracy and speed than traditional forecasts based on
numerical weather prediction (NWP), recently outperforming traditional
ensembles in global probabilistic weather forecasting. This paper presents FGN,
a simple, scalable and flexible modeling approach which significantly
outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. FGN generates ensembles via
learned model-perturbations with an ensemble of appropriately constrained
models. It is trained directly to minimize the continuous rank probability
score (CRPS) of per-location forecasts. It produces state-of-the-art ensemble
forecasts as measured by a range of deterministic and probabilistic metrics,
makes skillful ensemble tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures joint
spatial structure despite being trained only on marginals.

### [271] [Monotone Classification with Relative Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10775)
*Yufei Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines monotone classification, where the goal is to identify a monotone classifier with minimal error under cost constraints. It defines "cost" as the number of label-revealing points used, and provides tight bounds for algorithms that achieve near-optimal error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies on monotone classification struggled to achieve near-optimal error rates, focusing instead on algorithms whose error exceeds optimal by an absolute factor. This paper seeks to improve accuracy by allowing only a relative factor increase over the optimal error.

Method: The research introduces an analytic approach to calculate the smallest cost needed for finding a monotone classifier. It establishes theoretical bounds by comparing error rates and required resources across a range of $\\epsilon$ values.

Result: The authors demonstrate nearly matching upper and lower bounds of cost required for monotone classification while ensuring the error is at most $(1 + \\epsilon) \cdot k^*$. This represents progress compared to prior methods that allowed absolute rather than relative error thresholds.

Conclusion: The findings set new theoretical benchmarks for monotone classification, achieving cost-efficient computation of near-optimal classifiers. This advancement resolves limitations seen in earlier studies by focusing on relative error increases rather than absolute ones.

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

TL;DR: The study introduces a new energy function, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), for Dense Associative Memory networks, demonstrating exponential capacity and emergent creativity without exponential separation functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Dense Associative Memory networks by addressing limitations of the commonly used log-sum-exponential (LSE) function and enabling novel functionalities.

Method: They propose and test the log-sum-ReLU (LSR) energy function inspired by the Epanechnikov kernel, evaluating its performance in memory retrieval and pattern recovery.

Result: Empirical results show LSR energy enables exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity, introduces emergent local minima without reducing recovery accuracy, and provides creative and novel outputs on image datasets.

Conclusion: LSR offers a promising alternative for enhancing DenseAM networks, enabling improved large-scale memory storage and generative capabilities through emergent memory creativity.

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores using activation probes for efficient monitoring of high-risk interactions with Large Language Models, offering computationally affordable alternatives to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and safe monitoring systems for deploying Large Language Models, specifically for detecting interactions that might lead to high-stakes or harmful outcomes.

Method: The authors train and evaluate various activation probe architectures on synthetic datasets and test their generalization on diverse, real-world scenarios. They also compare performance and computational cost to conventional LLM monitoring approaches.

Result: The probes demonstrated robust generalization capabilities and performed comparably to medium-sized LLM monitors, while delivering significant computational savings (six orders of magnitude).

Conclusion: Activation probes present a resource-efficient solution for hierarchical monitoring systems, acting as an initial filter for identifying high-stakes interactions, thereby enabling scalable and safe model deployments.

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

TL;DR: Dynamic Deep Learning Systems (DDLSs) improve efficiency by adapting computations to input complexity, but this introduces security vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a taxonomy of efficiency-based attacks and evaluates current defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing deployment of DDLSs in resource-constrained environments, examining efficiency-related adversarial vulnerabilities is critical for securing real-time applications.

Method: The authors provide a taxonomy of efficiency attacks on DDLSs, categorize attacks into three groups based on dynamic behaviors, perform in-depth evaluations of adversarial strategies, and analyze existing defense mechanisms.

Result: The study identifies vulnerabilities in DDLSs, highlights the limitations of current defense mechanisms, and underscores the need for novel approaches to protect adaptive systems.

Conclusion: Dynamic mechanisms in DDLSs introduce new attack surfaces, necessitating innovative and robust defenses to secure these increasingly crucial systems.

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning framework to detect credit card fraud by using a variety of unsupervised models on combined datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing digital transactions require efficient systems to detect and prevent fraud, necessitating advanced analytical solutions.

Method: The system integrates multiple datasets for feature engineering, applies unsupervised models such as Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and deep autoencoders, and uses clustering techniques for anomaly detection.

Result: The models successfully identify top anomalous transactions and visualize them in low-dimensional spaces to separate normal and fraudulent activities.

Conclusion: The study confirms the framework's effectiveness in detecting transaction anomalies and contributes towards improving fraud detection systems with real-world data.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

*Pierre-François Massiani,Alexander von Rohr,Lukas Haverbeck,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how entropy regularization and constraints penalization can improve robust safety in reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrating that these approaches enhance constraints satisfaction and resilience to disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of learning policies in RL that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown disturbances, an open problem despite advancements in RL.

Method: The authors analyze two techniques: entropy regularization, which promotes future viable actions, and constraints penalization, which approximates constrained RL as unconstrained RL for better safety and optimality. Empirical evaluations are conducted.

Result: Empirical evaluations reveal that entropy regularization biases learning toward robust constraints satisfaction, and reformulating constrained RL enhances resilience to disturbances while preserving safety and optimality.

Conclusion: The connection between entropy regularization and robustness is promising for enabling robust safety in RL through simple reward shaping, warranting further investigation.

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new attack method, "lattice climber attack," for finite mixtures of classifiers to improve robustness against adversarial attacks, along with a discussion on existing methods' inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of current attacks on finite mixtures of classifiers, as they fail to meet key desirable properties for robustness against adversarial attacks.

Method: The authors define two desirable properties of attacks based on geometric analysis (effectiveness and maximality) and propose the "lattice climber attack," supported with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show the effectiveness and superiority of the lattice climber attack in meeting the identified desirable properties.

Conclusion: The study identifies and addresses shortcomings in existing adversarial attacks through a geometric framework, introducing an improved and validated attack method for finite mixtures of classifiers.

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

*Subham Sekhar Sahoo,Justin Deschenaux,Aaron Gokaslan,Guanghan Wang,Justin Chiu,Volodymyr Kuleshov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves discrete diffusion models' performance for text generation using insights from Gaussian diffusion, introducing innovations in training and sampling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to narrow the performance gap between uniform-state discrete diffusion models and other text generation models, enabling faster and more effective diffusion-based text generation.

Method: The approach introduces a curriculum learning strategy to accelerate training and a Discrete Consistency Distillation algorithm to significantly speed up sampling.

Result: The training speed is doubled, and the diffusion models outperform autoregressive models on 3 out of 7 benchmarks in zero-shot perplexity. Sampling speed improves by two orders of magnitude for few-step generation.

Conclusion: Their methods improve the efficiency and effectiveness of text generation using discrete diffusion models, achieving competitive benchmarks and faster sample generation.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

### [279] [NoLoCo: No-all-reduce Low Communication Training Method for Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10911)
*Jari Kolehmainen,Nikolay Blagoev,John Donaghy,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Christopher Nies*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NoLoCo is a novel training method for large language models that avoids explicit parameter synchronization, significantly reducing communication overhead compared to other methods like DiLoCo, while also achieving faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale language model training on clusters with tens of thousands of accelerators is communication-intensive, requiring high-bandwidth interconnects. This can be prohibitively expensive and impractical, necessitating more efficient methods.

Method: NoLoCo removes the need for collective communication by using a variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer, where model weights are partially averaged with a randomly chosen other model during training instead of full synchronization.

Result: NoLoCo demonstrates reduced communication costs and synchronization time compared to methods like DiLoCo. It requires an order of magnitude less time for the synchronization step and achieves up to 4% faster convergence across various model sizes (125M to 6.8B parameters) and numbers of accelerators.

Conclusion: NoLoCo offers an efficient, scalable alternative to traditional and state-of-the-art methods for training large language models, particularly on low-bandwidth networks.

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

*Yuchen Ma,Dennis Frauen,Emil Javurek,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalFM, a framework using PFNs for Bayesian causal inference, supporting diverse causal settings and outperforming benchmarks in treatment effect estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal inference methods often lack generalizability and simplicity. This work leverages the PFNs approach to create a universal framework for causal inference across various settings.

Method: 1. Formalize Bayesian priors for causal inference using structural causal models (SCMs). 2. Propose prior distributions inspired by causality-based Bayesian neural networks. 3. Train a PFN foundation model for causal inference, specifically for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs).

Result: CausalFM demonstrated competitive performance in estimating CATEs across synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks, showcasing its efficacy across back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment.

Conclusion: CausalFM provides a novel framework for causal inference that leverages PFNs to simplify and generalize the estimation process. This approach has implications for advancing causal inference methods in disciplines like medicine and economics.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

*Morris Yau,Sharut Gupta,Valerie Engelmayer,Kazuki Irie,Stefanie Jegelka,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a class of neural models called Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs), which unify existing architectures and achieve efficient sequential-parallel duality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of designing neural sequence models that balance parallelizable training with efficient sequential inference.

Method: Defines the PSM framework by relaxing the state aggregation operators and introduces a unified architecture encompassing various models. Evaluates them empirically using language modeling and synthetic tasks.

Result: PSMs match the inference efficiency of state space models and exhibit transformer-level expressivity while improving length generalization in some tasks.

Conclusion: PSMs effectively bridge the gap between state space models and transformers, combining efficiency and expressivity.

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

*Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines biases in large language models (LLMs) used in hiring and proposes internal bias mitigation techniques to reduce demographic biases, even with realistic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and reduce demographic biases in LLMs particularly when they are used in sensitive and high-stakes scenarios like hiring decisions, as traditional bias prompts fail in realistic contexts.

Method: They identify and neutralize sensitive attribute directions in LLM activations using affine concept editing during inference, based on directions derived from synthetic datasets.

Result: The proposed method successfully reduces biases (to under 1% and always below 2.5%) across leading commercial and open-source LLMs while largely preserving model performance.

Conclusion: Practitioners should adopt realistic evaluation methodologies and apply internal mitigation strategies to ensure equitable and unbiased outcomes in hiring applications using LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

TL;DR: SEAL is a framework allowing LLMs to self-adapt by generating their finetuning data and directives for weight updates. It enables models to persistently adapt in response to new tasks or knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are static and unable to adapt their weights to learn new knowledge or tasks, limiting their flexibility and effectiveness.

Method: SEAL employs self-edits generated by the model to improve itself, combining supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning to optimize downstream performance.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SEAL in incorporating knowledge and improving few-shot generalization.

Conclusion: SEAL represents a significant step toward autonomous, self-directed adaptation for large language models, addressing their static nature.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

### [285] [GUARD: Guided Unlearning and Retention via Data Attribution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10946)
*Evelyn Ma,Duo Zhou,Peizhi Niu,Huiting Zhou,Huan Zhang,Olgica Milenkovic,S. Rasoul Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUARD is a framework for improving the unlearning process in large language models, with a focus on minimizing unintended data loss and enhancing retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to address the issue of unintended forgetting in LLM unlearning processes, which can degrade model utility and retention.

Method: The method involves introducing a proxy data attribution metric and designing a new unlearning objective that dynamically adjusts weights to mitigate retention loss while efficiently forgetting specified data.

Result: Experiments show that GUARD improves utility preservation substantially, with notable improvements on the TOFU benchmark and reduced utility sacrifice, enhancing retention during unlearning.

Conclusion: GUARD proves to be an effective solution for enhancing retention while achieving targeted unlearning, backed by theoretical guarantees and strong experimental evidence.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), incorporating real-time execution signals into neural code generation to improve code quality and achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models show strong code generation abilities but lack real-time execution feedback, which is a standard practice for human programmers to ensure code correctness.

Method: The EG-CFG method performs a multi-stage process incorporating line-by-line execution feedback during code generation. It conducts beam search for code snippets, executes them for feedback, and updates prompts dynamically while supporting parallelism for efficient exploration.

Result: EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance, outperforming current methods across diverse and complex coding tasks, including competitive programming.

Conclusion: Incorporating real-time execution feedback in LLM-based code generation enhances its capability to produce executable and correct solutions, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper advocates for creating Agentic Web Interfaces (AWIs), specifically tailored for AI agents to navigate web environments, addressing the challenges posed by existing human-centered designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming the limitations of current AI approaches in web navigation, which struggle with human-designed interfaces that are not optimized for AI systems.

Method: The authors propose a paradigm shift by introducing the concept of Agentic Web Interfaces (AWIs) and outline six guiding principles for their design, focusing on safety, efficiency, and standardization.

Result: The framework introduces a new approach for designing web interfaces that are directly optimized for AI agents, rather than forcing adaptation to current human-centric designs.

Conclusion: The proposed AWI paradigm and guiding principles set a foundation for developing more efficient, reliable, and collaborative web agents, catalyzing advancements in the field.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

*Aayush Karan,Kulin Shah,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReGuidance, a wrapper to enhance sampling realism and reward for challenging inverse problems using pretrained diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the failure of existing methods like Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) on hard inverse problems where low signal-to-noise ratios or weak rewards lead to unrealistic outputs.

Method: ReGuidance works by inverting a candidate solution through unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse, followed by reinitializing DPS with the derived latent.

Result: ReGuidance improves sample quality and measurement consistency on complex tasks, like large box in-painting and high-upscaling super-resolution, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ReGuidance provides theoretical support and practical improvements, marking the first robust algorithmic guarantee for enhancing Diffusion Posterior Sampling.

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

TL;DR: This paper explores the theoretical understanding of in-context learning (ICL) for structured geometric data, particularly regression over Hölder functions on manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of ICL in various domains, its theoretical foundation for geometric structures remained unaddressed. The paper seeks to fill this gap.

Method: By connecting the attention mechanism used in transformers with classical kernel methods, the authors derive generalization error bounds and analyze regression rates.

Result: Transformers achieve the minimax regression rate for Hölder functions on manifolds with scaling depending on intrinsic manifold dimensions, not ambient space dimensions.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into geometry's role in ICL and introduces novel tools for understanding nonlinear models in this context.

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Farseer, a refined scaling law for training large language models (LLMs), which improves predictive accuracy and generalizability by systematically constructing a model loss surface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of training LLMs creates a scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments do not transfer effectively to large-scale systems, impeding innovation and efficiency.

Method: Farseer is developed by constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$ and training around 1,000 LLMs across various configurations to validate its improved accuracy and extrapolation capability.

Result: Farseer demonstrates a 433% reduction in extrapolation error compared to prior laws, providing better predictive accuracy and insights into optimal compute allocation for LLM training.

Conclusion: Farseer enables more reliable predictions of large-scale performance from small-scale experiments, addressing the scaling gap and fostering further research by open-sourcing its models and datasets.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning has excelled in computer vision and natural language processing but struggles to handle scientific problems formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces. Bridging this gap could lead to significant progress in scientific applications.

Method: The authors outline key principles for converting popular neural network architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications. They also provide practical implementation guidance and tools for operator learning.

Result: A framework and recipe are provided for transforming neural networks into neural operators, addressing challenges in operator learning for function spaces.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates how existing neural networks can be adapted to function spaces for scientific applications, leveraging deep learning's empirical successes for operator learning while simplifying implementation.

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

### [292] [From Tool Calling to Symbolic Thinking: LLMs in a Persistent Lisp Metaprogramming Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10021)
*Jordi de la Torre*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an architecture combining large language models (LLMs) with a persistent Lisp environment for dynamic and interactive programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to define, utilize, and evolve their tools in a persistent and interactive Lisp-based REPL setup.

Method: Embedding Lisp expressions into LLM outputs, using a middleware to manage interactions, enabling stateful external memory and dynamic creation tools.

Result: The paper presents a framework and principles for developing AI systems that merge symbolic programming and neural language models.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs with Lisp allows reflective programming, external memory, and dynamic tool building, paving the way for new interactive AI systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture for integrating large language models (LLMs)

define, invoke, and evolve their own tools through programmatic interaction
with a live REPL. By embedding Lisp expressions within generation and
intercepting them via a middleware layer, the system allows for stateful

### [293] [A Language-Agnostic Logical Relation for Message-Passing Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10026)
*Tesla Zhang,Sonya Simkin,Rui Li,Yue Yao,Stephanie Balzer*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for protocol compliance verification in heterogeneous, concurrent, message-passing systems using a language-agnostic logical relation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing reliance on heterogeneous, distributed systems (like IoT and cloud computing) and their complex concurrency and message-passing patterns necessitate robust protocol compliance verification mechanisms that work across diverse implementations and objects.

Method: The paper introduces a language-agnostic logical relation based on a labeled transition-based semantics. This approach supports arbitrary system components, whether typed, untyped, or external.

Result: The framework was instantiated in Coq theorem prover and validated through two case studies: verifying specific instances of applications/devices and verifying well-typed applications for a given type system.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the viability of language-agnostic verification techniques for ensuring protocol compliance in heterogeneous systems.

Abstract: Today's computing landscape has been gradually shifting to applications
targeting distributed and *heterogeneous* systems, such as cloud computing and
Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These applications are predominantly
*concurrent*, employ *message-passing*, and interface with *foreign objects*,
ranging from externally implemented code to actual physical devices such as
sensors. Verifying that the resulting systems adhere to the intended protocol
of interaction is challenging -- the usual assumption of a common
implementation language, let alone a type system, no longer applies, ruling out
any verification method based on them. This paper develops a framework for
certifying *protocol compliance* of heterogeneous message-passing systems. It
contributes the first mechanization of a *language-agnostic logical relation*,
asserting that its inhabitants comply with the protocol specified. This
definition relies entirely on a labelled transition-based semantics,
accommodating arbitrary inhabitants, typed and untyped alike, including foreign
objects. As a case study, the paper considers two scenarios: (1) *per-instance
verification* of a specific application or hardware device, and (2)
*once-and-for-all verification* of well-typed applications for a given type
system. The logical relation and both scenarios are mechanized in the Coq
theorem prover.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students struggle with inference rule application, lack of immediate feedback, and the tedious manual effort involved in derivation tasks.

Method: The paper introduces Hazel Deriver, which is built on the Hazel live programming environment. It provides layered scaffolding features through structured, interactive, and real-time feedback mechanisms.

Result: A preliminary user study indicated that Hazel Deriver reduces difficulty and improves conceptual understanding and engagement for students working on derivation tasks.

Conclusion: Hazel Deriver assists students in overcoming challenges with derivation tasks and highlights the balance needed between system guidance and learner autonomy.

Abstract: Students in programming languages and formal logic courses often struggle
with constructing rule-based derivation trees due to the complexity of applying
inference rules, the lack of immediate feedback, and the manual effort required
for handwritten proofs. We present Hazel Deriver, a live, web-based editor
designed to scaffold derivation construction through multiple layers of
support. Built on the Hazel live programming environment, it provides a
structured, interactive experience that encourages iterative exploration and
real-time feedback. A preliminary user study with former students suggests that
Hazel Deriver reduces the perceived difficulty of derivation tasks while
improving conceptual understanding and engagement. We discuss the design of its
layered scaffolding features and raise questions about balancing system
guidance with learner autonomy.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces $\lambda_{QC}$, a typed choreographic language enhancing concurrent programming by incorporating first-class process names, polymorphism, algebraic and recursive data types, and multiply-located values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing choreographic languages lack essential features for modern concurrent systems, such as dynamic computation of process locations and communication of those decisions.

Method: The authors developed $\lambda_{QC}$ with features like first-class process names, polymorphism, and advanced data type support, and verified its formal guarantees using Rocq, ensuring deadlock freedom.

Result: $\lambda_{QC}$ successfully addresses limitations in previous choreographic languages and enhances expressiveness and functionality.

Conclusion: The introduction of $\lambda_{QC}$ advances choreographic programming by incorporating critical features, ensuring deadlock freedom, and broadening its applicability to modern systems.

Abstract: Choreographic programming is a promising new paradigm for programming
concurrent systems where a developer writes a single centralized program that
compiles to individual programs for each node. Existing choreographic
languages, however, lack critical features integral to modern systems, like the
ability of one node to dynamically compute who should perform a computation and
send that decision to others. This work addresses this gap with $\lambda_{QC}$,
the first typed choreographic language with \emph{first class process names}
and polymorphism over both types and (sets of) locations. $\lambda_{QC}$ also
improves expressive power over previous work by supporting algebraic and
recursive data types as well as multiply-located values. We formalize and
mechanically verify our results in Rocq, including the standard choreographic
guarantee of deadlock freedom.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to make robotic systems in precision agriculture more versatile and user-friendly, addressing the difficulty faced by non-technical users in adapting robots for complex missions.

Method: The method involves leveraging large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to process natural language instructions, encoding tasks using an IEEE specification standard, and executing them on robots via ROS2 nodes using existing ROS libraries.

Result: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system in enabling complex mission planning but also highlights the limitations of LLMs, particularly in spatial reasoning and routing challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively bridges the gap between natural language instructions and robotic task execution, overcoming limitations of LLMs and enabling broader use for non-technical users in agriculture.

Abstract: Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing
precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed
for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains
challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In
this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language
models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data
collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To
enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task
specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge
high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive
experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this
context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing
challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

### [297] [Estimating the Joint Probability of Scenario Parameters with Gaussian Mixture Copula Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10098)
*Christian Reichenbächer,Philipp Rank,Jochen Hipp,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gaussian Mixture Copula Models for enhancing statistical modeling of driving scenarios in safety validation of automated driving systems, outperforming previous methods in fit quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to improve the statistical modeling of driving scenarios, critical for scenario-based safety assessments of automated driving systems, by addressing limitations in existing modeling techniques.

Method: The method combines Gaussian Mixture Models' multimodal expressivity and copulas' flexibility to separately model marginal distributions and dependencies. The new approach is evaluated using real-world driving data and benchmarked against Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models.

Result: The evaluation of 18 million driving scenarios shows that Gaussian Mixture Copula Models outperform prior methods in terms of likelihood and Sinkhorn distance, indicating a superior fit to the data.

Conclusion: Gaussian Mixture Copula Models offer a robust and flexible statistical modeling framework for automated driving safety validation, paving the way for improved scenario-based assessment systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a natural language-based robotic mission planner for non-technical users in precision agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Farmers often struggle with the complexity of adopting AI-driven tools in agriculture due to steep learning curves and technical challenges.

Method: The authors developed an architecture using large language models and predefined primitives to translate human-language commands into executable robotic actions.

Result: The system demonstrated success in handling diverse robotic tasks, including manipulation and computer vision, proving its generality and robustness.

Conclusion: The research makes robotic automation in precision agriculture user-friendly, especially for non-specialists, by simplifying control interfaces for heterogeneous robots.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

### [299] [A Navigation Framework Utilizing Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10172)
*Yicheng Duan,Kaiyu tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular system for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), integrating a frozen large vision-language model and lightweight planning to decouple understanding from action planning, specifically tested in Room-to-Room benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome challenges in VLN posed by computational demands of large vision-language models and real-time deployment constraints.

Method: They propose a framework combining Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with techniques like prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy.

Result: The system faces challenges in generalization to unseen environments within strict evaluation but succeeds in laying a modular groundwork for VLN.

Conclusion: The modular design shows potential for scalable and efficient navigation systems, suggesting avenues for improvement in leveraging environmental priors and expanding multimodal inputs.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

### [300] [A Unified Framework for Probabilistic Dynamic-, Trajectory- and Vision-based Virtual Fixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10239)
*Maximilian Mühlbauer,Freek Stulp,Sylvain Calinon,Alin Albu-Schäffer,João Silvério*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a probabilistic framework for adaptive haptic feedback, allowing seamless transitions between manual, semi-automated, and fully autonomous virtual fixtures (VFs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance task efficiency and flexibility by combining human precision with partial or full robotic automation, using haptic feedback informed by uncertainty.

Method: A unified probabilistic VF framework is developed with novel Dynamical System-based VFs, probabilistic trajectory fixtures, and extended visual servoing fixtures to match task requirements. Experimental validations are conducted on multiple robots.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates flexible integration between human manual control, semi-automation, and full autonomy across robotic tasks, showcasing geometry-awareness and optimal impedance behaviors.

Conclusion: The framework succeeds in offering enhanced adaptability, precision, and ease of use in varying robot-assisted tasks, ensuring both productivity and human control.

Abstract: Probabilistic Virtual Fixtures (VFs) enable the adaptive selection of the
most suitable haptic feedback for each phase of a task, based on learned or
perceived uncertainty. While keeping the human in the loop remains essential,
for instance, to ensure high precision, partial automation of certain task
phases is critical for productivity. We present a unified framework for
probabilistic VFs that seamlessly switches between manual fixtures,
semi-automated fixtures (with the human handling precise tasks), and full
autonomy. We introduce a novel probabilistic Dynamical System-based VF for
coarse guidance, enabling the robot to autonomously complete certain task
phases while keeping the human operator in the loop. For tasks requiring
precise guidance, we extend probabilistic position-based trajectory fixtures
with automation allowing for seamless human interaction as well as
geometry-awareness and optimal impedance gains. For manual tasks requiring very
precise guidance, we also extend visual servoing fixtures with the same
geometry-awareness and impedance behaviour. We validate our approach
experimentally on different robots, showcasing multiple operation modes and the
ease of programming fixtures.

*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel adaptive control algorithm for Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) ensuring stable operation even when 3D point features are outside the field of view.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IBVS techniques generally rely on detecting 3D point features within the field of view, which is limiting. This research seeks to overcome this limitation.

Method: The authors develop a feedforward-feedback adaptive control algorithm incorporating Youla Parameterization and an adaptive controller for real-time linearization of nonlinear camera and robot manipulator models.

Result: Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in various scenarios.

Conclusion: The control algorithm is robust, improves precision, and is easy to implement across industrial robotic systems, addressing limitations of existing IBVS methods.

Abstract: Image-based visual servoing (IBVS) methods have been well developed and used
in many applications, especially in pose (position and orientation) alignment.
However, most research papers focused on developing control solutions when 3D
point features can be detected inside the field of view. This work proposes an
innovative feedforward-feedback adaptive control algorithm structure with the
Youla Parameterization method. A designed feature estimation loop ensures
stable and fast motion control when point features are outside the field of
view. As 3D point features move inside the field of view, the IBVS feedback
loop preserves the precision of the pose at the end of the control period.
Also, an adaptive controller is developed in the feedback loop to stabilize the
system in the entire range of operations. The nonlinear camera and robot
manipulator model is linearized and decoupled online by an adaptive algorithm.
The adaptive controller is then computed based on the linearized model
evaluated at current linearized point. The proposed solution is robust and easy
to implement in different industrial robotic systems. Various scenarios are
used in simulations to validate the effectiveness and robust performance of the
proposed controller.

### [302] [A Novel Feedforward Youla Parameterization Method for Avoiding Local Minima in Stereo Image Based Visual Servoing Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10252)
*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses improved stereo camera pose estimation and accurate servoing by integrating feedforward and Youla feedback control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the issue of local minima affecting global stability in image-based visual servoing for accurate stereo camera positioning.

Method: Proposes a novel control strategy combining feedforward control with a Youla parameterization-based feedback controller to enhance servoing robustness.

Result: Simulations show the proposed method avoids local minima and achieves accurate, efficient positioning of the stereo camera.

Conclusion: The approach reliably improves servoing performance and global stability in stereo camera pose estimation and alignment tasks.

Abstract: In robot navigation and manipulation, accurately determining the camera's
pose relative to the environment is crucial for effective task execution. In
this paper, we systematically prove that this problem corresponds to the
Perspective-3-Point (P3P) formulation, where exactly three known 3D points and
their corresponding 2D image projections are used to estimate the pose of a
stereo camera. In image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control, the system
becomes overdetermined, as the 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) of the stereo camera
must align with 9 observed 2D features in the scene. When more constraints are
imposed than available DoFs, global stability cannot be guaranteed, as the
camera may become trapped in a local minimum far from the desired configuration
during servoing. To address this issue, we propose a novel control strategy for
accurately positioning a calibrated stereo camera. Our approach integrates a
feedforward controller with a Youla parameterization-based feedback controller,
ensuring robust servoing performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that
our method effectively avoids local minima and enables the camera to reach the
desired pose accurately and efficiently.

*Alexandre Capone,Ryan Cosner,Aaaron Ames,Sandra Hirche*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a safe learning-based control method that ensures system safety without needing a backup controller, even under high model uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety challenges in high-uncertainty control tasks where conventional safety filters may fail.

Method: Combine control barrier functions with on-the-fly exploration using Gaussian process bandit algorithm to collect relevant data and maintain safety.

Result: The approach guarantees safety in systems with high uncertainty, using only a zero-mean prior dynamics model and establishing feasibility without relying on backup controllers.

Conclusion: The method enhances safe learning-based control and is a novel contribution in handling tasks without backup controllers under significant model uncertainty.

Abstract: Control tasks with safety requirements under high levels of model uncertainty
are increasingly common. Machine learning techniques are frequently used to
address such tasks, typically by leveraging model error bounds to specify
robust constraint-based safety filters. However, if the learned model
uncertainty is very high, the corresponding filters are potentially invalid,
meaning no control input satisfies the constraints imposed by the safety
filter. While most works address this issue by assuming some form of safe
backup controller, ours tackles it by collecting additional data on the fly
using a Gaussian process bandit-type algorithm. We combine a control barrier
function with a learned model to specify a robust certificate that ensures
safety if feasible. Whenever infeasibility occurs, we leverage the control
barrier function to guide exploration, ensuring the collected data contributes
toward the closed-loop system safety. By combining a safety filter with
exploration in this manner, our method provably achieves safety in a setting
that allows for a zero-mean prior dynamics model, without requiring a backup
controller. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first safe learning-based
control method that achieves this.

TL;DR: The study introduces a multi-scale Bayesian optimization approach for controlling tearing instabilities in nuclear fusion plants by integrating a high-frequency dynamics model with a low-frequency Gaussian process, yielding significant improvements in both offline and live experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Control of nuclear fusion dynamics is challenging due to their complexity, scarcity of data, hardware failures, and long-lasting effects of experiments. Existing machine learning tools like reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization are insufficient for comprehensive solutions.

Method: A multi-scale Bayesian optimization approach combines a high-frequency data-driven dynamics model with a low-frequency Gaussian process. The Gaussian process is updated between experiments to adapt to new data and improve predictions.

Result: Offline testing demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines, and live experiments in the DIII-D tokamak achieve a 50% success rate, showing a 117% improvement over historical outcomes.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses challenges in controlling nuclear fusion dynamics and shows promise in improving outcomes for complex, real-world systems like nuclear fusion plants.

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms often struggle to control complex real-world
systems. In the case of nuclear fusion, these challenges are exacerbated, as
the dynamics are notoriously complex, data is poor, hardware is subject to
failures, and experiments often affect dynamics beyond the experiment's
duration. Existing tools like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and
Bayesian optimization address some of these challenges but fail to provide a
comprehensive solution. To overcome these limitations, we present a multi-scale
Bayesian optimization approach that integrates a high-frequency data-driven
dynamics model with a low-frequency Gaussian process. By updating the Gaussian
process between experiments, the method rapidly adapts to new data, refining
the predictions of the less reliable dynamical model. We validate our approach
by controlling tearing instabilities in the DIII-D nuclear fusion plant.
Offline testing on historical data shows that our method significantly
outperforms several baselines. Results on live experiments on the DIII-D
tokamak, conducted under high-performance plasma scenarios prone to
instabilities, shows a 50% success rate, marking a 117% improvement over
historical outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper enhances lane-topology prediction for autonomous vehicles by integrating road metadata and centerline encodings, yielding improved results in complex intersection scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve lane-topology prediction for autonomous navigation by leveraging road metadata encoded in natural language and design codes.

Method: Augment the SMERF model with structured road metadata from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and lane-width priors from road design manuals, in combination with road centerline encodings.

Result: Improved detection and association of lanes and traffic elements, demonstrated with diverse intersection scenarios using four topology-aware evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method generalizes well across varied topologies and conditions, showing promise for scalable application.

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

TL;DR: The paper explores multi-modal learning for robotic picking tasks using real-world data, particularly addressing challenges in unstructured environments like warehouses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Picking diverse items from clutter efficiently in real-world, unstructured settings is challenging for robotic manipulation; this work aims to enhance performance.

Method: Multi-modal visual encoding using RGB, depth, and semantic segmentation inputs; trained on real-world datasets with a multimodal pretrain-finetune approach.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation showed the approach's effectiveness across varied item-picking datasets, scenarios, and object types. Ablations highlighted the importance of pretraining and finetuning.

Conclusion: Multi-modal training improves robotic picking performance, with pretraining aiding in modality relationship learning for subset-based inference.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

*Daniel Betschinske,Malte Schrimpf,Steven Peters,Kamil Klonecki,Jan Peter Karch,Moritz Lippert*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper evaluates current methods, including novel and traditional approaches, to improve macroscopic safety validation for ADAS/ADS while identifying inherent limitations and emphasizing the indispensable role of Field Operational Testing (FOT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from inefficiencies and high costs associated with current Field Operational Testing (FOT) methods, particularly when testing higher automation levels, which demand adherence to ISO 21448 while maintaining practical quantification of residual risk.

Method: The authors reviewed state-of-the-art Reduction Approaches (RAs) for FOT, analyzed ISO 21448 to derive two argumentation models, and applied these models to an Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system. They used criteria like quantifiability, threats to validity, missing links, and black box compatibility to evaluate these methods.

Result: The evaluation showed promise in certain RAs but highlighted substantial shortcomings like missing links and threats to validity. No methods proved capable of replacing FOT entirely when addressing macroscopic safety validation needs.

Conclusion: While alternative approaches can improve FOT-based safety validation, none can fully substitute the crucial role of FOT. Further research is needed to mitigate the identified gaps and advance the efficiency of safety validation processes.

Abstract: The safety validation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and
Automated Driving Systems (ADS) increasingly demands efficient and reliable
methods to quantify residual risk while adhering to international standards
such as ISO 21448. Traditionally, Field Operational Testing (FOT) has been
pivotal for macroscopic safety validation of automotive driving functions up to
SAE automation level 2. However, state-of-the-art derivations for empirical
safety demonstrations using FOT often result in impractical testing efforts,
particularly at higher automation levels. Even at lower automation levels, this
limitation - coupled with the substantial costs associated with FOT - motivates
the exploration of approaches to enhance the efficiency of FOT-based
macroscopic safety validation. Therefore, this publication systematically
identifies and evaluates state-of-the-art Reduction Approaches (RAs) for FOT,
including novel methods reported in the literature. Based on an analysis of ISO
21448, two models are derived: a generic model capturing the argumentation
components of the standard, and a base model, exemplarily applied to Automatic
Emergency Braking (AEB) systems, establishing a baseline for the real-world
driving requirement for a Quantitative Safety Validation of Residual Risk
(QSVRR). Subsequently, the RAs are assessed using four criteria:
quantifiability, threats to validity, missing links, and black box
compatibility, highlighting potential benefits, inherent limitations, and
identifying key areas for further research. Our evaluation reveals that, while
several approaches offer potential, none are free from missing links or other
substantial shortcomings. Moreover, no identified alternative can fully replace
FOT, reflecting its crucial role in the safety validation of ADAS and ADS.

### [308] [RICE: Reactive Interaction Controller for Cluttered Canopy Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10383)
*Nidhi Homey Parayil,Thierry Peynot,Chris Lehnert*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reactive controller enabling robotic navigation in dense, cluttered, and deformable environments using tactile feedback, outperforming existing methods in safety, robustness, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots face challenges navigating agricultural canopies due to occlusions and fragile foliage; current vision-based or model-dependent methods are inadequate for safe and precise navigation in these settings.

Method: The authors developed a reactive controller integrating end-effector position and real-time tactile feedback to balance navigating around or pushing through obstacles in dynamic environments.

Result: In 35 trials across 3 experimental setups, the proposed controller successfully reached occluded targets without damaging branches and surpassed the performance of a state-of-the-art controller in robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for safe and adaptive robotic interaction in cluttered, contact-rich, deformable settings, with potential applications in agricultural tasks like pruning and harvesting.

Abstract: Robotic navigation in dense, cluttered environments such as agricultural
canopies presents significant challenges due to physical and visual occlusion
caused by leaves and branches. Traditional vision-based or model-dependent
approaches often fail in these settings, where physical interaction without
damaging foliage and branches is necessary to reach a target. We present a
novel reactive controller that enables safe navigation for a robotic arm in a
contact-rich, cluttered, deformable environment using end-effector position and
real-time tactile feedback. Our proposed framework's interaction strategy is
based on a trade-off between minimizing disturbance by maneuvering around
obstacles and pushing through them to move towards the target. We show that
over 35 trials in 3 experimental plant setups with an occluded target, the
proposed controller successfully reached the target in all trials without
breaking any branch and outperformed the state-of-the-art model-free controller
in robustness and adaptability. This work lays the foundation for safe,
adaptive interaction in cluttered, contact-rich deformable environments,
enabling future agricultural tasks such as pruning and harvesting in plant
canopies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how group-sensitive conversational design influences satisfaction and adaptability in multi-party interactions with socially interactive agents in real-world settings.

Method: The study used two social agents, a robot (Furhat) and a virtual agent (MetaHuman), equipped with conversational AI systems. Researchers conducted in-the-wild interactions with 188 participants at a museum, focusing on various group settings (dyads, triads, or larger).

Result: The study found no significant impact of group-sensitive conversation design on perceived satisfaction, but highlighted the challenges of improving multi-party interactions and adapting CAI across different agent embodiments.

Conclusion: Findings emphasize the need for multimodal strategies and provide valuable insights for advancing dialogue adaptation in multi-party interactions, contributing to fields like HAI, HRI, and HMI.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of a group-adaptive conversation design in
two socially interactive agents (SIAs) through two real-world studies. Both
SIAs - Furhat, a social robot, and MetaHuman, a virtual agent - were equipped
with a conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) backend combining hybrid
retrieval and generative models. The studies were carried out in an in-the-wild
setting with a total of $N = 188$ participants who interacted with the SIAs -
in dyads, triads or larger groups - at a German museum. Although the results
did not reveal a significant effect of the group-sensitive conversation design
on perceived satisfaction, the findings provide valuable insights into the
challenges of adapting CAI for multi-party interactions and across different
embodiments (robot vs.\ virtual agent), highlighting the need for multimodal
strategies beyond linguistic pluralization. These insights contribute to the
fields of Human-Agent Interaction (HAI), Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), and
broader Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), providing insights for future research
on effective dialogue adaptation in group settings.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a second-order inverse dynamics algorithm using spatial representation for efficiently computing derivatives of joint torques/forces for robotic arms and demonstrates it on the Franka Emika Panda robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance computational efficiency and compactness in calculating torques/forces for robotic control, particularly for flatness-based control in robotics.

Method: Introduces a Lie group-based spatial representation approach for a second-order inverse dynamics algorithm, along with a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm.

Result: Developed a computationally efficient algorithm that was successfully demonstrated on a 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot.

Conclusion: The spatial representation and Lie group parameterization improve efficiency while maintaining compactness in robotic control computations.

Abstract: Optimal control in general, and flatness-based control in particular, of
robotic arms necessitate to compute the first and second time derivatives of
the joint torques/forces required to achieve a desired motion. In view of the
required computational efficiency, recursive $O(n)$-algorithms were proposed to
this end. Aiming at compact yet efficient formulations, a Lie group formulation
was recently proposed, making use of body-fixed and hybrid representation of
twists and wrenches. In this paper a formulation is introduced using the
spatial representation. The second-order inverse dynamics algorithm is
accompanied by a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm. An
advantage of all Lie group formulations is that they can be parameterized in
terms of vectorial quantities that are readily available. The method is
demonstrated for the 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot.

*Yuhang Zhang,Haosheng Yu,Jiaping Xiao,Mir Feroskhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces VLFly, a VLN framework designed for UAVs, addressing generalization and discrete action space issues, using egocentric observations and continuous velocity commands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses two challenges in VLN research: poor generalization to new environments and dependence on fixed discrete action spaces, aiming to enable UAVs to navigate using human instructions.

Method: VLFly combines a language model-based instruction encoder, a vision-language model goal retriever, and a waypoint planner to provide real-time UAV navigation using images and continuous velocity commands.

Result: VLFly demonstrates superior navigation performance in diverse simulation tests compared to baselines, and shows robust understanding and navigation in real-world tasks with varying input complexities.

Conclusion: The study suggests that VLFly effectively generalizes navigation abilities for UAVs, handling abstract input and outperforming current methods, making it a significant advancement for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

*Felix Nonnengießer,Alap Kshirsagar,Boris Belousov,Jan Peters*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for robotic in-hand pose estimation by fusing visual and tactile data to overcome visual occlusion challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve pose estimation accuracy in robotic object manipulation, where visual occlusion limits the effectiveness of vision-based methods.

Method: A fusion approach combining data from a wrist-mounted RGB-D camera and tactile sensors using a weighting and fusion module. An augmented ICP algorithm is used for pose estimation.

Result: The method achieves an average pose estimation error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only baselines by up to 20%.

Conclusion: Incorporating tactile data enhances pose estimation accuracy, especially under occlusion, and enables precise object manipulation in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Accurate in-hand pose estimation is crucial for robotic object manipulation,
but visual occlusion remains a major challenge for vision-based approaches.
This paper presents an approach to robotic in-hand object pose estimation,
combining visual and tactile information to accurately determine the position
and orientation of objects grasped by a robotic hand. We address the challenge
of visual occlusion by fusing visual information from a wrist-mounted RGB-D
camera with tactile information from vision-based tactile sensors mounted on
the fingertips of a robotic gripper. Our approach employs a weighting and
sensor fusion module to combine point clouds from heterogeneous sensor types
and control each modality's contribution to the pose estimation process. We use
an augmented Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm adapted for weighted point
clouds to estimate the 6D object pose. Our experiments show that incorporating
tactile information significantly improves pose estimation accuracy,
particularly when occlusion is high. Our method achieves an average pose
estimation error of 7.5 mm and 16.7 degrees, outperforming vision-only
baselines by up to 20%. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to
perform precise object manipulation in a real-world insertion task.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAMA, a benchmark for handling defective and executable language instructions, coupled with RationalVLA, a model that outperforms others in robotic manipulation by combining high-level reasoning and low-level policy control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of language-conditioned robotic manipulation systems that assume perfectly aligned instructions, making them less robust and generalizable in real-world scenarios.

Method: Introduced RAMA, a benchmark with diverse instruction challenges, and proposed RationalVLA, a dual system model that integrates vision-language models with manipulation policies using learnable latent space embeddings.

Result: RationalVLA achieved superior performance on the RAMA benchmark, with a 14.5% higher success rate and validation in real-world trials.

Conclusion: RationalVLA enhances robustness and effectiveness in robotic manipulation by reasoning over ambiguous instructions and rejecting defective commands, marking an improvement over existing methodologies.

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for real-world robotic deployment is the ability to
understand and respond to natural language instructions. Existing
language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are
perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and
generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous,
irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional
MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen
executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we
construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective
instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion,
safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational
Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic
arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level
manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This
design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible
commands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that
RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher
success rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive
performance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate
its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Our project page is

### [315] [Invariant Extended Kalman Filter for Autonomous Surface Vessels with Partial Orientation Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10850)
*Derek Benham,Easton Potokar,Joshua G. Mangelson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) for better state estimation in autonomous surface vessels (ASVs), leveraging partial orientation from horizon sensing rather than full orientation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate state estimation, particularly vehicle pose, is critical for marine applications like seafloor mapping, as small deviations can lead to significant errors. Current methods assume access to full orientation measurements, which is often impractical in open ocean settings for ASVs.

Method: The authors developed an InEKF framework to integrate horizon-based roll and pitch observations alongside dual-antenna GPS heading measurements. These partial orientation data are used innovatively to improve state estimation without relying on full orientation.

Result: The framework was tested against traditional InEKF (using full orientation) and Multiplicative EKF (MEKF). It demonstrated higher robustness and accuracy in estimating ASV states using partial orientation data in open ocean environments.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel, effective approach for ASV state estimation by leveraging partial horizon-based orientation measurements, which are better suited for open-ocean operations than conventional full-orientation methods.

Abstract: Autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) are increasingly vital for marine science,
offering robust platforms for underwater mapping and inspection. Accurate state
estimation, particularly of vehicle pose, is paramount for precise seafloor
mapping, as even small surface deviations can have significant consequences
when sensing the seafloor below. To address this challenge, we propose an
Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) framework designed to integrate
partial orientation measurements. While conventional estimation often relies on
relative position measurements to fixed landmarks, open ocean ASVs primarily
observe a receding horizon. We leverage forward-facing monocular cameras to
estimate roll and pitch with respect to this horizon, which provides
yaw-ambiguous partial orientation information. To effectively utilize these
measurements within the InEKF, we introduce a novel framework for incorporating
such partial orientation data. This approach contrasts with traditional InEKF
implementations that assume full orientation measurements and is particularly
relevant for planar vehicle motion constrained to a "seafaring plane." This
paper details the developed InEKF framework; its integration with horizon-based
roll/pitch observations and dual-antenna GPS heading measurements for ASV state
estimation; and provides a comparative analysis against the InEKF using full
orientation and a Multiplicative EKF (MEKF). Our results demonstrate the
efficacy and robustness of the proposed partial orientation measurements for
accurate ASV state estimation in open ocean environments.

*Guanjin Wang,Xiangxue Zhao,Shapour Azarm,Balakumar Balachandran*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel data-driven modeling approach for analyzing robot motion in granular terrain, achieving significant computational reductions while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve computational efficiency and predictive capabilities in modeling robotic motion in granular terrains using data-driven techniques.

Method: The approach integrates Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition, Gaussian Process surrogate modeling, and Reduced Order Particle Filter for data assimilation, leveraging offline simulation and sparse experimental data.

Result: The proposed method achieves orders of magnitude reduction in computational time while maintaining comparable accuracy to simulations. It outperforms high-fidelity simulations for long-horizon predictions when experimental data are included.

Conclusion: The approach exhibits strong predictive capabilities and efficiency, making it suitable for robotic exploration in complex terrains, both online and offline.

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores how robotic performance and trust repair strategies impact human trust in robot-assisted delivery tasks, using a trust dynamics model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how to effectively manage and repair human trust in autonomous systems, particularly in robot-assisted delivery tasks.

Method: The study uses data from human participants and employs an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to analyze trust dynamics and human behavior. Trust repair strategies such as explanations and apologies are examined.

Result: Long explanations are found to be most effective for repairing trust after a failure, while denial is effective at preventing further trust loss. The trust estimates generated are shown to correlate with self-reported trust values.

Conclusion: The model can guide real-time adjustments to optimize human trust in autonomous systems.

Abstract: With increasing efficiency and reliability, autonomous systems are becoming
valuable assistants to humans in various tasks. In the context of
robot-assisted delivery, we investigate how robot performance and trust repair
strategies impact human trust. In this task, while handling a secondary task,
humans can choose to either send the robot to deliver autonomously or manually
control it. The trust repair strategies examined include short and long
explanations, apology and promise, and denial.
  Using data from human participants, we model human behavior using an
Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) to capture the dynamics of trust and
human action probabilities. Our findings indicate that humans are more likely
to deploy the robot autonomously when their trust is high. Furthermore, state
transition estimates show that long explanations are the most effective at
repairing trust following a failure, while denial is most effective at
preventing trust loss.
  We also demonstrate that the trust estimates generated by our model are
isomorphic to self-reported trust values, making them interpretable. This model
lays the groundwork for developing optimal policies that facilitate real-time
adjustment of human trust in autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient and precise repositioning of objects within a robotic gripper is challenging, prompting the need for innovative manipulation techniques.

Method: The method includes designing a vibration-based fingertip actuator, modeling sliding motion for clamped objects, and developing a motion planner to coordinate finger and vibration movements.

Result: Experiments show Vib2Move achieves final object positioning errors under 6 mm, proving its reliability across various planar objects.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel high-precision manipulation technique using micro-vibrations and gravity, advancing robotic in-hand reconfiguration capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce Vib2Move, a novel approach for in-hand object reconfiguration
that uses fingertip micro-vibrations and gravity to precisely reposition planar
objects. Our framework comprises three key innovations. First, we design a
vibration-based actuator that dynamically modulates the effective finger-object
friction coefficient, effectively emulating changes in gripping force. Second,
we derive a sliding motion model for objects clamped in a parallel gripper with
two symmetric, variable-friction contact patches. Third, we propose a motion
planner that coordinates end-effector finger trajectories and fingertip
vibrations to achieve the desired object pose. In real-world trials, Vib2Move
consistently yields final positioning errors below 6 mm, demonstrating
reliable, high-precision manipulation across a variety of planar objects. For

TL;DR: GenManip introduces a simulation platform for studying robotic manipulation generalization, using LLM-driven scene graphs and a benchmark to evaluate modular and end-to-end policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robotic manipulation struggles with robust policy generalization, particularly in adapting to diverse instructions and scenarios.

Method: The paper presents GenManip, which utilizes 3D object assets and LLM-driven scene synthesis to create diverse, realistic tasks, along with GenManip-Bench for systematic evaluations.

Result: Findings indicate that modular systems with foundation models achieve better generalization than end-to-end systems, despite data scaling benefits.

Conclusion: The GenManip platform is positioned as a valuable tool for furthering understanding and advancing policy generalization in realistic robotic manipulation settings.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in real-world settings remains challenging, especially
regarding robust generalization. Existing simulation platforms lack sufficient
support for exploring how policies adapt to varied instructions and scenarios.
Thus, they lag behind the growing interest in instruction-following foundation
models like LLMs, whose adaptability is crucial yet remains underexplored in
fair comparisons. To bridge this gap, we introduce GenManip, a realistic
tabletop simulation platform tailored for policy generalization studies. It
features an automatic pipeline via LLM-driven task-oriented scene graph to
synthesize large-scale, diverse tasks using 10K annotated 3D object assets. To
systematically assess generalization, we present GenManip-Bench, a benchmark of
200 scenarios refined via human-in-the-loop corrections. We evaluate two policy
types: (1) modular manipulation systems integrating foundation models for
perception, reasoning, and planning, and (2) end-to-end policies trained
through scalable data collection. Results show that while data scaling benefits
end-to-end methods, modular systems enhanced with foundation models generalize
more effectively across diverse scenarios. We anticipate this platform to
facilitate critical insights for advancing policy generalization in realistic
conditions. Project Page: https://genmanip.axi404.top/.

TL;DR: EyeRobot is a robotic system designed to enable hand-eye coordination using a mechanical eyeball and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robotic gaze system that actively observes and interacts with its environment, enabling effective manipulation for real-world tasks.

Method: A mechanical eyeball system controlled by a gaze policy is developed using reinforcement learning. Training is based on a BC-RL loop, combining teleoperated demonstrations with simulation environments for eye-hand coordination.

Result: When evaluated on five workspace manipulation tasks, EyeRobot demonstrated successful hand-eye coordination behaviors, enabling object tracking, distraction ignoring, and manipulation in wide workspaces.

Conclusion: The study highlights the feasibility of a foveal-inspired robotic gaze system, which benefits from coordination between hand and eye movements for efficient task performance.

Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order
to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system
with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We
develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings
and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We
accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a
360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports
rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze
on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the
hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye
observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct
action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks
towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements
a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small
compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable
fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.
We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring
manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest
EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate
manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera. See project site for

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TrioXpert is an end-to-end incident management framework leveraging multimodal data to address anomaly detection, failure triage, and root cause localization in large-scale microservice systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing incident management methods struggle with unimodal data limitations and fail to simultaneously handle multiple tasks with sufficient interpretability in microservice systems.

Method: TrioXpert integrates three independent multimodal data processing pipelines and utilizes large language models (LLMs) to collaboratively reason across tasks, offering interpretability via clear reasoning evidence.

Result: Experimental evaluations on two microservice system datasets show significant improvements across AD (4.7%-57.7%), FT (2.1%-40.6%), and RCL (1.6%-163.1%) tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: TrioXpert effectively enhances incident management by leveraging multimodal data and LLMs, proving its superiority in performance and interpretability across critical tasks in microservice systems.

Abstract: Automated incident management plays a pivotal role in large-scale
microservice systems. However, many existing methods rely solely on
single-modal data (e.g., metrics, logs, and traces) and struggle to
simultaneously address multiple downstream tasks, including anomaly detection
(AD), failure triage (FT), and root cause localization (RCL). Moreover, the
lack of clear reasoning evidence in current techniques often leads to
insufficient interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
TrioXpert, an end-to-end incident management framework capable of fully
leveraging multimodal data. TrioXpert designs three independent data processing
pipelines based on the inherent characteristics of different modalities,
comprehensively characterizing the operational status of microservice systems
from both numerical and textual dimensions. It employs a collaborative
reasoning mechanism using large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously handle
multiple tasks while providing clear reasoning evidence to ensure strong

microservice system datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that
TrioXpert achieves outstanding performance in AD (improving by 4.7% to 57.7%),
FT (improving by 2.1% to 40.6%), and RCL (improving by 1.6% to 163.1%) tasks.

*Francesco Vinci,Gyunam Park,Wil van der Aalst,Massimiliano de Leoni*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a streaming process simulation discovery approach that integrates Incremental Process Discovery and Online Machine Learning to adapt to evolving business processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing business process simulation techniques struggle to adapt to real-time changes in dynamic business environments, requiring a more adaptive approach.

Method: The approach combines Incremental Process Discovery with Online Machine Learning, emphasizing recent data while preserving historical information.

Result: Experiments on four event logs reveal the approach's ability to provide more stable simulations and handle concept drift effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed technique ensures adaptive, robust, and stable business process simulations suitable for dynamic operational environments.

Abstract: Business Process Simulation (BPS) refers to techniques designed to replicate
the dynamic behavior of a business process. Many approaches have been proposed
to automatically discover simulation models from historical event logs,
reducing the cost and time to manually design them. However, in dynamic
business environments, organizations continuously refine their processes to
enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Existing
techniques to process simulation discovery lack adaptability to real-time
operational changes. In this paper, we propose a streaming process simulation
discovery technique that integrates Incremental Process Discovery with Online
Machine Learning methods. This technique prioritizes recent data while
preserving historical information, ensuring adaptation to evolving process
dynamics. Experiments conducted on four different event logs demonstrate the
importance in simulation of giving more weight to recent data while retaining
historical knowledge. Our technique not only produces more stable simulations
but also exhibits robustness in handling concept drift, as highlighted in one
of the use cases.

### [323] [The Effects of GitHub Copilot on Computing Students' Programming Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Processes in Brownfield Programming Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10051)
*Md Istiak Hossain Shihab,Christopher Hundhausen,Ahsun Tariq,Summit Haque,Yunhan Qiao,Brian Mulanda*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study examines GitHub Copilot's impact on undergraduate students working on unfamiliar code bases, showing improved performance but raising concerns about understanding the AI's coding suggestions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how generative AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot affect student programmers in brownfield software development tasks.

Method: A controlled experiment with 10 undergraduate students working on similar tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application, analyzing performance, behavior, and conducting exit interviews.

Result: Students with Copilot completed tasks 35% faster, made 50% more progress, wrote code 11% less manually, and conducted 12% fewer web searches.

Conclusion: While Copilot improves task efficiency, it highlights the need for teaching methods that encourage understanding of AI-generated solutions in programming contexts.

Abstract: When graduates of computing degree programs enter the software industry, they
will most likely join teams working on legacy code bases developed by people
other than themselves. In these so-called brownfield software development
settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like
GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the
impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks
remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences
undergraduate students' programming performance, behaviors, and understanding
when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an
unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10
undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield
development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a
mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and
exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05)
and made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover,
our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time
manually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p
< 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in
programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not
understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the
need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that
leverage GenAI assistants' benefits while fostering reflection on how and why
GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks. Complete study results

### [324] [Reward Models Enable Scalable Code Verification by Trading Accuracy for Throughput](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10056)
*Gabriel Orlanski,Nicholas Roberts,Aws Albarghouthi,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores efficiency vs. accuracy for program ranking in coding tasks, proposing a generate-prune-then-rank method for faster verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the preference for comprehensive verifiers over outcome reward models (ORMs), and explore the trade-off in speed and accuracy.

Method: Introduce a generate-prune-then-rank approach: use a less accurate but faster verifier to eliminate incorrect solutions before ranking.

Result: The system achieves an 11.65x faster speed while sacrificing only 8.33% accuracy compared to using a full test suite.

Conclusion: ORMs are valuable for scalable systems, enabling faster yet still effective verification processes in program ranking.

Abstract: The standard paradigm for solving coding tasks via large language models
(LLMs) is to generate-then-rank programs, where the latter step uses a verifier
in the ranking process. The growing consensus is that a comprehensive verifier
(e.g., a full test suite) should be prioritized over an outcome reward model
(ORM) whenever possible, with little consideration given to the trade-offs
involved. We aim to challenge this assumption by systematically exploring the
tradeoff between speed and accuracy. We find that ORMs play a crucial role in
scaling verification through trading accuracy for speed, even when a
comprehensive verifier is available. Their value becomes especially apparent
when used in a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less
accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking -- leading to a
system that is 11.65x faster while only being 8.33% less accurate than the full
test suite. We analyze the generate-prune-then-rank approach and show that it
works by filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions. These findings
enable the design of scalable and accurate program ranking systems.

### [325] [Prompt Variability Effects On LLM Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10204)
*Andrei Paleyes,Radzim Sendyka,Diana Robinson,Christian Cabrera,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents methods to evaluate how sensitive large language models (LLMs) are to input variations in code generation, considering user backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used for code generation, but the quality of the code output often depends on the quality of prompts and the user's background knowledge. A method to analyze this sensitivity is needed to improve model reliability across diverse user profiles.

Method: The authors propose two methods: (1) A synthetic evaluation pipeline for analyzing code generation, and (2) A persona-based evaluation framework to understand qualitative differences in LLM outputs depending on user backgrounds. These methods are model-agnostic and programming-task independent.

Result: The study experimentally demonstrates the utility of the proposed evaluation methods and underscores their broad applicability. Additionally, the related code is shared for community use.

Conclusion: The proposed synthetic evaluation and persona-based methods facilitate systematic analysis of LLM performance in code generation and highlight qualitative differences influenced by user context. These contributions advance understanding of LLM sensitivities in practical applications.

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

*Ryan Gibb,Patrick Ferris,David Allsopp,Michael Winston Dales,Mark Elvers,Thomas Gazagnaire,Sadiq Jaffer,Thomas Leonard,Jon Ludlam,Anil Madhavapeddy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HyperRes is a cross-ecosystem dependency resolution system that uses hypergraphs to model and solve constraints across diverse package management systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current package manager systems for different languages and platforms lack interoperability, creating issues in multi-lingual projects where precise cross-ecosystem dependencies are needed.

Method: The authors propose HyperRes, a formal hypergraph-based system, to describe and solve versioned dependency resolution. They also define translations for dozens of existing package managers into HyperRes.

Result: Their approach enables dependency resolution across distinct ecosystems without requiring users to switch their package managers.

Conclusion: HyperRes provides a general framework to support multi-ecosystem dependency resolution by facilitating translation between existing package managers and adapting to specific deployment environments.

Abstract: Package managers are everywhere, with seemingly every language and operating
system implementing their own solution. The lack of interoperability between
these systems means that multi-lingual projects are unable to express precise
dependencies across language ecosystems, and external system and hardware
dependencies are typically implicit and unversioned. We define HyperRes, a
formal system for describing versioned dependency resolution using a hypergraph
that is expressive enough to model many ecosystems and solve dependency
constraints across them. We define translations from dozens of existing package
managers to HyperRes and comprehensively demonstrate that dependency resolution
can work across ecosystems that are currently distinct. This does not require
users to shift their choice of package managers; instead, HyperRes allows for
the translation of packaging metadata between ecosystems, and for solving to be
precisely specialised to a particular deployment environment.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using containerized Virtual Platforms and open-source technologies for fast, scalable, and cloud-based testing in HW/SW systems, demonstrated via an AI accelerator case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware availability for early software development often falls short in complex HW/SW systems, especially in automotive safety-critical domains. This study aims to overcome these challenges for better HW/SW co-development.

Method: The authors encapsulate Virtual Platforms in containers to reduce environmental dependencies, enable cloud-based execution, and leverage open-source technologies like QEMU and VCML instead of proprietary solutions.

Result: The proposed method was demonstrated with an AI accelerator VP case study, showing its ability to streamline testing and software execution pre-silicon in parallel environments.

Conclusion: The containerized VP approach provides a scalable, cost-effective, and practical solution for HW/SW co-development, addressing key challenges in testing and system complexity.

Abstract: The ever-increasing complexity of HW/SW systems presents a persistent
challenge, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive, where
extensive testing is imperative. However, the availability of hardware often
lags behind, hindering early-stage software development. To address this,
Virtual Platforms (VPs) based on the SystemC TLM-2.0 standard have emerged as a
pivotal solution, enabling pre-silicon execution and testing of unmodified
target software. In this study, we propose an approach leveraging
containerization to encapsulate VPs in order to reduce environment dependencies
and enable cloud deployment for fast, parallelized test execution, as well as
open-source VP technologies such as QEMU and VCML to obviate the need for seat
licenses. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) accelerator VP case study. Through our research, we offer a
robust solution to address the challenges posed by the complexity of HW/SW
systems, with practical implications for accelerating HW/SW co-development.

### [329] [Minimizing False Positives in Static Bug Detection via LLM-Enhanced Path Feasibility Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10322)
*Xueying Du,Kai Yu,Chong Wang,Yi Zou,Wentai Deng,Zuoyu Ou,Xin Peng,Lingming Zhang,Yiling Lou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM4PFA, a framework to enhance static bug detection by reducing false positives using LLM-based iterative path feasibility analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static bug analyzers face challenges with high false positive rates due to limitations in path feasibility validation for complex codebases.

Method: LLM4PFA uses an LLM-based iterative path feasibility analysis framework with targeted constraint reasoning and context-aware agent planning.

Result: LLM4PFA reduces false positives in bug detection by 72%-96%, outperforming other methods by up to 105.7%. It only missed 3 true positives out of 45.

Conclusion: LLM4PFA improves static bug detection significantly, demonstrating better effectiveness and scalability as compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Static bug analyzers play a crucial role in ensuring software quality.
However, existing analyzers for bug detection in large codebases often suffer
from high false positive rates. This is primarily due to the limited
capabilities of analyzers in path feasibility validation with multiple
conditional branches and complex data dependencies. While current LLM-based
approaches attempt to address this issue, their effectiveness remains limited
due to insufficient constraint cascade analysis and scalability challenges in
large projects. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative path
feasibility analysis framework LLM4PFA. By leveraging LLM agent based targeted
constraint reasoning, and key context-aware analysis driven by agent planning,
LLM4PFA effectively enhances complex inter-procedural path feasibility analysis
for minimizing false positives in static bug detection. Evaluation results show
that LLM4PFA precisely filters out 72% to 96% false positives reported during
static bug detection, significantly outperforming all the baselines by 41.1% -
105.7% improvements; meanwhile LLM4PFA only misses 3 real bugs of 45 true
positives.

*Seyed Moein Abtahi,Akramul Azim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores combining Large Language Models, static analysis, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to detect and improve code quality in software projects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address common software development issues such as bugs and inefficiencies by automating code revision workflows, leveraging AI advances.

Method: The study used static analysis to detect code issues, iterative prompt engineering for customized LLM outputs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation for accurate revisions, supported by a code comparison app to reduce errors.

Result: Significant reduction in code issues through iterative automated revisions and enhanced workflows, optimizing resources and improving code structure.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs, RAG, and code comparison tools is effective in enhancing code quality and streamlining the software development process.

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

Motivation: The need for a standardized evaluation tool to assess geospatial code generation by LLMs and improve the integration of artificial intelligence in geo-scientific analysis.

Method: AutoGEEval++ is built on the GEE Python API and uses a benchmark dataset called AutoGEEval++-Bench. It includes an automated pipeline for code generation and execution validation with multi-dimensional metrics for evaluating model performance.

Result: Evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs showed distinct differences in performance, stability, and errors across task types and settings, validating AutoGEEval++'s value and scalability.

Conclusion: AutoGEEval++ establishes the first standardized evaluation protocol and benchmark for GEE-based LLM code generation, offering a robust framework for domain-specific systematic assessments.

Abstract: Geospatial code generation is becoming a key frontier in integrating
artificial intelligence with geo-scientific analysis, yet standardised
automated evaluation tools for this task remain absent. This study presents
AutoGEEval++, an enhanced framework building on AutoGEEval, and the first
automated assessment system for large language models (LLMs) generating
geospatial code on Google Earth Engine (GEE). It supports diverse data
modalities and varying task complexities. Built on the GEE Python API,
AutoGEEval++ features a benchmark dataset-AutoGEEval++-Bench-with 6,365 test
cases across 26 data types and three task categories: unit, combo, and theme
tests. It includes a submission programme and a judge module to realise an
end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline from code generation to
execution-based validation. The framework adopts multi-dimensional
metrics-accuracy, resource usage, run-time efficiency, and error
types-balancing hallucination control and efficiency, and enabling boundary
testing and error pattern analysis. Using AutoGEEval++, we evaluate 24
state-of-the-art LLMs (as of June 2025), including general-purpose,
reasoning-enhanced, code-centric, and geoscience-specific models. Results
reveal clear performance, stability, and error differences across task types,
model designs, and deployment settings, confirming AutoGEEval++'s practical
value and scalability in vertical-domain code generation. This work establishes
the first standardised evaluation protocol and foundational benchmark for
GEE-based LLM code generation, providing a unified basis for performance
comparison and a methodological framework for systematic, domain-specific code
evaluation.

### [332] [MLLM-Based UI2Code Automation Guided by UI Layout Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10376)
*Fan Wu,Cuiyun Gao,Shuqing Li,Xin-Cheng Wen,Qing Liao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LayoutCoder is a framework for transforming UI images into code using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), addressing limitations of prior methods in real-world generalization and layout accuracy. It demonstrates superior performance with a new benchmark dataset, showing notable improvements in BLEU and CLIP scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating the UI2Code conversion process is essential to reduce the time and effort required for website development. Current deep learning-based methods struggle with generalizing to real-world scenarios and preserving complex UI layouts.

Method: The LayoutCoder framework introduces three modules: Element Relation Construction for identifying and grouping similar components, UI Layout Parsing for generating layout trees, and Layout-Guided Code Fusion for producing layout-preserved code. It is evaluated using a newly created Snap2Code benchmark dataset.

Result: LayoutCoder outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 10.14% improvement in BLEU scores and a 3.95% improvement in CLIP scores on average across all datasets evaluated, including the new Snap2Code dataset.

Conclusion: LayoutCoder effectively leverages MLLMs to address challenges in UI layout comprehension and real-world code generation. Its architecture, coupled with the Snap2Code benchmark, demonstrates its robustness and efficacy over competing approaches.

Abstract: Converting user interfaces into code (UI2Code) is a crucial step in website
development, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The automation of
UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the
development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task;
however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and
struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating
the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and
generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we
propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from
real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element
Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and
grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims
at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation
process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the
accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark
dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into
seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the
popular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior
performance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with
the best-performing baseline, LayoutCoder improves 10.14% in the BLEU score and
3.95% in the CLIP score on average across all datasets.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a rule-based automated framework for classifying quantum software bugs by various parameters, achieving up to 85.21% accuracy and highlighting quantum-specific issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance software quality by accurately categorizing bugs, particularly in quantum software, to aid developers in addressing quality challenges.

Method: The framework employs keyword and heuristic-based techniques for bug classification and is validated against a manual classification of 4,984 issues from 12,910 Qiskit repository issues.

Result: The automated classifications showed substantial agreement for most parameters, with F1-scores ranging from 0.7075 to 0.8393. Analysis revealed an overlap of classical (67.2%) and quantum-specific (27.3%) bugs, with usability, maintainability, and interoperability being the most affected quality attributes.

Conclusion: The rule-based approach is effective for bug classification, though improvements are needed, particularly in severity classification. The framework provides insights into quantum-specific bug trends and their impacts on software quality.

Abstract: Accurate classification of software bugs is essential for improving software
quality. This paper presents a rule-based automated framework for classifying
issues in quantum software repositories by bug type, category, severity, and
impacted quality attributes, with additional focus on quantum-specific bug
types. The framework applies keyword and heuristic-based techniques tailored to
quantum computing. To assess its reliability, we manually classified a
stratified sample of 4,984 issues from a dataset of 12,910 issues across 36
Qiskit repositories. Automated classifications were compared with ground truth
using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework achieved up to
85.21% accuracy, with F1-scores ranging from 0.7075 (severity) to 0.8393
(quality attribute). Statistical validation via paired t-tests and Cohen's
Kappa showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for bug type (k = 0.696),
category (k = 0.826), quality attribute (k = 0.818), and quantum-specific bug
type (k = 0.712). Severity classification showed slight agreement (k = 0.162),
suggesting room for improvement. Large-scale analysis revealed that classical
bugs dominate (67.2%), with quantum-specific bugs at 27.3%. Frequent bug
categories included compatibility, functional, and quantum-specific defects,
while usability, maintainability, and interoperability were the most impacted
quality attributes. Most issues (93.7%) were low severity; only 4.3% were
critical. A detailed review of 1,550 quantum-specific bugs showed that over
half involved quantum circuit-level problems, followed by gate errors and
hardware-related issues.

*Xiao Yu,Haoxuan Chen,Feifei Niu,Xing Hu,Jacky Wai Keung,Xin Xia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 308 fixed bugs in distributed training and inference frameworks to understand their characteristics, fixing efforts, and implications for automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve debugging and repair methods for distributed training frameworks, as their complexity can lead to performance issues, resource waste, and failures.

Method: A large-scale empirical analysis was conducted on bug symptoms, root causes, fixing efforts, and strategies across three frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI.

Result: The study identified unique bug causes due to distribution, observed that 48% of fixes required minimal code changes, and offered insights into automation potential in debugging/repair processes.

Conclusion: The findings help improve the reliability of distributed frameworks and LLMs, highlight automation opportunities, and recommend practices for debugging and repairing such frameworks.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), distributed
training and inference frameworks like DeepSpeed have become essential for
scaling model training and inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. However,
the increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs,
which may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result
in significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is
fundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective
debugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale
empirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed
training/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We
examine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and
common low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of
these frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy
error and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs
remains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and
root causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component
interactions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal
code changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic
optimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility
handling, indicating potential for automation. Based on these insights, we
offer several implications for improving the reliability of both distributed
training and inference frameworks and their dependent LLM projects, while also
identifying opportunities to leverage LLM-based tools for automated debugging
and repair.

*Fangwen Mu,Junjie Wang,Lin Shi,Song Wang,Shoubin Li,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExpeRepair, an approach that employs dual memory systems inspired by human cognition to improve software issue repair using Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses the limitations of isolated issue resolutions and static prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the fundamental challenges in automatic software issue repair and address limitations in LLM-based methods, such as neglecting historical repair insights and rigid prompting strategies.

Method: ExpeRepair uses dual-channel knowledge accumulation, combining episodic memory (concrete repair demonstrations) and semantic memory (abstract reflective insights). Relevant repair experiences are dynamically integrated into context-aware prompts during inference.

Result: ExpeRepair demonstrated a pass@1 score of 49.3% on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using Claude 3.7 Sonnet, outperforming other open-source methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that leveraging dual memory systems enhances adaptability and repair performance, marking a significant improvement over existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Automatically repairing software issues remains a fundamental challenge at
the intersection of software engineering and AI. Although recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for
repository-level repair tasks, current methodologies exhibit two notable
limitations: (1) they often address issues in isolation, neglecting to
incorporate insights from previously resolved issues, and (2) they rely on
static and rigid prompting strategies, which constrain their ability to
generalize across diverse and evolving issue scenarios. Inspired by the dual
memory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work
synergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose
ExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical
repair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair
organizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an
episodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic
memory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair
activates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from

It further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition,

### [336] [BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501)
*Surya Jasper,Minh Luu,Evan Pan,Aakash Tyagi,Michael Quinn,Jiang Hu,David Kebo Houngninou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces BugGen, an autonomous pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate, insert, and validate realistic bugs in RTL, significantly improving verification efficiency over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing hardware complexity makes debugging resource-intensive, necessitating scalable machine learning-based approaches, which require diverse and realistic bug datasets lacking in current methodologies.

Method: BugGen employs Large Language Models (LLMs) within a multi-agent pipeline to divide modules, select targets, and iteratively refine and roll back changes to generate syntactically correct, functionally detectable bugs in RTL.

Result: BugGen generated 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy across five OpenTitan IP blocks, achieving a runtime throughput five times faster than manual methods while revealing undetected bugs and exposing verification gaps.

Conclusion: BugGen offers a scalable and efficient approach to generating high-quality bug datasets, improving verification processes, and supporting ML-assisted debugging.

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

### [337] [AdaptiveLLM: A Framework for Selecting Optimal Cost-Efficient LLM for Code-Generation Based on CoT Length](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10525)
*Junhang Cheng,Fang Liu,Chengru Wu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AdaptiveLLM, a framework for selecting optimal LLMs in code generation tasks, improves performance by 7.86% while cutting resource consumption by 88.9%, using automatic task difficulty assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiency and performance balance in LLM-based code generation is crucial, but existing approaches neglect cost-effectiveness and rely on inaccessible human difficulty labels.

Method: AdaptiveLLM dynamically assesses task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) lengths clustered into levels via k-means, embeds features with fine-tuned CodeBERT, and employs an XGBoost classifier for model selection.

Result: Experimental findings show 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score and 88.9% reduction in resources compared to baseline methods, with significant reliability in difficulty assessment.

Conclusion: AdaptiveLLM provides a cost-efficient and reliable framework for LLM optimization in coding tasks, outperforming human-based difficulty evaluation approaches and improving coding accuracy.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code
generation efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance
and inference costs across diverse programming tasks. Dynamically selecting the
optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a
promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and
performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive
and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on
human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in
real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task
difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that
dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically
assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using
Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into
three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed
difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best
model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental
results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score
while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method
ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an
approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of
cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides
more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation. Our replication package
is available at https://github.com/cjhCoder7/AdaptiveLLM.

### [338] [Not One to Rule Them All: Mining Meaningful Code Review Orders From GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10654)
*Abir Bouraffa,Carolin Brandt,Andy Zaidmann,Walid Maalej*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study analyzed the order in which developers review pull requests on GitHub, finding that 44.6% deviate from the default alphabetical order to use meaningful navigation sequences like largest-diff-first or test-first strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how developers navigate and comment on files during code reviews in pull requests and identify patterns in their strategies beyond alphabetical file order.

Method: Analyzed code review comments from 23,241 pull requests across 100 popular Java and Python repositories, examining the sequence of file navigation and commenting during reviews.

Result: 44.6% of pull requests were reviewed in a non-alphabetical order. Different patterns emerged, including 20.6% using largest-diff-first, 17.6% following file similarity to the pull request's description, and 29% following a test-first order. Non-alphabetical reviews covered more files but received fewer approvals.

Conclusion: Reviewers often adopt varied and meaningful strategies when navigating files in pull requests, suggesting that tools providing additional organizational support could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of code reviews.

Abstract: Developers use tools such as GitHub pull requests to review code, discuss
proposed changes, and request modifications. While changed files are commonly
presented in alphabetical order, this does not necessarily coincide with the
reviewer's preferred navigation sequence. This study investigates the different
navigation orders developers follow while commenting on changes submitted in
pull requests. We mined code review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100
popular Java and Python repositories on GitHub to analyze the order in which
the reviewers commented on the submitted changes. Our analysis shows that for
44.6% of pull requests, the reviewers comment in a non-alphabetical order.
Among these pull requests, we identified traces of alternative meaningful
orders: 20.6% (2,134) followed a largest-diff-first order, 17.6% (1,827) were
commented in the order of the files' similarity to the pull request's title and
description, and 29% (1,188) of pull requests containing changes to both
production and test files adhered to a test-first order. We also observed that
the proportion of reviewed files to total submitted files was significantly
higher in non-alphabetically ordered reviews, which also received slightly
fewer approvals from reviewers, on average. Our findings highlight the need for
additional support during code reviews, particularly for larger pull requests,
where reviewers are more likely to adopt complex strategies rather than
following a single predefined order.

### [340] [From Tea Leaves to System Maps: Context-awareness in Monitoring Operational Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10770)
*Joran Leest,Claudia Raibulet,Patricia Lago,Ilias Gerostathopoulos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of shared understanding regarding the role of contextual information in ML monitoring and introduces a framework (C-SAR) for structuring such information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the fact that ML systems in production fail not due to input statistical anomalies but due to contextual misalignment, which current monitoring techniques fail to properly address given their focus on statistical shifts instead of meaningful context.

Method: The authors systematically reviewed 94 studies across disciplines and developed the C-SAR framework, which organizes contextual information in ML monitoring. They also identified 20 reusable patterns related to system representation and monitoring activities.

Result: The study introduced the C-SAR framework, which organizes contextual information and maps it to monitoring activities, providing clarity on how to leverage contextual data for ML monitoring purposes.

Conclusion: This research shifts the focus of ML monitoring from statistical observations to a holistic system-context-based approach, offering systematic and reliable monitoring practices for ML systems.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models in production do not fail due to statistical
anomalies in their input data; they fail due to contextual misalignment -- when
their environment deviates from training assumptions, leading to unreliable
predictions. Effective ML monitoring requires rich contextual information to
move beyond detecting statistical shifts toward meaningful alerts and
systematic root-cause analysis. Yet, surprisingly, despite extensive research
in ML monitoring and related disciplines (drift detection, data validation,
out-of-distribution detection), there is no shared understanding of how to use
contextual information -- striking, given that monitoring involves
interpretation of information in context. In response, this paper presents a
systematic review to characterize and structure the various types of contextual
information in this domain. Our analysis examines 94 primary studies across
data mining, databases, software engineering, and ML. We introduce the
Contextual System--Aspect--Representation (C-SAR) framework, a conceptual model
that synthesizes our findings. We also identify 20 recurring and potentially
reusable patterns of specific system, aspect, and representation combinations,
and map them to the monitoring activities they support. This study provides a
new perspective on ML monitoring: from interpreting "tea leaves" of
observational statistics into constructing and managing "system maps" that
enable systematic and reliable ML monitoring practices.

*Vinaik Chhetri,Krishna Upadhyay,A. B. Siddique,Umar Farooq*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study analyzes user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps, utilizing a dataset including 292 apps and 894,000 reviews. It establishes a detailed analysis pipeline validated for precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how users perceive and critique AI features in mobile apps, given the large volume of unprocessed feedback.

Method: The study uses a multi-stage, validated analysis pipeline with human-labeled benchmarks and large language models to classify, extract, and cluster sentiments from user reviews.

Result: The pipeline identifies over one million aspect-sentiment pairs, grouped into 33 user topics, exposing themes of user satisfaction and frustration.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates scalable, nuanced analysis of real-world user experiences, uncovering universal and domain-specific feedback trends.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

*Fabian C. Peña,Steffen Herbold*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces SELU, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on 17 non-code software engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the unexplored area of applying LLMs beyond code understanding and generation, particularly in non-code software engineering tasks.

Method: The authors fine-tuned 22 open-source LLMs, prompted two proprietary models, and trained two baselines to evaluate their performance across tasks using classification, regression, NER, and MLM targets.

Result: Moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently performed best, showing high average performance and stability across tasks, while code-focused pre-training offered limited improvements.

Conclusion: SELU benchmark provides insights into model selection for non-code software engineering tasks and suggests areas for further research in generative and design-focused scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code understanding and generation; however, their effectiveness on non-code
Software Engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. We present the first
comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language
Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from
identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating
the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification,
regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue
tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs,
prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is
measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and
compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that
moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting
high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via
code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights
guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for
expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.

*Quinn Thibeault,Giulia Pedrielli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiCoSim, a Python-based framework for flexible and modular co-simulation of cyber-physical systems (CPS), addressing limitations in current simulation tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber-physical systems are growing in complexity and require rapid, accurate simulation for development, while current tools lack flexibility, portability, and automation for co-simulation.

Method: The authors proposed MultiCoSim, a Python-based framework enabling programmatic definition, composition, and configuration of simulation components, allowing distributed and modular co-simulation.

Result: Case studies demonstrate MultiCoSim's effectiveness in co-simulating custom and off-the-shelf platforms, such as automaton-based controllers and PX4 autopilot for robotics.

Conclusion: MultiCoSim improves the flexibility and reusability of CPS simulation pipelines, addressing key challenges in modularity and integration for research and development.

Abstract: Simulation is a foundational tool for the analysis and testing of
cyber-physical systems (CPS), underpinning activities such as algorithm
development, runtime monitoring, and system verification. As CPS grow in
complexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled
settings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of
simulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software,
and physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of
heterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances
in high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in
diverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the
development of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for
automated and comparative evaluation.
  Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation
support, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are
configured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation
components are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly
compose systems or integrate components across platforms.
  To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based
simulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure
simulation components programmatically. MultiCoSim supports distributed,
component-based co-simulation and allows seamless substitution and
reconfiguration of components. We demonstrate the flexibility of MultiCoSim
through case studies that include co-simulations involving custom
automaton-based controllers, as well as integration with off-the-shelf
platforms like the PX4 autopilot for aerial robotics. These examples highlight
MultiCoSim's capability to streamline CPS simulation pipelines for research and
development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline for creating large-scale datasets for GitHub issue resolution tasks, efficiently addressing major challenges and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to streamline and automate the labor-intensive process of constructing large-scale GitHub issue resolution datasets, which is crucial for evaluating and training Large Language Models in software engineering.

Method: The authors propose SWE-Factory, a three-component pipeline: SWE-Builder for automating evaluation environments, an exit-code-based grading method to replace manual parsers, and automated fail2pass validation leveraging exit code signals.

Result: Experiments across 671 issues in multiple programming languages show SWE-Builder constructs valid task instances at a low cost, exit-code grading achieves 100% accuracy, and fail2pass validation achieves a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00.

Conclusion: SWE-Factory significantly reduces effort and cost in dataset construction for GitHub issue resolution tasks, ensuring high-quality, large-scale datasets for both training and evaluation of LLMs.

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at
https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.

*Seyed Amir Hossein Saberi,Amir Najafi,Abolfazl Motahari,Babak H. khalaj*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper establishes sample complexity bounds for learning high-dimensional simplices in the presence of Gaussian noise, providing both upper and lower bounds while introducing novel methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the sample requirements and effective methods for learning high-dimensional simplices from noisy data is important for foundational and practical advances in statistical learning.

Method: The authors provide sample complexity bounds, including information-theoretic lower bounds, and introduce a Fourier-based method along with leveraging sample compression techniques for noisy observation recovery.

Result: The authors derive bounds for noisy and noiseless scenarios, showing alignment of complexity when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high (≥Ω(K^(1/2))).

Conclusion: The paper resolves an open question regarding complexity alignment in noisy and noiseless cases and introduces methodologies that may extend beyond simplex learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

*Panagiotis Theodoropoulos,Augustinos D. Saravanos,Evangelos A. Theodorou,Guan-Horng Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3MSBM, a novel framework addressing the challenge of inferring complex system trajectories with temporal dependencies from sparse snapshots, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations of current interpolation methods, which struggle to capture long-range dependencies, affecting trajectory coherence in various domains such as biology, meteorology, and economics.

Method: 3MSBM leverages multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal control problems by lifting dynamics to phase space and minimizing a variational objective to learn smooth measure-valued splines, preserving intermediate marginals.

Result: 3MSBM achieves superior performance in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies across various real-world applications, showcasing improved convergence and scalability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable and accurate solution for trajectory inference, offering new possibilities for matching frameworks in multi-marginal settings.

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

*Moïse Blanchard,Samory Kpotufe*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores distributionally constrained adversaries to bridge the continuum from adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, offering a general framework for learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To gain a finer understanding of learning conditions between fully adversarial and fully stochastic regimes, especially under constrained distribution classes.

Method: The paper provides a general framework to characterize learnable distribution classes against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries.

Result: It generalizes learnability for smoothed settings and demonstrates learning feasibility for natural function classes like linear classifiers without needing prior distribution knowledge.

Conclusion: The framework enhances understanding of interactions between function classes and adversary constraints, enabling effective online learning in hybrid settings.

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

*Florian Handke,Félix Koulischer,Gabriel Raya,Luca Ambrogioni*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes an approach to identify when semantic class decisions emerge during diffusion-based generative processes, using an information-theoretic framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen the understanding of how and when semantic features arise dynamically during diffusion processes, linked to physical phase transitions.

Method: The authors use an information-theoretic method based on conditional entropy calculations and its time derivative to analyze information transfer during diffusion.

Result: Tests on Gaussian mixture models and CIFAR10 dataset show semantic decisions peak in intermediate diffusion stages but vary significantly across classes.

Conclusion: Different semantic decisions occur at diverse intermediate stages, shedding light on the dynamics of generative diffusion models.

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

TL;DR: The proposed BCSoftmax explicitly enforces box constraints on softmax output probabilities and improves calibration metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to enforce hard constraints on output probabilities, particularly for applications requiring trustworthy and reliable decisions.

Method: BCSoftmax function is introduced as a box-constrained optimization solution, along with an efficient computation algorithm and post-hoc calibration methods.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates effectiveness using datasets like TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups, showcasing improvements in calibration metrics.

Conclusion: BCSoftmax enables direct control of probability constraints and enhances predictive model reliability for decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

### [350] [Logarithmic Smoothing for Adaptive PAC-Bayesian Off-Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10664)
*Maxime Haddouche,Otmane Sakhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper extends PAC-Bayesian learning with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) from static to adaptive off-policy learning, showing improved performance and faster convergence in iterative policy refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the practical limitations of static off-policy learning by exploring adaptive off-policy learning, enabling iterative policy refinement and higher-quality data collection.

Method: The authors utilize PAC-Bayesian learning with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS), extending it to adaptive situations via online PAC-Bayesian theory, and performing a principled adjustment to the LS estimator to account for multiple deployments.

Result: The proposed method achieves faster convergence rates under mild conditions and outperforms leading offline approaches, particularly when intermediate policy deployments are allowed.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of combining adaptive data collection with PAC-Bayesian formulations, achieving superior performance in both static and adaptive settings.

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

### [351] [Practical Improvements of A/B Testing with Off-Policy Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10677)
*Sakhi Otmane,Gilotte Alexandre,Rohde David*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new estimator for A/B testing that significantly reduces variance without compromising unbiasedness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the commonly used difference-in-means method in A/B testing, which, while unbiased, suffers from high variance.

Method: The authors introduce and analyze a family of unbiased off-policy estimators to achieve variance reduction and identify the one with the lowest variance.

Result: The proposed estimator demonstrates substantial variance reduction and retains simplicity compared to the standard method, particularly when the tested systems are similar.

Conclusion: The theoretical and experimental results confirm the practicality and effectiveness of the improved estimator for A/B testing.

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit
similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

*Dimitri Meunier,Antoine Moulin,Jakub Wornbard,Vladimir R. Kostic,Arthur Gretton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper presents a analysis of causal effect estimation using nonparametric instrumental variable regression with spectral features, introducing a taxonomy of success scenarios and performance limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance the understanding of causal effect estimation in settings with hidden confounders, particularly by examining the performance and limitations of spectral feature-based methods in this context.

Method: The researchers derive generalization error bounds for two-stage least squares estimators using spectral features, classify scenarios affecting performance based on spectral alignment and eigenvalue decay, and validate their findings through synthetic experiments.

Result: They identify three distinct performance scenarios—optimal, requiring more samples, and failure—based on the alignment of structural functions with eigenfunctions and eigenvalue behaviors.

Conclusion: The study provides a clear taxonomy of outcomes for spectral feature-based causal effect estimation, offering insights into the method's effectiveness and its dependence on key factors like spectral alignment and eigenvalue decay.

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

*Emmanuel J. Candès,Andrew Ilyas,Tijana Zrnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for cost-effectively generating labeled datasets by combining expert annotations with predictions from pre-trained AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving high-quality labeled datasets is expensive, involving either human expertise or experimental input.

Method: The paper proposes using expert labels supplemented by predictions from pre-trained models to create approximate labels with minimal overall error.

Result: The methodology is shown to work effectively in text annotation, image labeling, and protein folding tasks.

Conclusion: The approach enables cost-efficient and rigorous dataset curation by leveraging modern AI capabilities.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either
extensive human annotation or expensive experiments. We propose a method that
supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to
construct labeled datasets more cost-effectively. Our approach results in
probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall
labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset
curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology
through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with
pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

### [354] [What Exactly Does Guidance Do in Masked Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10971)
*He Ye,Rojas Kevin,Tao Molei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper examines how classifier-free guidance (CFG) influences masked discrete diffusion models, studying its effects on sampling behavior, dynamics, and output distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the role of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in discrete diffusion models, particularly its effects on sampling behavior and the structure of the resulting distribution.

Method: The authors derive an explicit mathematical solution to guided reverse dynamics under ideal assumptions and analyze how guidance strength affects sampling behavior and covariance structures across different dimensions (1D and 2D).

Result: Guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppressing overlapping regions, creating distinct covariance structures. For large guidance strengths, TV decay along reverse dynamics follows a double-exponential rate.

Conclusion: Guidance not only shapes the output distribution but also controls the sampling dynamics, which is theoretically supported and experimentally validated.

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DANCE^2 is an interactive performance where audiences collectively influence a robot-dancer duet by voting on robot behavior during key moments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interplay between collective agency and perceived individual influence in shaping a dynamic interaction.

Method: Audience members vote in real-time during a dance performance, influencing the behavior of a wearable robot on the dancer.

Result: Participants reported feeling agency, but voting patterns revealed consistent decisions across performances, highlighting a gap between perceived and actual influence.

Conclusion: The performance serves as an analogy for digital systems where users feel agency but have limited actual influence over outcomes.

Abstract: We describe DANCE^2, an interactive dance performance in which audience
members channel their collective agency into a dancer-robot duet by voting on
the behavior of a wearable robot affixed to the dancer's body. At key moments
during the performance, the audience is invited to either continue the
choreography or override it, shaping the unfolding interaction through
real-time collective input. While post-performance surveys revealed that
participants felt their choices meaningfully influenced the performance, voting
data across four public performances exhibited strikingly consistent patterns.
This tension between what audience members do, what they feel, and what
actually changes highlights a complex interplay between agentive behavior, the
experience of agency, and power. We reflect on how choreography, interaction
design, and the structure of the performance mediate this relationship,
offering a live analogy for algorithmically curated digital systems where
agency is felt, but not exercised.

*Andrea Gaggioli,Sabrina Bartolotta,Andrea Ubaldi,Katusha Gerardini,Eleonora Diletta Sarcinella,Alice Chirico*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines AI's impact on creativity through three modes: Support, Synergy, and Symbiosis, along dimensions of autonomy and agency, and their influence on creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how AI can enhance human creativity by conceptualizing different modes of interaction between AI and humans.

Method: The authors propose a framework identifying modes of interaction (Support, Synergy, Symbiosis) based on AI's autonomy and perceived agency, and analyze implications for various levels of creativity.

Result: The study categorizes AI's contributions to creativity into three distinct modes and explores their influence on creativity levels and the associated theoretical, ethical, and design considerations.

Conclusion: AI can enhance creativity in different ways depending on its autonomy and agency, but careful consideration of the implications is necessary for effective integration.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper reviews the use of Generative AI (GAI) technologies in promoting social interaction, identifying trends and raising ethical concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by increasing threats to mental health and well-being due to reduced social connectedness, necessitating innovative solutions like GAI.

Method: The authors conducted a scoping review of 30 studies since 2020, examining applications, design approaches, and evaluation methods in GAI-based technologies.

Result: The paper identifies application domains such as storytelling, socio-emotional training, and collaborative learning, highlighting participatory design and socio-ethical challenges like cultural bias.

Conclusion: GAI holds potential for enhancing social interaction, but equitable design and inclusive evaluation practices are imperative for its efficacy.

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

*Jun Bai,Rajib Rana,Di Wu,Youyang Qu,Xiaohui Tao,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: FedMLAC is a federated learning framework designed for audio classification that overcomes data/model heterogeneity and data poisoning challenges by using a dual-model architecture and robust aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address significant challenges in Federated Audio Classification, including data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity, and data poisoning, which prior works have failed to tackle in a unified way.

Method: FedMLAC employs dual-model architecture with a lightweight global Plug-in model and a personalized local model, using bidirectional knowledge distillation for improved generalization and personalization. Layer-wise Pruning Aggregation (LPA) filters unreliable updates to enhance robustness.

Result: FedMLAC shows superior performance in both classification accuracy and resilience against noisy data on diverse audio classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: FedMLAC provides a unified and robust framework for Federated Audio Classification by addressing core challenges simultaneously, thus advancing the state-of-the-art in this domain.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving paradigm for training
audio classification (AC) models across distributed clients without sharing raw
data. However, Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) faces three critical
challenges that substantially hinder performance: data heterogeneity, model
heterogeneity, and data poisoning. While prior works have attempted to address
these issues, they are typically treated independently, lacking a unified and
robust solution suited to real-world federated audio scenarios. To bridge this
gap, we propose FedMLAC, a unified mutual learning framework designed to
simultaneously tackle these challenges in FedAC. Specifically, FedMLAC
introduces a dual-model architecture on each client, comprising a personalized
local AC model and a lightweight, globally shared Plug-in model. Through
bidirectional knowledge distillation, the Plug-in model enables global
knowledge transfer while adapting to client-specific data distributions, thus
supporting both generalization and personalization. To further enhance
robustness against corrupted audio data, we develop a Layer-wise Pruning
Aggregation (LPA) strategy that filters unreliable Plug-in model updates based
on parameter deviations during server-side aggregation. Extensive experiments
on four diverse audio classification benchmarks, spanning both speech and
non-speech tasks, demonstrate that FedMLAC consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to
noisy data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for controlling music generation by modifying an autoregressive music transformer called MusicGen using targeted interventions during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enable fine-grained control over music generation, where the generated audio can be manipulated for properties like timbre, style, and genre fusion.

Method: The method involves steering residual stream weights and attention layer activations during inference using linear probes trained on them, modeled as a regression task for improved performance.

Result: The authors demonstrate enhanced control over local and global aspects of generated music, with enhanced performance due to the regression modeling approach.

Conclusion: The method provides a novel approach for achieving both local and global control in music generation, leading to flexibility and high-quality results as evidenced by their demo page.

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of unified comparisons for discrete audio tokenizer methods across benchmarks and streamline their evaluation.

Method: The authors develop a taxonomy of tokenization techniques and assess tokenizers through benchmarks focused on reconstruction quality, downstream tasks, and acoustic language modeling.

Result: The evaluation identifies major strengths, limitations, trade-offs, and unresolved issues in current discrete audio tokenization approaches.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical insights and a resource for guiding future research in discrete audio tokenization methods.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

TL;DR: This paper explores how architectural design choices influence the transfer of audio encoder representations to Large Language Models (LLMs) for improved audio-text capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the under-explored mechanisms governing efficient semantic transfer between audio encoders and LLMs, enabling better integration of audio perception into LLMs.

Method: The authors propose modifications to a standard audio-LLM architecture, guided by mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles, and evaluate the changes via controlled experiments.

Result: The proposed modifications, such as delaying audio integration until textual context is established, optimizing attention submodules, and integrating diverse audio encoders, achieve 10% to 60% improvements over the baseline.

Conclusion: The study validates that specific architectural choices significantly enhance the ability of LLMs to interpret and utilize audio encoder representations, furthering cross-modal learning in audio-LLMs.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

*Chi Zuo,Martin B. Møller,Pablo Martínez-Nuevo,Huayang Huang,Yu Wu,Ye Zhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework named "BNMusic" to blend environmental noise into personalized music generated from user-provided text prompts, improving acoustic experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental noises are often annoying, and conventional acoustic masking techniques require excessive volume increases when misalignment occurs between the masking sound and noise. The paper aims to provide a better solution by blending noise into music personalized based on user input.

Method: The proposed BNMusic framework operates in two stages: (1) generating music using mel-spectrogram representations encapsulating the musical essence of noise, and (2) adaptively amplifying the generated music to optimize blending while preserving auditory quality.

Result: Experimental results on datasets such as MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate that the framework can rhythmically align environmental noise with enhanced music segments, successfully reducing noise noticeability.

Conclusion: BNMusic effectively blends environmental noise into enjoyable, personalized music, improving acoustic experiences and demonstrating the potential for cross-modal applications in audio engineering.

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the Gittins index, highlighting its use in theoretical and practical decision-making, giving examples of its application in optimization and queue management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the perception of the Gittins index as a purely theoretical concept and demonstrate its practical utility in solving decision-making problems.

Method: The authors provide an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index and showcase its application through practical examples, both optimal and suboptimal, with a focus on Bayesian optimization and tail latency minimization.

Result: The paper highlights the versatility of the Gittins index in solving both theoretical and practical problems effectively, with excellent performance even in suboptimal cases.

Conclusion: The Gittins index is a valuable tool not only in theory but also in practical applications, proving its usefulness in a wide range of decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel neo-fascist coding scheme for digital discourse in the USA, uses crowdsourced annotated data to train NLP models, and emphasizes societal responsibility in combating neo-fascism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid growth of neo-fascism poses a threat to democracy and minorities in the USA, necessitating research and actions to prevent escalation.

Method: Developed a coding scheme for analyzing neo-fascist discourse, collected large-scale online forum data, annotated it via crowdsourcing, and applied NLP models to classify neo-fascist rhetoric.

Result: Successfully created classification models for detecting neo-fascist discourse using Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), validated with a labeled dataset.

Conclusion: Neo-fascist rhetoric is pervasive in certain online forums; combating it is vital for maintaining democratic values. Future NLP research must consider societal context for effective detection.

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

### [366] [LLM-Driven Personalized Answer Generation and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10829)
*Mohammadreza Molavi,Mohammadreza Tavakoli,Mohammad Moein,Abdolali Faraji,Gábor Kismihók*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized answer generation in online learning, using StackExchange data from language learning and programming domains. Results show that providing examples helps tailor responses effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how personalized answers can improve learner engagement and reduce educators' workload.

Method: The study utilized a framework and dataset for testing LLMs in generating answers under 0-shot, 1-shot, and few-shot scenarios, validated using BERTScore, LLM evaluation, and human reviews.

Result: Providing LLMs with examples improves their ability to generate customized answers for learners.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in enhancing personalized learning, especially when aided by example-guided answer generation strategies.

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

*Daizhan Cheng*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a domain-based convolutional product (CP) combined with semi-tensor product (STP) to develop a novel CP without padding, which is used to create an STP-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for image and signal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of padding in conventional CNNs by introducing a new convolutional approach using a combination of STP and CP.

Method: The authors integrate domain-based CP with the STP of vectors to design a padding-free CP. They then use this CP to construct an STP-based CNN.

Result: The new STP-based CNN was successfully applied to tasks like image processing and third-order signal identification without the need for padding.

Conclusion: The proposed CP and STP-based CNN offer an efficient and padding-free alternative for convolutional operations, showcasing their potential in image and signal-related applications.

Abstract: The semi-tensor product (STP) of vectors is a generalization of conventional
inner product of vectors, which allows the factor vectors to of different
dimensions. This paper proposes a domain-based convolutional product (CP).
Combining domain-based CP with STP of vectors, a new CP is proposed. Since
there is no zero or any other padding, it can avoid the junk information caused
by padding. Using it, the STP-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is
developed. Its application to image and third order signal identifications is
considered.

### [368] [Energy Aware Camera Location Search Algorithm for Increasing Precision of Observation in Automated Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10251)
*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm to optimize the camera's location in eye-to-hand configurations for improved observation accuracy in automated manufacturing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the significant impact of camera location on the quality of estimations due to noise variations caused by environmental conditions.

Method: The proposed algorithm explores the camera's workspace for optimal positioning by minimizing image noise levels and efficiently adapting a search policy while managing limited energy resources.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to improve observation precision in eye-to-hand configurations, enhancing image processing accuracy without losing high-frequency data.

Conclusion: The algorithm achieves desirable observation precision in automated manufacturing, optimizing camera positioning with limited energy and proving effective in simulated scenarios.

Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many
automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a
full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or
eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing
environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control
and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have
discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.
In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the
camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches
for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this
algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is
unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy
available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the
algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the
search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging
technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation
accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering
out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated
manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success
of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.

*Toby Walsh*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The study evaluates strategy-proof mechanisms for facility location that aim to maximize equitability using the Gini index but faces a fundamental impossibility. Alternate measures and Nash welfare approximation are explored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of designing equitable and strategy-proof facility location mechanisms.

Method: The paper analyzes deterministic and randomized mechanisms using the complemented Gini index and explores Nash welfare approximations.

Result: No strategy-proof mechanism ensures an optimal Gini index. However, complemented Gini index and Nash welfare approximations are investigated.

Conclusion: Current mechanisms face limitations in equitability but alternative measures like complemented Gini index and Nash welfare provide avenues for equitable approximations.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

### [370] [Synchronization for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10258)
*Satvik Maurya,Swamit Tannu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper creates and evaluates three synchronization policies (Passive, Active, and Hybrid) for logical qubits in surface code quantum error correction to mitigate desynchronization and reduce logical error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for logical qubit synchronization during surface code error correction suffer from increased uncorrectable errors due to idle or slowed cycles. A solution is needed to balance synchronization and maintain error correction efficiency.

Method: Three synchronization policies are tested: Passive (baseline, qubits idle until synchronized), Active (gradual slowing with short idle periods), and Hybrid (minimizing slack and adding extra rounds of error correction).

Result: Active policy reduces logical error rate by 2.4x; Hybrid policy reduces logical error rate by 3.4x and enhances decoding latency speedup by up to 2.2x using circuit-level noise models.

Conclusion: The proposed synchronization policies improve logical error rates and decoding latency, enabling higher reliability and efficiency in surface code-based quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes store information reliably in logical
qubits by encoding them in a larger number of less reliable qubits. The surface
code, known for its high resilience to physical errors, is a leading candidate
for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Logical qubits encoded with the
surface code can be in different phases of their syndrome generation cycle,
thereby introducing desynchronization in the system. This can occur due to the
production of non-Clifford states, dropouts due to fabrication defects, and the
use of other QEC codes with the surface code to reduce resource requirements.
Logical operations require the syndrome generation cycles of the logical qubits
involved to be synchronized. This requires the leading qubit to pause or slow
down its cycle, allowing more errors to accumulate before the next cycle,
thereby increasing the risk of uncorrectable errors.
  To synchronize the syndrome generation cycles of logical qubits, we define
three policies - Passive, Active, and Hybrid. The Passive policy is the
baseline, and the simplest, wherein the leading logical qubits idle until they
are synchronized with the remaining logical qubits. On the other hand, the
Active policy aims to slow the leading logical qubits down gradually, by
inserting short idle periods before multiple code cycles. This approach reduces
the logical error rate (LER) by up to 2.4x compared to the Passive policy. The
Hybrid policy further reduces the LER by up to 3.4x by reducing the
synchronization slack and running a few additional rounds of error correction.
Furthermore, the reduction in the logical error rate with the proposed
synchronization policies enables a speedup in decoding latency of up to 2.2x
with a circuit-level noise model.

Result: Theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrate exponential improvements in representational capacity, stability against realistic IBM quantum noise, and robust performance in tasks like charge state classification and genomic predictions.

Conclusion: VQC-MLPNet presents a scalable, noise-resilient framework that expands quantum-enhanced learning, offering theoretical and practical benefits in the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum computing.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional

TL;DR: This paper develops and generalizes the concept of Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence for infinite-dimensional Gaussian measures, providing a regularized version for broader applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the concept of Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence, traditionally applied in finite-dimensional cases, to the more general and complex case of Gaussian measures on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Method: The authors derive a closed-form expression for the divergence for equivalent Gaussian measures and introduce Log-Determinant divergences for positive definite trace-class operators to define a regularized version that works universally.

Result: The proposed Regularized Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence is valid for any pair of Gaussian measures and converges to the exact divergence in the equivalent case as the regularization parameter approaches zero.

Conclusion: The work successfully extends a key divergence concept to infinite-dimensional Gaussian measures while maintaining its interpretability and practicality through regularization.

Abstract: This work studies the Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence, based on the
notion of geometric mean of probability measures, in the setting of Gaussian
measures on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. On the set of all Gaussian
measures equivalent to a fixed one, we present a closed form expression for
this divergence that directly generalizes the finite-dimensional version. Using
the notion of Log-Determinant divergences between positive definite unitized
trace class operators, we then define a Regularized Geometric Jensen-Shannon
divergence that is valid for any pair of Gaussian measures and that recovers
the exact Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence between two equivalent Gaussian
measures when the regularization parameter tends to zero.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in feature selection under double imbalance scenarios where class imbalance and dimensional asymmetry affect traditional RF methods.

Method: Utilize minimal depth thresholding to exploit tree topology for assessing variable relevance in Random Forests.

Result: The proposed approach yields more parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables in simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Minimal depth-based thresholding improves interpretability and effectiveness in RF feature selection under challenging imbalanced conditions.

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

TL;DR: This paper explores optimizing neuromorphic networks with memristive components for modeling dynamical systems using reservoir computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how neuromorphic networks can autonomously predict chaotic time-series and model dynamical systems effectively.

Method: Simulated a memristive neuromorphic network to perform reservoir computing and manipulated input electrodes/voltages to identify optimal dynamical responses.

Result: Optimal responses achieved by maximizing memristor dynamics across their full range and suppressing less effective nonlinear behaviors.

Conclusion: Memristive neuromorphic networks can be effectively optimized for learning dynamical systems using external control parameters.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the phase diagram and memory retrieval abilities of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), introducing modifications to hidden unit designs for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to understand how architectural choices and activation functions in RBMs influence their associative memory capabilities, particularly under standard configurations which are limited by reduced critical capacity.

Method: Tools from statistical physics and finite-size Monte Carlo simulations are employed to study how prior hidden unit distributions (binary, multi-state, ReLU-like) drive thermodynamic properties, proposing adjustments like biases and richer priors.

Result: Standard RBMs suffer from reduced critical capacity, but modifications such as local biases and rich hidden unit priors restore ordered retrieval phases and enhance recall performance.

Conclusion: Improving the design of hidden units significantly boosts the expressive power and associative memory capacity of RBMs, making them more effective even at finite temperatures.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

TL;DR: This paper proposes three methods to identify critical residues in proteins using Random Geometric Graphs (RGG) based on correlation metrics (Cramer's V). The results are compared to experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify critical residues in proteins, which are crucial for their functional roles, by leveraging advanced computational methods.

Method: Three methods were developed to determine critical residues: (1) Using nodal degree in an RGG built using Cramer's V correlation metric with organic thresholding, (2) Ranking the posterior probability changes caused by omitting residues in the RGG, and (3) Analyzing dynamic variations in nodal degrees during protein evolution in molecular simulations.

Result: The three methods demonstrated promising capabilities in identifying critical residues, with comparisons to experimentally-validated data showing alignment and insights.

Conclusion: The study offers innovative computational techniques for identifying critical residues, which provide meaningful comparisons against experimental evidence and may broaden understanding of protein functionality.

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized benchmarks in enzyme function prediction from sequences and to create tools for evaluation of out-of-distribution generalization in this domain.

Method: Developed CARE with two tasks: (1) classification of enzyme commission (EC) numbers from protein sequences and (2) retrieval of EC numbers given chemical reactions. Proposed a new baseline method, CREEP, for the retrieval task.

Result: CARE enables evaluation of enzyme classification and retrieval methods under various generalization splits. Baselines for classification were provided, and initial benchmarks for retrieval using CREEP and CLIPZyme were tested.

Conclusion: CARE provides a systematic way to evaluate enzyme function prediction and retrieval methods, promoting advancement in the field and supporting a wide range of practical applications.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance rehabilitation techniques using AO therapy by investigating the potential role of humanoid robots in therapy sessions.

Method: EEG was used to measure brain activity (ERSPs) of three participants observing human and robot-performed actions, focusing on sensorimotor regions.

Result: Analysis indicated distinct ERSP patterns, including mu and beta rhythm suppression, with one participant demonstrating stronger responses to robot actions. Positive correlations were observed in neural responses across conditions.

Conclusion: EEG is a viable tool for studying neural responses in robot- and human-driven AO therapy, supporting the integration of robotics in rehabilitation.

Abstract: Action observation (AO) therapy is a promising rehabilitative treatment for
motor and language function in individuals recovering from neurological
conditions, such as stroke. This pilot study aimed to investigate the potential
of humanoid robots to support AO therapy in rehabilitation settings. The brain
activity of three healthy right-handed participants was monitored with
electroencephalography (EEG) while they observed eight different actions
performed by two agents, a human actor and a robot, using their left and right
arms. Their event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs, changes in the
spectral power of neural oscillations in response to an event or stimulus,
compared to baseline) in sensorimotor regions were analyzed. The single-subject
analysis showed variability in ERSP patterns among all participants, including
power suppression in sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. One participant showed
stronger responses to "robot" AO conditions than to "human" conditions. Strong
and positive correlations in ERSP across all conditions were observed for
almost all participants and channels, implying common cognitive processes or
neural networks at play in the mirror neuron system during AO. The results
support the feasibility of using EEG to explore differences in neural responses
to observation of robot- and human-induced actions.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The study presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) replanning in head-and-neck cancer patients, aiming for better tumor coverage and reduced organ-at-risk exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual replanning processes for IMPT in head-and-neck cancer patients are time-consuming and resource-intensive, necessitating a more efficient solution to address anatomical changes affecting treatment quality.

Method: The paper introduces a patient-specific DRL framework that trains personalized agents using anatomical data and augmented scenarios to automate IMPT replanning. Two DRL algorithms (Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization) are utilized with dose-volume histograms as input states and priority adjustments as actions.

Result: The DRL agents significantly improved treatment plan scores for five HNC patients from an initial average of 120.63 to scores of 139.78 (DQN) and 142.74 (PPO), outperforming manual replans by human planners.

Conclusion: Deep reinforcement learning offers promising potential for adaptive proton therapy, improving efficiency and treatment quality while addressing complexities in geometric and dosimetric adaptation.

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering

*Nicholas Summerfield,Qisheng He,Alex Kuo,Ahmed I. Ghanem,Simeng Zhu,Chase Ruff,Joshua Pan,Anudeep Kumar,Prashant Nagpal,Jiwei Zhao,Ming Dong,Carri K. Glide-Hurst*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This study introduces MAGIC, a deep learning-based model for cardiac substructure segmentation across various imaging modalities, offering efficient, accurate, and modality-agnostic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of generalizability of current deep learning models for cardiac substructure segmentation, particularly across different imaging modalities and overlapping structures.

Method: MAGIC employs a modality-agnostic framework based on nnU-Net, with replicated encoding and decoding branches for a U-shaped backbone, and is trained on manually annotated cardiac images from different modalities to create a single, integrative segmentation model.

Result: The MAGIC framework achieved average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 0.75 for Sim-CT, 0.68 for MR-Linac, and 0.80 for CCTA, outperforming comparison models in 57% of cases with limited statistical significance in differences.

Conclusion: MAGIC effectively segments cardiac substructures across multiple modalities, offering a lightweight, flexible, and clinically implementable solution that simplifies computational demands and reduces contouring burden.

Abstract: Cardiac substructures are essential in thoracic radiation therapy planning to
minimize risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Deep learning (DL) offers
efficient methods to reduce contouring burden but lacks generalizability across
different modalities and overlapping structures. This work introduces and
validates a Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for comprehensive and
multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation. MAGIC is implemented through
replicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net-based, U-shaped
backbone conserving the function of a single model. Twenty cardiac
substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries
(CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac,
and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used
to train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison
models (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently
trained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against
reference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p<0.05). Average DSC scores were
0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC
outperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical
differences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that
is lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping
structures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by
simplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled
flexibility for clinical settings.

### [382] [FastFLUX: Pruning FLUX with Block-wise Replacement and Sandwich Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10035)
*Fuhan Cai,Yong Guo,Jie Li,Wenbo Li,Xiangzhong Fang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces FastFLUX, a framework to accelerate FLUX inference in text-to-image generation by pruning complex modules while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image generation models like FLUX are limited by slow inference, high memory consumption, and poor deployment due to their large parameter sizes.

Method: FastFLUX employs a Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method to prune heavy model components and Sandwich Training (ST) to locally fine-tune the model and ensure performance stability.

Result: FastFLUX achieves significant speed-up during inference and maintains high image quality with only minor performance trade-offs even after pruning 20% of the model.

Conclusion: FastFLUX offers an effective solution to improve the efficiency and deployability of FLUX models via a structured pruning approach without compromising image generation quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

### [383] [Ambient Diffusion Omni: Training Good Models with Bad Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10038)
*Giannis Daras,Adrian Rodriguez-Munoz,Adam Klivans,Antonio Torralba,Constantinos Daskalakis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ambient Diffusion Omni, a framework for improving diffusion models by utilizing low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images instead of relying solely on curated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curated datasets can exclude valuable low-quality images, which may still carry useful training signals for diffusion models.

Method: The framework exploits spectral power law decay and locality properties of images, using corrupted images like Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur during training.

Result: State-of-the-art ImageNet FID scores were achieved, along with improvements in image quality and diversity for text-to-image generative modeling.

Conclusion: Noise dampens the skew between high-quality and mixed-quality distributions, enabling diffusion models to learn effectively from disparate data sources.

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

### [384] [Learning-based density-equalizing map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10027)
*Yanwen Huang,Lok Ming Lui,Gary P. T. Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a learning-based density-equalizing mapping (LDEM) framework using deep neural networks, addressing issues faced by traditional methods and providing superior results for density distributions in both 2D and 3D domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for density-equalizing maps face challenges like limited accuracy, overlapping artifacts, and difficulties in transitioning from 2D to 3D due to derivative-dependent energy formulations.

Method: The method employs deep neural networks with a novel loss function ensuring density uniformity and geometric regularity, utilizing a hierarchical approach for coarse and dense-level transformation predictions.

Result: The proposed LDEM method achieves better density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior methods for various density distributions, while being applicable to both 2D and 3D without structural changes.

Conclusion: The framework expands possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps, making them widely applicable in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper presents a virtual try-on method using real human bodies, doing away with robotic mannequins, and achieves accurate garment alignment through a hybrid person representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited to front views, lack real-time functionality, and involve expensive robotic mannequins that poorly replicate body deformations while failing to align garments with human bodies.

Method: A new virtual try-on approach using low-barrier dataset collection with real humans and introducing a hybrid representation that combines existing techniques with a DensePose map for better alignment and human-garment interaction.

Result: The method surpassed state-of-the-art techniques in image quality and temporal consistency, and users found it generally helpful for garment purchase decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed system improves virtual try-on accuracy and usability without expensive robotic setups, making it practical and consumer-friendly.

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Edit360 is a framework that extends 2D edits to consistent 3D assets using video diffusion models, overcoming limitations in view-specific editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable fine-grained, multi-view consistent edits for 3D assets, overcoming restrictions of existing viewpoint-limited methods.

Method: Using video diffusion models and an Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism to extend 2D edits into 360-degree, coherent 3D reconstructions.

Result: Edit360 generates multi-view consistent edited sequences for high-quality 3D reconstructions with customized user-specific designs.

Conclusion: Edit360 provides a flexible and practical solution for customizable 3D asset creation through a novel diffusion-based editing framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

*Chengxu Zuo,Jiawei Huang,Xiao Jiang,Yuan Yao,Xiangren Shi,Rui Cao,Xinyu Yi,Feng Xu,Shihui Guo,Yipeng Qin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic calibration method for sparse inertial motion capture systems, enabling real-time calibration without an explicit process and expanding IMU usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inertial motion capture systems assume static calibration parameters, limiting their application in dynamic environments.

Method: The method employs relaxed assumptions for dynamic calibration, synthetic datasets for model training, and a Transformer-based neural network for parameter estimation in real time.

Result: The method allows real-time calibration and accurate motion capture with sparse IMUs, achieving implicit calibration for the first time.

Conclusion: This novel approach enables long-term usability and seamless integration of IMUs, enhancing their practical application scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

*Yuliang Zhu,Jing Cheng,Qi Xie,Zhuo-Xu Cui,Qingyong Zhu,Yuanyuan Liu,Xin Liu,Jianfeng Ren,Chengbo Wang,Dong Liang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel network architecture, DUN-SRE, to improve Dynamic MRI reconstruction by incorporating both spatial and temporal rotation symmetries through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic MRI reconstruction often suffers under aggressive undersampling, and existing models fail to fully utilize temporal symmetries. This paper seeks to address this by integrating spatiotemporal rotation equivariance into the reconstruction process.

Method: The authors propose DUN-SRE, a Deep Unrolling Network that uses spatiotemporal rotation equivariance with a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture, incorporating symmetry constraints and a high-fidelity group filter parameterization.

Result: The DUN-SRE model demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets, particularly excelling at preserving rotation-symmetric structures and showcasing strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: DUN-SRE effectively improves image quality for dynamic MRI by rigorously enforcing spatiotemporal symmetry, demonstrating its potential across dynamic MRI tasks while ensuring physical accuracy and structural integrity.

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

*Minye Shao,Zeyu Wang,Haoran Duan,Yawen Huang,Bing Zhai,Shizheng Wang,Yang Long,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HFF-Net, a model leveraging frequency-domain analysis for improved segmentation of MRI-enhanced brain tumor regions, yielding substantial performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods underperform in segmenting MRI contrast-enhanced tumor regions due to the complexity of tumor textures and directional variations.

Method: The proposed HFF-Net includes three key modules: Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD), Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC), and Frequency Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) for extracting, enhancing, and fusing critical tumor features from MRI data.

Result: Experiments on public datasets revealed that HFF-Net achieves relative increases of 4.48% in mean Dice scores and 7.33% improvement in segmenting contrast-enhancing tumor regions.

Conclusion: The research provides evidence that frequency-domain analysis is an effective approach for MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, with HFF-Net showing promising clinical and computational advantages.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors, particularly contrast-enhancing regions
visible in post-contrast MRI (areas highlighted by contrast agent injection),
is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains
challenging. However, current methods exhibit notable performance degradation
in segmenting these enhancing brain tumor areas, largely due to insufficient
consideration of MRI-specific tumor features such as complex textures and
directional variations. To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency
Fusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a
frequency-domain perspective. To comprehensively characterize tumor regions, we
develop a Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) module that separates MRI images
into low-frequency components, capturing smooth tumor contours and
high-frequency components, highlighting detailed textures and directional
edges. To further enhance sensitivity to tumor boundaries, we introduce an
Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC) module that adaptively emphasizes critical
high-frequency details using dynamically updated convolution kernels. To
effectively fuse tumor features across multiple scales, we design a Frequency
Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) integrating semantic, positional, and
slice-specific information. We further validate and interpret frequency-domain
improvements through visualization, theoretical reasoning, and experimental
analyses. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that
HFF-Net achieves an average relative improvement of 4.48\% (ranging from 2.39\%
to 7.72\%) in the mean Dice scores across the three major subregions, and an
average relative improvement of 7.33% (ranging from 5.96% to 8.64%) in the
segmentation of contrast-enhancing tumor regions, while maintaining favorable
computational efficiency and clinical applicability. Code:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCELLA, a novel framework to improve medical imaging latent diffusion models (LDMs) under data-limited conditions, achieving better performance and accessibility for medical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging faces challenges due to data scarcity, and existing methods to train latent diffusion models (LDMs) rely on strategies that limit performance and accessibility.

Method: The paper proposes CCELLA, a dual-head conditioning approach that utilizes large language model text features and pathology classification, alongside a joint loss function and data-efficient LDM training framework.

Result: CCELLA significantly outperforms prior models, achieving a 3D FID score of 0.025 on prostate MRI datasets compared to 0.071. Synthetic images enhance classifier performance from 69% to 74% for prostate cancer prediction.

Conclusion: CCELLA demonstrates effective pathology-conditioned LDM training with limited data, enabling high-quality image synthesis and improving downstream medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges
affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical
LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific
accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text
encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with
large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language
model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel
dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net
with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through
cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep
embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM
training framework. In combination, these strategies enable
pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis
given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance
and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a
size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent
foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer
prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training
dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier
solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to
training on real images alone.

*Ana Lawry Aguila,Peirong Liu,Oula Puonti,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel conditional diffusion model for unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI, emphasizing healthy image reconstruction and surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pathology detection methods in brain MRI require diseased subject data, challenging their application to rare diseases. Current unsupervised approaches often fail to adequately reconstruct abnormalities while preserving healthy areas.

Method: The authors introduce a conditional diffusion model guided by synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images through fluid-driven anomaly randomization, ensuring realistic and anatomically coherent synthetic anomalies.

Result: The model consistently outperforms variational autoencoders, latent diffusion methods (conditional/unconditional), and supervised inpainting approaches on pathology detection tasks.

Conclusion: The novel framework effectively enhances pathology detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI, proving its utility as a promising alternative to supervised methodologies.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning has enabled accurate pathology detection in brain
MRI, but requires training data from diseased subjects that may not be readily
available in some scenarios, for example, in the case of rare diseases.
Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection, in particular using
diffusion models, has gained popularity in the medical field as it allows for
training on healthy images alone, eliminating the need for large
disease-specific cohorts. These methods assume that a model trained on normal
data cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this
assumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or
accurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In
this work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for
anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly
supervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images
into the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.
To generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly
randomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary
dataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and
anatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,
using both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS
dataset. In our extensive experiments, our model: (i) consistently outperforms
variational autoencoders, and conditional and unconditional latent diffusion;
and (ii) surpasses on most datasets, the performance of supervised inpainting
methods with access to paired diseased/healthy images.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWDL-Net, a novel semi-supervised learning framework for segmenting intracranial hemorrhage in medical images, which significantly outperforms current methods even with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of segmenting intracranial hemorrhages in medical imaging, which requires large annotated datasets that are often costly and time-consuming to create.

Method: SWDL-Net leverages a combination of Laplacian pyramid for edge sharpening and deep convolutional upsampling for precision, alongside a difference learning mechanism for integrating these techniques.

Result: SWDL-Net demonstrated superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on both a 271-case ICH dataset with 2% labeled data and the Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data.

Conclusion: SWDL-Net offers a powerful semi-supervised approach that reduces dependency on labeled data while improving segmentation of lesion details and boundaries, validated by extensive experiments and released implementations.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been
released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.

*Xi Chen,Zhiqiang Shen,Peng Cao,Jinzhu Yang,Osmar R. Zaiane*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConStyX, a new method that enhances Domain Generalization (DG) for medical image segmentation by addressing limitations in domain randomization with an innovative approach to data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts impair the performance of medical image segmentation, and existing DG methods based on domain randomization struggle with efficiency and over-augmentation issues.

Method: ConStyX augments both content and style of training images, covering broader domain variations, and manages negative effects of over-augmented features during training.

Result: Experiments show that ConStyX significantly improves the generalization performance across multiple medical imaging domains.

Conclusion: ConStyX is a promising DG solution that overcomes domain randomization limitations and enhances the performance in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical images are usually collected from multiple domains, leading to domain
shifts that impair the performance of medical image segmentation models. Domain
Generalization (DG) aims to address this issue by training a robust model with
strong generalizability. Recently, numerous domain randomization-based DG
methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from the following
limitations: 1) constrained efficiency of domain randomization due to their
exclusive dependence on image style perturbation, and 2) neglect of the adverse
effects of over-augmented images on model training. To address these issues, we
propose a novel domain randomization-based DG method, called content style
augmentation (ConStyX), for generalizable medical image segmentation.
Specifically, ConStyX 1) augments the content and style of training data,
allowing the augmented training data to better cover a wider range of data
domains, and 2) leverages well-augmented features while mitigating the negative
effects of over-augmented features during model training. Extensive experiments
across multiple domains demonstrate that our ConStyX achieves superior
generalization performance. The code is available at
https://github.com/jwxsp1/ConStyX.

### [395] [Med-URWKV: Pure RWKV With ImageNet Pre-training For Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10858)
*Zhenhuan Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-URWKV, a medical image segmentation model based on the RWKV framework with ImageNet pretraining, achieving competitive results compared to models trained from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve medical image segmentation by addressing limitations of existing architectures like CNNs and Transformers while leveraging the RWKV model's lightweight computational complexity and long-range modeling capabilities.

Method: Develop a pure RWKV-based segmentation model called Med-URWKV, utilizing an ImageNet-pretrained VRWKV encoder integrated within the U-Net framework.

Result: Med-URWKV demonstrates comparable or superior performance across seven datasets compared to RWKV models trained from scratch, showcasing the benefits of pretraining.

Conclusion: Using a pretrained VRWKV encoder enhances model performance in medical image segmentation; Med-URWKV sets a precedent in leveraging pretrained RWKV for such tasks.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and key technology in
computer-aided diagnosis and treatment. Previous methods can be broadly
classified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,
Transformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of
them has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or
the computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.
Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a
promising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range
modeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have
also adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive
performance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the
Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring
the potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical
image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure
RWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates
ImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical
image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first
pure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a
large-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets
demonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation
performance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from
scratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder
in enhancing model performance. The codes will be released.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study introduces an AI solution for detecting artifacts in digital pathology slides, traditionally done manually, using deep learning, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in digital pathology can distort AI diagnostic model performances and require manual review, prompting the need for automated quality assurance solutions incorporating deep learning.

Method: The researchers utilized 133 whole-slide images annotated for 10 artifact types, performed ablation studies, and used InceptionResNet-based models for artifact localization via hybrid single/binary and multi-instance approaches.

Result: The AI effectively detected artifacts and suggested a mix of single artifact binary models and multi-instance models, optimizing its application for artifact identification.

Conclusion: A hybrid AI approach to artifact screening can enhance efficiency and scalability in digital pathology quality assurance, addressing current gaps and reducing manual workload.

Abstract: Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology,
where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been
shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current
practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of
these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis.
Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting
artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage
deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and
scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in
digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation.
  We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by
analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types
or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a
map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to
specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and
effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues.
  From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images
were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed
software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple
models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet
was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a
limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together
(chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid
design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as
well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.

*Ali Waqas,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework combining AI-driven Genetic Algorithms and Random Forests for adaptive distributed CNN-based wireless image classification under variable SNR and computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in current split-network DNN methods for IoT devices, which lack adaptability to changing computational and channel conditions.

Method: The framework employs a Learning-Assisted Intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA), supported by Random Forests, to optimize CNN configurations based on computational budgets and SNR constraints.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance, achieving a 10% classification accuracy boost compared to prior adaptive JSCC methods, even at low SNR (-10dB).

Conclusion: This adaptive approach improves computational efficiency and wireless image classification for IoT under varying conditions, enhancing scalability and accuracy.

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

### [398] [Faster CONGEST Approximation Algorithms for Maximum Weighted Independent Set in Sparse Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10845)
*Salwa Faour,Fabian Kuhn*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper investigates deterministic distributed algorithms for the Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem in trees and graphs with bounded arboricity, focusing on delving into their approximation complexities and bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore efficient deterministic methods for the MWIS problem in sparse graph families, specifically trees and graphs of bounded arboricity, as it remains computationally challenging to approximate in general scenarios.

Method: The paper provides tight complexity bounds for trees, implements the local rounding framework for bounded arboricity graphs, and develops two specific algorithms for improved approximation and runtime results.

Result: Key results include a tight \(\Theta(\log^*(n) / \epsilon)\) complexity for \((1-\epsilon)\)-approximation in trees and two algorithms for bounded arboricity graphs offering better weight approximations and runtime performance compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The study achieves novel deterministic algorithms for MWIS that outperform prior results in terms of approximation guarantees and computational complexity, especially for trees and certain sparse graph categories.

Abstract: The maximum independent set problem is a classic optimization problem that
has also been studied quite intensively in the distributed setting. While the
problem is hard to approximate in general, there are good approximation
algorithms known for several sparse graph families. In this paper, we consider
deterministic distributed CONGEST algorithms for the weighted version of the
problem in trees and graphs of bounded arboricity.
  For trees, we prove that the task of deterministically computing a
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximate solution to the maximum weight independent set
(MWIS) problem has a tight $\Theta(\log^*(n) / \epsilon)$ complexity. The lower
bound already holds on unweighted oriented paths. On the upper bound side, we
show that the bound can be achieved even in unrooted trees.
  For graphs $G=(V,E)$ of arboricity $\beta>1$, we give two algorithms. If the
sum of all node weights is $w(V)$, we show that for any $\epsilon>0$, an
independent set of weight at least $(1-\epsilon)\cdot \frac{w(V)}{4\beta}$ can
be computed in $O(\log^2(\beta/\epsilon)/\epsilon + \log^* n)$ rounds. This
result is obtained by a direct application of the local rounding framework of
Faour, Ghaffari, Grunau, Kuhn, and Rozho\v{n} [SODA '23]. We further show that
for any $\epsilon>0$, an independent set of weight at least
$(1-\epsilon)\cdot\frac{w(V)}{2\beta+1}$ can be computed in
$O(\log^3(\beta)\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon^2 \cdot\log n)$ rounds. This
improves on a recent result of Gil [OPODIS '23], who showed that a
$1/\lfloor(2+\epsilon)\beta\rfloor$-approximation to the MWIS problem can be
computed in $O(\beta\cdot\log n)$ rounds. As an intermediate step, we design an
algorithm to compute an independent set of total weight at least
$(1-\epsilon)\cdot\sum_{v\in V}\frac{w(v)}{deg(v)+1}$ in time
$O(\log^3(\Delta)\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon + \log^* n)$, where $\Delta$ is
the maximum degree of the graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately modeling impacts, as there is no universally accepted constitutive law governing impact mechanics.

Method: Comparative discussion and numerical examination of rigid-body and soft contact approaches for modeling impacts in systems with unilateral contacts and elastic elements.

Result: Numerical examples illustrating the behavior and interactions in systems with unilateral springs and multiple collision scenarios.

Conclusion: Examines parameters critically for systems with unilateral springs and highlights the complexity of modeling impacts in dynamic systems.

Abstract: Collisions and impacts are the principal reasons for impulsive motions, which
we frequently see in dynamic responses of systems. Precise modelling of impacts
is a challenging problem due to the lack of the accurate and commonly accepted
constitutive law that governs their mechanics. Rigid-body approach and soft
contact methods are discussed in this paper and examined in the presented
numerical examples. The main focus is set to impacts in systems with multiple
unilateral contacts and collisions with elastic elements of the reference.
Parameters of interconnecting unilateral springs are under discussion.

*Gwenevere Frank,Seyed Yahya Shirazi,Jason Palmer,Gert Cauwenberghs,Scott Makeig,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper examines the influence of data quantity versus the number of channels on ICA decomposition quality, revealing trends suggesting that more EEG data improves results without clear saturation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the trade-off between data quantity and the number of channels in EEG ICA decomposition quality, shedding light on optimal data collection practices.

Method: AMICA was applied on a 71-channel EEG dataset from 13 subjects, with varying data quantities corresponding to specific frame-to-channel ratios. Decomposition quality was measured using mutual information reduction (MIR) and the near dipolarity of components.

Result: Results show an asymptotic improvement in MIR and an upward trend in near dipolarity as data quantity increases. No clear plateau was observed, suggesting incremental benefits from increased data collection.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that EEG data quantity has a significant impact on ICA decomposition quality, challenging common heuristics by suggesting that additional data may provide continuous benefits.

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an important step in EEG processing
for a wide-ranging set of applications. However, ICA requires well-designed
studies and data collection practices to yield optimal results. Past studies
have focused on quantitative evaluation of the differences in quality produced
by different ICA algorithms as well as different configurations of parameters
for AMICA, a multimodal ICA algorithm that is considered the benchmark against
which other algorithms are measured. Here, the effect of the data quantity
versus the number of channels on decomposition quality is explored. AMICA
decompositions were run on a 71 channel dataset with 13 subjects while randomly
subsampling data to correspond to specific ratios of the number of frames in a
dataset to the channel count. Decomposition quality was evaluated for the
varying quantities of data using measures of mutual information reduction (MIR)
and the near dipolarity of components. We also note that an asymptotic trend
can be seen in the increase of MIR and a general increasing trend in near
dipolarity with increasing data, but no definitive plateau in these metrics was
observed, suggesting that the benefits of collecting additional EEG data may
extend beyond common heuristic thresholds and continue to enhance decomposition
quality.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The study introduces a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for accurately estimating ground reaction force (GRF) using wearable insole sensors, overcoming challenges like noise and lesser accuracy compared to instrumented treadmills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instrumented treadmills, while considered the gold standard for measuring GRF, are expensive and lack portability, making wearable insole sensors a potential low-cost alternative. However, these insole sensors suffer from noise and reduced accuracy, necessitating improvements.

Method: The study proposes a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework that uses similarity and temporal features within mini-batches during the training process to capture complementary and sequential features from wearable sensor data.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrated that the framework significantly improves GRF estimation from wearable insole sensor data compared to current baseline methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances GRF estimation accuracy for wearable sensors, offering a practical and affordable alternative to instrumented treadmills for various applications like healthcare and rehabilitation.

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

*Zhecheng Liu,Jeff D. Eldredge*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL) method for aerodynamic lift control in gusty conditions, surpassing traditional linear control methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear strategies for flow control prove ineffective in strong or prolonged gust disturbances, necessitating more adaptive and robust solutions.

Method: The authors propose using transformer-based RL to handle partial observability and accelerate learning with pretraining (using linear control as an expert policy) and task transfer learning.

Result: The RL strategy outperforms the best proportional control, especially for sequences with increasing gusts, and generalizes well across different configurations and conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed transformer-RL framework delivers superior and more generalizable aerodynamic lift control, supported by pretraining and task transfer techniques, setting a foundation for tackling complex flow problems.

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

TL;DR: OmniFluids introduces a physics pre-trained operator learning framework for fast and accurate fluid dynamics simulations, achieving significant speedups and outperforming AI-driven methods in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiencies and limitations of traditional computational fluid dynamics methods, aiming to accelerate fluid dynamics simulations using deep learning while overcoming issues of cost, stability, and extensive data requirements.

Method: OmniFluids leverages physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning within a network architecture featuring a mixture of operators, multi-frame decoder, and factorized Fourier layers.

Result: OmniFluids delivers 10-100x speed improvements over classical solvers, enhances accuracy in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics, and successfully recovers physical parameters from sparse and noisy data.

Conclusion: OmniFluids sets a new benchmark for surrogate modeling in complex fluid systems, emphasizing scalability, efficiency, and generalizability under data constraints.

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper encodes the call-by-push-value lambda calculus (CBPV) in the π-calculus and establishes its soundness and completeness, using informal proofs supplemented by a partial Coq formalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a robust encoding of CBPV into π-calculus that aligns well with established criteria for correctness and facilitates bisimulation analysis.

Method: The authors develop an encoding specialized to internal π-calculus to simplify issues related to de Bruijn indices and bisimulation congruence, and evaluate the encoding against Gorla's criteria for good encodings.

Result: The encoding was shown to fulfill soundness, completeness, and congruence properties. It aligns with Gorla's criteria and provides direct comparison with Milner’s encoding techniques.

Conclusion: The encoding is deemed reliable based on informal proofs and partial formalization, despite certain lemmas lacking rigorous formal proofs, which are justified with reasonable informal arguments.

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

TL;DR: StepProof is a new method for step-by-step verification of natural language proofs, improving upon existing autoformalization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to bridge the gap in interactive theorem provers that lack natural language interfaces and achieve more granular verification of natural language proofs.

Method: StepProof breaks down complete natural language proofs into subproofs, enabling granular, sentence-level verification using advancements in large language models.

Result: StepProof significantly boosts proof success rates and efficiency. Minor manual adjustments to natural language inputs further enhance performance.

Conclusion: StepProof advances autoformalization by enabling finer, step-by-step verification, improving upon existing methods for formal proof verification.

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

Motivation: To better understand SSL methods in single-cell data analysis and provide a standardized framework for evaluation.

Method: Evaluated 19 SSL methods using nine datasets and three downstream tasks, along with comparing data augmentation strategies.

Result: Task-specific performance trade-offs were identified among specialized single-cell frameworks and generic SSL methods. Random masking was the best data augmentation technique.

Conclusion: scSSL-Bench aids in applying SSL to single-cell analysis, revealing the necessity for a dedicated multi-modal single-cell integration framework.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Nullsettes, a benchmark for assessing genomic language models (gLMs) for mutation effect prediction, emphasizing the importance of considering sequence likelihood and length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to evaluate and enhance gLMs' ability to predict functional outcomes of genetic sequences, a critical task in synthetic biology for designing functional DNA.

Method: Nullsettes, a predictive benchmark task, was developed to test gLMs on their ability to predict loss-of-function mutations caused by key control element translocations. They evaluated 12 models on prediction performance and sequence likelihood.

Result: Mutation effect prediction performance was shown to strongly correlate with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant. The performance range is influenced by sequence length.

Conclusion: Accurate mutation predictions by gLMs depend on accounting for both sequence likelihood and sequence length, making these factors critical in synthetic biology applications.

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

*Pratik Worah*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper presents an algorithm to identify homogeneous subgroups in large datasets, achieving efficient and accurate classification. It is applied to breast cancer data for meaningful biological insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this study is improving the identification of homogeneous subgroups within complex datasets, a task important for understanding specific patterns and mechanisms, such as disease pathways.

Method: A novel algorithm was designed with a rounding technique similar to Goemans and Williamson (1994), achieving an approximation factor of 0.82. This method was applied to breast cancer RNA microarray data.

Result: The algorithm successfully identified homogeneous subcohorts of patients, highlighting significant changes in methylation levels and nuclear receptor expression within the breast cancer dataset.

Conclusion: The approach provides a valuable tool for systematically identifying patient subgroups, which can facilitate the discovery of specific disease pathways and targeted therapeutics.

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

*Yuke Xie,Hervé Chauris,Nicolas Desassis*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: Introduces a novel framework that integrates pretrained diffusion models into seismic imaging to improve stability and quality while avoiding noisy intermediate states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address instability and challenges in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) caused by conventional diffusion processes working on noisy velocity fields.

Method: Incorporates a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a generative diffusion prior via a score rematching strategy, operating directly in clean image space without reverse diffusion sampling.

Result: Improved fidelity, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to existing methods for seismic imaging and other inverse problem tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is practical, computationally efficient, and enhances stability and inversion quality in physics-constrained imaging tasks like FWI.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

*Oleg Berngardt,Ivan Lavygin*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The study develops an automatic classifier using data from SuperDARN and SECIRA radar networks, leveraging ionospheric modeling and radar measurements, with 14 confidently separable classes identified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to create a reliable model to classify data from decameter radar networks, enhancing the understanding of radar scatter in the ionosphere.

Method: The method combines radar data with ionospheric propagation models and quality metrics. It utilized two years of data from 12 radars across networks, incorporating elevation calibration and ray-tracing techniques.

Result: The optimal classification resulted in 37 classes, with 14 confidently separable classes. Key parameters include ray-tracing trajectory shape, scattering height, and Doppler velocity.

Conclusion: The classifier aligns with physical mechanisms and captures geographic and solar/geomagnetic dependencies effectively, highlighting the critical role of selected radar parameters in classification.

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAW-HF, a lightweight hybrid framework for optimizing raw data queries, reducing workload execution time significantly and improving resource utilization compared to traditional DBMS and existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in querying raw data, such as resource-intensive data loading by traditional DBMS and reparsing by in-situ engines, and to reduce costs caused by over or under-allocation of resources.

Method: The authors propose RAW-HF, a framework that uses lightweight modules to optimize resources required for executing workloads and maximizes utilization of available resources. Comparisons are made with existing approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Result: RAW-HF demonstrated over 90% and 85% reduction in workload execution time for SDSS and LOD datasets, a 26% reduction in CPU and IO resource utilization, while improving memory utilization by 33%, compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: RAW-HF effectively optimizes query execution for raw data, significantly reducing execution time and resource usage while enhancing memory utilization, offering a promising alternative to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Scientific experiments and modern applications are generating large amounts
of data every day. Most organizations utilize In-house servers or Cloud
resources to manage application data and workload. The traditional database
management system (DBMS) and HTAP systems spend significant time & resources to
load the entire dataset into DBMS before starting query execution. On the other
hand, in-situ engines may reparse required data multiple times, increasing
resource utilization and data processing costs. Additionally, over or
under-allocation of resources also increases application running costs. This
paper proposes a lightweight Resource Availability &Workload aware Hybrid
Framework (RAW-HF) to optimize querying raw data by utilizing existing finite
resources efficiently. RAW-HF includes modules that help optimize the resources
required to execute a given workload and maximize the utilization of existing
resources. The impact of applying RAW-HF to real-world scientific dataset
workloads like Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Linked Observation Data
(LOD) presented over 90% and 85% reduction in workload execution time (WET)
compared to widely used traditional DBMS PostgreSQL. The overall CPU, IO
resource utilization, and WET have been reduced by 26%, 25%, and 26%,
respectively, while improving memory utilization by 33%, compared to the
state-of-the-art workload-aware partial loading technique (WA) proposed for
hybrid systems. A comparison of MUAR technique used by RAW-HF with machine
learning based resource allocation techniques like PCC is also presented.

### [412] [Contrastive Matrix Completion with Denoising and Augmented Graph Views for Robust Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10658)
*Narges Nemati,Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning" (MCCL) to improve matrix completion tasks in recommender systems. It enhances generalizability and accuracy by using dual graph representations and mutual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based matrix completion methods in recommender systems struggle with noise, irrelevant edges, and overfitting, limiting performance and generalizability.

Method: MCCL generates two graph representations: one uses GNN layers with an attention mechanism for denoising, while the other employs a graph variational autoencoder to align distributions. A mutual learning loss harmonizes these representations.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show MCCL achieves up to a 0.8% improvement in RMSE and enhances ranking metrics by up to 36%.

Conclusion: MCCL improves both prediction accuracy and ranking performance in matrix completion tasks, addressing the challenges of noise and overfitting in GNN-based methods.

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

TL;DR: The paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of over 50 research papers on keyphrase generation, identifies issues in evaluation practices, and releases a pre-trained model to encourage future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Keyphrase generation is a task with significant research activity, but the current state of the field is uncertain due to the lack of a comprehensive review.

Method: Analyzed over 50 research papers on keyphrase generation, focusing on evaluation practices, benchmark datasets, and metric inconsistencies. Released a PLM-based model to support research efforts.

Result: Found critical issues in evaluation methodologies, benchmark dataset similarities, and metric inconsistencies, which have led to performance overestimations.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the need to improve evaluation frameworks in keyphrase generation and encourages research by providing a robust pre-trained model.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

*Hossein A. Rahmani,Varsha Ramineni,Nick Craswell,Bhaskar Mitra,Emine Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the reliability and biases of synthetic test collections created using Large Language Models (LLMs) for Information Retrieval system evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in creating diverse queries and obtaining costly relevance judgments for IR evaluations while exploring the viability of LLMs in synthetic test collection generation.

Method: Synthetic queries and labels were generated using LLMs, and biases in evaluation results were analyzed empirically and validated via a linear mixed-effects model.

Result: The study identified biases in evaluation results affecting absolute system performance but found that relative system performance comparisons remain less impacted.

Conclusion: While synthetic test collections can introduce biases, their impact on relative system performance comparisons is less significant, supporting their potential use in IR system evaluation under certain conditions.

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LightKG proposes a simplified Graph Neural Network (GNN) layer and efficient contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to address sparsity and performance issues in Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based KGRSs struggle under sparse interactions and their performance is hindered by complex mechanisms and longer training times induced by SSL methods.

Method: LightKG uses a simplified GNN layer with scalar pair encodings for relations, linear aggregation framework, and contrastive SSL that avoids subgraph generation.

Result: LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRS baselines across sparse and dense datasets, improving recommendation accuracy by 5.8% on average and reducing training time by 84.3%.

Conclusion: LightKG effectively addresses sparsity challenges, improving efficiency and accuracy for KGRSs while substantially reducing training times.

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is

TL;DR: SHORE is a framework designed to improve long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction in digital gaming, addressing challenges like delayed payments and high-value outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in predicting long-term user LTV, which is critical for monetization but hindered by sparse user data and unpredictable behaviors.

Method: SHORE uses short-horizon predictions as auxiliary tasks and applies a hybrid loss function combining order-preserving classification with dynamic Huber loss.

Result: SHORE reduces prediction error by 47.91% based on online experiments with real-world datasets, showcasing robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: SHORE represents a significant advancement in industrial-scale LTV prediction for digital gaming, outperforming traditional methods and improving accuracy.

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MGOE, a novel framework leveraging macro graph embeddings for multi-task learning in billion-scale graphs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods neglect the graph structures in billion-scale, multi-task learning, leading to untapped performance potential.

Method: The MGOE framework utilizes macro graph embeddings via Macro Graph Bottom and Macro Prediction Tower to model task-specific correlations and incorporate graph information effectively.

Result: MGOE outperformed state-of-the-art methods in extensive offline experiments on public datasets and online A/B tests in billion-scale systems.

Conclusion: MGOE is a pioneering framework for graph-based multi-task learning, capable of scaling to billion-scale applications with enhanced accuracy and utility.

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

*Kehan Long,Shasha Li,Chen Xu,Jintao Tang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel strategy called GCCP to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of pointwise ranking for document relevance by incorporating global context reference comparison with an anchor document.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pointwise ranking methods are efficient but fail to incorporate comparative insights between documents, leading to inconsistent and suboptimal relevance scoring.

Method: Introducing GCCP, which uses an anchor document based on a query-focused summary to provide global context for relevance comparison, and a training-free post-aggregation technique (PAGC).

Result: The method achieves significant improvements over existing pointwise ranking approaches in terms of effectiveness while maintaining comparable efficiency. It also performs competitively with computation-heavy comparative strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed GCCP and PAGC approaches effectively bridge the gap between efficiency and effectiveness in pointwise document ranking strategies by leveraging global context via anchor-based comparisons.

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

*Wei Chen,Giacomo Dimarco,Lorenzo Pareschi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method combining multiscale control variates and structure-preserving neural networks to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Monte Carlo sampling for stochastic kinetic equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the inefficiency and high variance of traditional Monte Carlo methods in handling high-dimensional kinetic equations under uncertainty.

Method: The method combines low-fidelity model-based multiscale control variates with structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs), trained on low-fidelity data but enriched with selective high-fidelity samples.

Result: The approach significantly reduces variance while preserving physical laws and achieves efficient large-scale predictions in kinetic uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The introduced framework enhances the computational efficiency and physical consistency of uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional kinetic equations, outperforming standard Monte Carlo methods.

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

TL;DR: The study uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to predict ocean ecosystem steady states, significantly reducing computational time for spin-up simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational time for ocean ecosystem model spin-ups by leveraging machine learning techniques.

Method: A CVAE with mass correction was trained on precomputed steady states and used to predict initial values for spin-ups.

Result: The CVAE predictions reduced spin-up iterations by 50–95%, depending on the stopping criterion, compared to uniform initial values.

Conclusion: Using CVAE predictions as spin-up initial values yields substantial computational savings compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

Motivation: Existing methods for predicting extreme weather events are computationally expensive or lack accuracy for simulating rare, impactful scenarios, especially under climate change.

Result: Applying NeuralGCM to the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave generated temperature anomalies up to 3.7°C higher than the most extreme outcomes of traditional methods. The model also identified key atmospheric mechanisms linked to severe heat events.

Conclusion: Differentiable climate models like NeuralGCM can accelerate and enhance the exploration of extreme weather likelihoods under climate change, offering new tools for targeted risk assessment and scenario planning.

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

*Simon Lang,Martin Leutbecher,Pedro Maciel*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces and evaluates a multi-scale loss formulation to improve probabilistic machine-learned weather forecasting models without compromising forecast accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address small-scale variability issues in weather forecasting models and improve their performance in representing diverse scale features.

Method: The study tests a multi-scale loss formulation on AIFS-CRPS, a model developed at ECMWF that directly optimizes the almost fair continuous ranked probability score (afCRPS).

Result: The multi-scale loss successfully enhances small-scale variability handling without reducing the forecast skill of the AIFS-CRPS model.

Conclusion: Using multi-scale loss formulations is a promising approach for scale-aware training in machine-learned weather forecasting models.

Abstract: We assess the impact of a multi-scale loss formulation for training
probabilistic machine-learned weather forecasting models. The multi-scale loss
is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed
at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is
trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability
score (afCRPS). The multi-scale loss better constrains small scale variability
without negatively impacting forecast skill. This opens up promising directions
for future work in scale-aware model training.

*Yusuke Fujita,Tomoya Mizumoto,Atsushi Kojima,Lianbo Liu,Yui Sudo*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces an audio comprehension model using LLMs to improve instruction-following and zero-shot capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the caption variation problem in audio comprehension models and enhance instruction-following capabilities.

Method: Train the model to simulate dialogue continuation based on input captions, leveraging large language models.

Result: The model showed zero-shot instruction-following abilities and performed well on multiple audio datasets and tests.

Conclusion: Dialogue continuation training effectively improves audio comprehension, capturing deeper caption meanings and enabling unseen instruction-following.

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

Motivation: Exploring a robust and efficient real-time voice conversion for applications such as communication and entertainment.

Method: RT-VC utilizes articulatory feature space for disentangling content and speaker traits, combined with differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) for efficient vocoding.

Result: The system achieves comparable synthesis quality to state-of-the-art methods with a CPU latency of 61.4 ms, reducing latency by 13.3%.

Conclusion: RT-VC establishes a significant improvement in voice conversion latency while maintaining high synthesis quality.

Abstract: Voice conversion has emerged as a pivotal technology in numerous applications
ranging from assistive communication to entertainment. In this paper, we
present RT-VC, a zero-shot real-time voice conversion system that delivers
ultra-low latency and high-quality performance. Our approach leverages an
articulatory feature space to naturally disentangle content and speaker
characteristics, facilitating more robust and interpretable voice
transformations. Additionally, the integration of differentiable digital signal
processing (DDSP) enables efficient vocoding directly from articulatory
features, significantly reducing conversion latency. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that, while maintaining synthesis quality comparable to the current

### [427] [Robust Unsupervised Adaptation of a Speech Recogniser Using Entropy Minimisation and Speaker Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10653)
*Rogier C. van Dalen,Shucong Zhang,Titouan Parcollet,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method that leverages conditional entropy over multiple hypotheses and speaker codes to better adapt speech recognizers to new speakers with limited data, demonstrating significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in adapting speech recognizers to new environments or speakers when only minimal and unlabelled data is available.

Method: The method involves using a novel loss function based on conditional entropy over multiple hypotheses to improve adaptation, and employing speaker codes—short vectors that efficiently characterize speakers.

Result: The proposed approach achieves a 20% relative improvement in word error rate with one minute of adaptation data, and a 29% improvement with 10 minutes on a noise-augmented test set.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques offer robust adaptation for speech recognizers in low-data, noisy scenarios, significantly enhancing performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: AniMaker, a multi-agent framework, generates text-based story-coherent animations through optimized clip generation, evaluation, and selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with creating coherent, multi-scene storytelling videos due to disjointed narratives and quality issues.

Method: AniMaker uses specialized agents for storyboard generation, clip production, evaluation, and editing. Its core technologies include MCTS-Gen for efficient clip generation and AniEval for multi-shot animation evaluation.

Result: AniMaker achieves superior storytelling animation quality and efficiency, with high performance on metrics like VBench and AniEval.

Conclusion: AniMaker bridges video generation and AI-driven storytelling, setting a new benchmark for generating text-to-animation visuals aligning with production standards.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper explores generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models under conditions like quasi-periodic disorder, non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving, analyzing their topological and localization features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the broadened behaviors of the SSH model when subjected to realistic and complex scenarios, such as disorder, non-Hermiticity, and dynamic modulation.

Method: The study uses exact diagonalization, numerical solvers, and unsupervised machine learning for analyzing spectral properties, localization (via IPR), and phase classification. Techniques like Floquet driving are also employed.

Result: The paper identifies phenomena such as topological edge state destruction by localization, the non-Hermitian skin effect, and Floquet-engineered edge states.

Conclusion: Generalized 1D SSH models host diverse phenomena, like destruction of topology by strong disorder and engineered Floquet topological phases, enriching our understanding of 1D topological insulators.

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper studies the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in next-generation solid-state batteries by conducting large-scale quantum-accurate simulations, revealing novel interface phenomena and valuable insights into atomistic dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand and control atomistic-level reactions in the SEI formation of solid-state batteries, a critical challenge in making these batteries viable due to experimental limitations and simulation constraints.

Method: They use active learning and deep equivariant neural networks to enable precise large-scale reactive simulations. Unsupervised clustering techniques are employed to automatically characterize atomic interactions in the SEI.

Result: The paper identifies a new crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, that had been missed by prior thermodynamic predictions. Their simulations also align with experiments, explaining SEI formation mechanisms and revealing Li motion critical to dendrite initiation.

Conclusion: Explicit, first-principles modeling without experimental fitting sheds light on SEI processes and atomistic dynamics, offering a robust tool to study complex reactions in solid-state batteries and related fields.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

Motivation: Sandboxing can prevent exploited processes from being abused, but it is underutilized due to challenges developers face. The study aims to identify these issues.

Method: A usability trial was conducted with 7 experienced Seccomp developers, observing how they approached and implemented sandboxing solutions.

Result: Developers adopted varied approaches and reached different solutions, highlighting challenges and inconsistencies in using Seccomp for sandboxing.

TL;DR: This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect software vulnerabilities in Python code, finding that few-shot prompting significantly improves performance over zero-shot approaches, especially with confidence-based routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the increasing sophistication of cyber threats by exploring rapid and accurate LLM-based methods for software vulnerability detection.

Method: The study compares zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot in-domain prompting strategies, and integrates confidence-based routing to guide human intervention in cases of high model uncertainty.

Result: Few-shot prompting with confidence-based routing enhances classification performance and improves efficiency, demonstrating LLMs' ability to generalize across vulnerability categories with minimal examples.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as scalable cybersecurity tools, but issues like reliability, interpretability, and adversarial robustness must be addressed. Expert-in-the-loop workflows are highlighted as a promising path forward.

Abstract: As cyber threats become more sophisticated, rapid and accurate vulnerability
detection is essential for maintaining secure systems. This study explores the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software vulnerability assessment by
simulating the identification of Python code with known Common Weakness
Enumerations (CWEs), comparing zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot
in-domain prompting strategies. Our results indicate that while zero-shot
prompting performs poorly, few-shot prompting significantly enhances
classification performance, particularly when integrated with confidence-based
routing strategies that improve efficiency by directing human experts to cases
where model uncertainty is high, optimizing the balance between automation and
expert oversight. We find that LLMs can effectively generalize across
vulnerability categories with minimal examples, suggesting their potential as
scalable, adaptable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments. However,
challenges such as model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial
robustness remain critical areas for future research. By integrating AI-driven
approaches with expert-in-the-loop (EITL) decision-making, this work highlights
a pathway toward more efficient and responsive cybersecurity workflows. Our
findings provide a foundation for deploying AI-assisted vulnerability detection
systems in both real and simulated environments that enhance operational

TL;DR: D-LiFT enhances decompiler outputs using reinforcement learning with LLMs, focusing on preserving accuracy and improving readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decompilers are essential in security tasks but suffer from issues like syntactic and semantic errors, making outputs hard to read.

Method: D-LiFT uses reinforcement learning with LLMs and a scoring system, D-SCORE, to ensure accurate and readable decompiled code.

Result: D-LiFT boosts the readability and accuracy of decompiled functions, showing a 55.3% improvement compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: D-LiFT demonstrates potential in improving decompiler outputs by balancing accuracy and readability, marking progress in security-related tasks.

Abstract: Decompilers, which reconstruct human-readable source code from binary
executables, are vital to many security tasks. Yet, despite recent advances,
their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains
difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),
researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.
Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,
such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.
In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that
harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving
accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of
decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.
Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system
to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,
D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher
scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,
D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler
and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then
evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with
the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for
fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,
demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the
coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without
D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled
functions, as measured by D-SCORE.

*Chuyang Chen,Brendan Dolan-Gavitt,Zhiqiang Lin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ELFuzz is a novel approach leveraging large language models to automate and improve generation-based fuzzing, achieving superior bug detection and test coverage compared to manual and state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual construction of input grammars and semantic constraints for generation-based fuzzing is time-consuming and labor-intensive, necessitating a more automated approach.

Method: ELFuzz uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize generation-based fuzzers. Starting with minimal seed fuzzers, it employs LLM-driven automated evolution guided by coverage metrics.

Result: ELFuzz demonstrated up to 434.8% better code coverage and triggered up to 174.0% more bugs in comparison to expert-written and state-of-the-art methods. It discovered five 0-day bugs in real-world software during a campaign.

Conclusion: ELFuzz is a highly effective, scalable, and automated fuzzing solution that synthesizes grammatically and semantically rich fuzzers. It has significant potential for advancing the domain of automated software testing.

Abstract: Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to
specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and
software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to
construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large
Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based
fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over
fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels
the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.
Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of
real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)
synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and
semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared
ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized
by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more
coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also
used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of
cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are
exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the
fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to
62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers
synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical
structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results
present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and
extensible input generation for fuzzing.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a novel framework for generating synthetic data to align large language models (LLMs) safely, by repurposing attack techniques to elicit harmful completions and improving model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-labeled preference data for aligning LLMs is costly and time-consuming, prompting the need for scalable and efficient alternatives like synthetic data.

Method: RAAI detects internal refusal signals in LLMs and injects predefined phrases to provoke harmful yet fluent responses, enabling synthetic harmful data generation without iterative procedures or auxiliary models.

Result: Using RAAI, harmful response rates increased from a baseline of 2.15% to 61.04% across benchmarks. Fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data enhanced robustness against harmful prompts while retaining performance on standard tasks.

Conclusion: RAAI transforms LLM attack methods into tools for scalable safety alignment, emphasizing its utility in generating synthetic data to improve LLMs' safety and robustness efficiently.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces MalwareBench to evaluate how large language models (LLMs) handle jailbreaking prompts for generating malicious code, finding that their rejection rates are inadequate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about the security of LLMs, especially their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks aimed at generating harmful code, necessitated a deeper examination.

Method: The authors created MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset with 3,520 prompts derived from 320 malicious code requirements, spanning 11 attack methods and 29 functionality categories.

Result: Mainstream LLMs showed an average rejection rate of 60.93%, which drops to 39.92% when exposed to combined jailbreak methods, showing significant underperformance in handling malicious prompts.

Conclusion: Current LLMs demonstrate substantial weaknesses in rejecting malicious code-generation requirements, indicating the need for improved security measures.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called Private Memorization Editing (PME) to prevent private data leakage in Large Language Models (LLMs) by editing the model's knowledge of its training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of LLMs leaking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) due to their memorization capabilities.

Method: They identify memorized PII within the LLMs and modify the model's memory of training data to prevent leakage without altering the model's overall functionality.

Result: The PME approach reduces the likelihood of leaking PII, even lowering the effectiveness of privacy attacks to zero in certain configurations.

Conclusion: PME is a promising strategy for protecting privacy in LLMs by transforming their memorization ability into a defensive mechanism.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

*Tianyu Chen,Jian Lou,Wenjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AQUA, a watermark framework designed for copyright protection of image data in Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of protection for image data in RAG systems, which is essential for safeguarding shared knowledge bases and contributed data.

Method: AQUA embeds watermarks into synthetic images through two methods: acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues, ensuring robustness and imperceptibility.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that AQUA provides effective, stealthy, and reliable protection against copyright breaches across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: AQUA fills a critical gap in multimodal RAG systems by enabling robust copyright tracing and protecting image knowledge.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

*Saswat Das,Jameson Sandler,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces an auditing framework to evaluate privacy vulnerabilities in conversational agents via multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing concern of privacy risks in large language model agents that have access to sensitive data.

Method: The authors propose CMPL, a framework that employs iterative probing to simulate multi-turn interactions for detecting privacy vulnerabilities.

Result: The evaluation of CMPL across various domains and configurations exposes privacy risks that single-turn defenses fail to mitigate.

Conclusion: CMPL proves effective for diagnosing privacy risks and provides metrics for evaluation, advocating for better privacy auditing in conversational agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

### [441] [GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047)
*Zilong Wang,Xiang Zheng,Xiaosen Wang,Bo Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Text-to-image (T2I) models face misuse risks like generating harmful content despite safety mechanisms. GenBreak offers a framework to test and reveal vulnerabilities via refined adversarial prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks effective evaluation tools for the safety of T2I models against adversarial exploitation and harmful image generation.

Method: Fine-tuning a red-team large language model (LLM) using supervised learning and reinforcement learning, incorporating various reward signals to craft effective adversarial prompts.

Result: GenBreak-generated prompts effectively bypass safety filters and create harmful outputs while maintaining semantic coherence in black-box attacks.

Conclusion: GenBreak reveals critical safety vulnerabilities in commercial T2I models, emphasizing the need for robust safety measures in the future.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the vulnerability of machine unlearning methods to prompt attacks, identifying weaknesses and proposing a robust evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the efficacy of machine unlearning methods and understand their vulnerability to prompt attacks.

Method: Eight unlearning techniques across three model families were systematically analyzed using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis.

Result: Robust unlearning was observed in methods like RMU and TAR, while methods like ELM showed vulnerabilities, such as recovering high accuracy with specific prompts.

Conclusion: Machine unlearning methods may not fully delete knowledge as assumed, necessitating more effective evaluation frameworks for true knowledge removal.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs can involve private or sensitive data, posing privacy risks. The paper aims to understand and address these issues by studying MIAs on LLMs.

Method: The method includes an empirical study of MIAs on fine-tuned LLMs and introduces SOFT, a defense technique using selective data obfuscation with an adjustable parameter to balance privacy and utility.

Result: Experiments across six domains and multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks and preserves model performance.

Conclusion: SOFT offers a scalable and practical solution to mitigate privacy leakage in fine-tuned LLMs while maintaining competitive utility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of joint specification and systematic evaluation of multi-agent systems utilizing LLMs for specific applications.

Method: The authors propose an extended system architecture from prior research, introduce specifications for multi-agent LLM systems, and test using cybersecurity tasks, leveraging models from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Result: The exploratory research demonstrates the feasibility of completing question answering, server security, and network security tasks via agents powered by LLMs, showcasing their effectiveness.

Conclusion: Multi-agent systems with LLMs have potential for practical applications in specialized domains, particularly cybersecurity, and systematic evaluations enhance their applicability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of quantum cryptography, including QKD, BB84, and QOTP protocols, to secure data in cloud computing environments against traditional and quantum-powered threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition to cloud computing has made data storage and access convenient but has also increased security challenges, especially with the advent of quantum computing, which can compromise traditional encryption methods.

Method: The researchers use the BB84 protocol for generating secure keys via quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and employ Quantum One Time Pad (QOTP) encryption to ensure data privacy in cloud environments.

Result: The study demonstrates that applying quantum cryptography methods such as QKD and QOTP effectively enhances data security, even in the presence of quantum computing threats.

Conclusion: The integration of quantum cryptography in cloud systems offers a robust solution for ensuring long-term data security, making cloud environments safer against current and future security breaches.

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even
if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and
QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for
everyone to store their data securely and safely.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on analyzing and categorizing methods to safeguard large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks by proposing a taxonomy and evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure the safe deployment of LLMs by addressing their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks and the fragmented nature of current defensive mechanisms.

Method: Develop a multi-dimensional taxonomy and a Security-Efficiency-Utility framework to analyze and evaluate different LLM guardrails systematically.

Result: Identified strengths, weaknesses, and universality of guardrail approaches through experimental analysis; provided insights for optimizing defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: This study establishes a structured foundation for future research on LLM safety by providing a taxonomy, evaluation framework, and practical insights for deploying effective and robust guardrails.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

*Xiaoxing Mo,Yuxuan Cheng,Nan Sun,Leo Yu Zhang,Wei Luo,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes TED-LaST, a robust defense mechanism to counter adaptive backdoor attacks in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current defense mechanism, Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED), is vulnerable to adaptable backdoor attacks that target topological representation distributions in neural networks.

Method: TED-LaST enhances TED with label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis to counteract sophisticated adaptive backdoor attacks.

Result: Experiments on various datasets and architectures demonstrate that TED-LaST effectively counters advanced backdoor methods like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch, and newly proposed adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: TED-LaST establishes a new standard for robust detection and defense against evolving backdoor threats in DNNs, significantly improving model security.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in generative diffusion models being susceptible to copyright infringement attacks, introduces new datasets, and proposes the Multi-Element attack method enhanced with Discrete Cosine Transform, achieving improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explores the vulnerabilities of generative diffusion models to copyright infringement attacks and the inadequacies of current methods and datasets, prompting the need for new solutions.

Method: Introduces new datasets and proposes a Multi-Element attack method that increases the poisonous visual-text elements in samples, combined with a Discrete Cosine Transform for stealthiness.

Result: Achieved better attack performance metrics, like higher Copyright Infringement Rates and reduced First Attack Epochs, outperforming benchmarks even under low subsampling conditions.

Conclusion: New datasets and the novel Multi-Element method show promising improvements in launching and enhancing copyright infringement attacks on diffusion models.

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

*Junhua Lin,Marc Juarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a targeted attack against the Tree-Ring watermarking technique for diffusion models, achieving superior results even with minimal access, by leveraging public variational autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities in Tree-Ring watermarking techniques, highlighting risks in reusing public variational autoencoders for training diffusion models.

Method: The proposed attack exploits publicly available variational autoencoders to approximate the target model's latent space, enabling effective watermark removal without full model access.

Result: The attack significantly lowers the effectiveness of Tree-Ring detectors, reducing AUC scores from 0.993 to 0.153 (ROC) and 0.994 to 0.385 (PR), while preserving image quality.

Conclusion: Reusing public autoencoders poses a serious security risk for diffusion models, and the Tree-Ring detector may not meet real-world reliability requirements due to its precision shortcomings.

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

*Stefano Longari,Paolo Cerracchio,Michele Carminati,Stefano Zanero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study examines adversarial attacks that can bypass Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in vehicle networks, emphasizing the role of attacker knowledge and dataset quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vulnerability of vehicle communication systems, particularly the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, to cyberattacks, necessitates research into the robustness of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs).

Method: The paper analyzes gradient-based adversarial attacks with varying levels of attacker knowledge (white-box, grey-box, and black-box) against state-of-the-art automotive IDSs, using publicly available datasets.

Result: The findings reveal that adversarial attacks' success depends on the quality of datasets, the specific IDS targeted, and the extent of the attacker's knowledge.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks in automotive contexts are challenging but feasible, highlighting the need for improved dataset quality and IDS designs to mitigate such risks.

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses decomposition attacks on LLM safety defenses by proposing a lightweight monitor observing conversation sequences, achieving a high defense rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety defenses fail to detect malicious intents when they are decomposed into seemingly benign subtasks, leaving LLMs vulnerable to attacks.

Method: The authors curated a large dataset to study decomposition attacks and proposed a lightweight sequential monitoring framework to evaluate subtasks cumulatively in real time.

Result: Experiments showed decomposition attacks had an 87% success rate on GPT-4, but the proposed lightweight monitor achieved a 93% success rate in defense, being cost-efficient and robust.

Conclusion: Lightweight sequential monitors provide an effective and efficient defense against decomposition attacks, making them feasible for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

### [453] [EQ-TAA: Equivariant Traffic Accident Anticipation via Diffusion-Based Accident Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10002)
*Jianwu Fang,Lei-Lei Li,Zhedong Zheng,Hongkai Yu,Jianru Xue,Zhengguo Li,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model to address Traffic Accident Anticipation by synthesizing causal video clips and circumventing issues of biased data and annotation demand.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of existing supervised learning approaches for Traffic Accident Anticipation, like annotation challenges and background confounding due to biased data.

Method: The authors propose an Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model to synthesize causal frames of accident scenarios and Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with equivariant triple loss for robust anticipation using generated video pairs.

Result: AVD successfully generates realistic accident video clips without needing additional annotations, and EQ-TAA achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in Traffic Accident Anticipation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that synthesizing causal accident footage with AVD enhances Traffic Accident Anticipation, and EQ-TAA provides a promising framework for improving accident prediction in traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

### [455] [HER2 Expression Prediction with Flexible Multi-Modal Inputs via Dynamic Bidirectional Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10006)
*Jie Qin,Wei Yang,Yan Su,Yiran Zhu,Weizhen Li,Yunyue Pan,Chengchang Pan,Honggang Qi*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bimodal framework for HER2 predictions in breast cancer using H&E and IHC imaging, enabling accurate, adaptable analysis even in resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HER2 assessment models rely on either H&E or IHC imaging in isolation, but these modalities complement each other in clinical interpretation, and synchronous acquisition is challenging due to cost and complexity.

Method: The proposed framework consists of three main innovations: (1) a dynamic branch selector for flexible input handling, (2) a bidirectional cross-modal GAN for feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities, and (3) a hybrid training protocol combining adversarial learning and multi-task optimization.

Result: The framework improves single-modality prediction accuracy (e.g., H&E accuracy rises to 94.25%, dual-modality accuracy reaches 95.09%) and enhances cross-modal reconstruction (F1-scores of 0.9609 for H&E-to-IHC and 0.9251 for IHC-to-H&E). It also significantly reduces computational cost by 78.55%, making it efficient.

Conclusion: This elastic design mitigates performance loss due to missing data and reduces costs, enabling reliable HER2 assessments in diverse and resource-limited healthcare settings while approaching the performance of dual-modality systems.

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

*Kangwei Liu,Junwu Liu,Xiaowei Yi,Jinlin Guo,Yun Cao*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diffusion-based framework for audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation, addressing challenges with single-modal control signals and deterministic mappings by leveraging multimodal emotion binding and an attention-based latent diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D facial animation rely heavily on single-modal control signals (e.g., videos or text) and deterministic regression techniques, which limit expressiveness and cannot account for the stochastic nature of emotional expressions.

Method: The authors introduce a framework with two key innovations: (1) a multimodal emotion binding strategy leveraging contrastive learning to align different modalities (text, audio, and emotion data), and (2) a latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and emotion-guided layers to ensure diverse, expressive, and temporally coherent facial animations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate a 21.6% improvement in emotion similarity while maintaining realistic facial motion and temporal coherence, outperforming previous methods across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study advances the field by introducing a multimodal and stochastic framework that enhances the expressiveness, emotion similarity, and naturalness of 3D facial animations, bridging gaps in existing methodologies.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical knowledge graph framework to analyze visual narratives like comics by connecting visual and textual components for tasks such as dialogue tracing and event progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a structured understanding of visual narratives in multimodal media like comics, which involve complex relationships between visual and textual components.

Method: The method involves generating hierarchical knowledge graphs at multiple levels (macro to micro), capturing semantic, spatial, and temporal relationships in visual narratives from the panel level to overall story arcs.

Result: The framework, applied on a subset of the Manga109 dataset, showed strong performance in tasks such as action retrieval, dialogue tracing, and timeline reconstruction with high precision and recall.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable and interpretable foundation for narrative-based content analysis and supports reasoning across various narrative tasks in visual media.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

*Weiyin Gong,Kai Zhang,Yanghai Zhang,Qi Liu,Xinjie Sun,Junyu Lu,Linbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition (WDMIR) framework that improves verbal and non-verbal intent understanding using frequency-domain analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recognizing user intent effectively often requires integrating verbal and non-verbal signals. Current methods prioritize text but neglect non-verbal cues' semantic richness, necessitating a more balanced multimodal approach.

Method: The paper proposes a novel WDMIR framework with (1) a wavelet-driven fusion module for synchronized decomposition and integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, and (2) a cross-modal interaction mechanism for progressive verbal and non-verbal feature enhancement.

Result: The proposed WDMIR framework achieves state-of-the-art intent recognition performance, improving accuracy by 1.13% compared to previous approaches and boosting semantic extraction by 0.41% in ablation studies.

Conclusion: Wavelet-based multimodal analysis enables more effective integration of verbal and non-verbal cues, offering clear performance improvements in recognizing subtle user intent patterns.

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Motivation: To provide a unified perspective on the development of MLLMs and identify critical paths for creating more versatile, interpretable, and general-purpose multimodal systems.

Method: Analyzed six primary generative modalities, foundational techniques like SSL, MoE, RLHF, and CoT prompting, architectural innovations (transformers, diffusion models), and emerging synergies.

Result: Key models and architectural trends are detailed, along with insights into transferable techniques, emergent cross-modal synergies, and challenges in evaluation, modularity, and reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

### [460] [Multimodal Emotion Coupling via Speech-to-Facial and Bodily Gestures in Dyadic Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10010)
*Von Ralph Dane Marquez Herbuela,Yukie Nagai*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This study analyzes how emotional speech connects to facial and hand movements during interactions, using motion capture and speech analysis. It highlights the role of conversational dynamics like turn-taking and overlapping speech in emotional communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how emotional and behavioral cues are communicated in real-world interactions by analyzing the interplay of speech, facial, and hand movements.

Method: The study uses motion capture data from dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus, analyzing speech features (like prosody, MFCCs, arousal, valence) alongside 3D facial and hand marker data to study expressive activeness and speech-gesture coordination.

Result: Nonoverlapping speech led to greater expressivity, particularly in the mouth. Sadness increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed gestures with overlaps. Predictive mapping showed prosody and MFCCs were most accurate for facial regions, while arousal and valence had more context-sensitive correlations. Hand-speech synchrony was enhanced with low arousal and overlapping speech.

Conclusion: Conversational dynamics affect how emotional and multimodal signals are expressed. Understanding these patterns can improve real-time emotion detection systems in human interactions and AI.

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

*Abiodun Ganiyu,Pranshav Gajjar,Vijay K Shah*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI5GTest, an AI-powered framework for automating the validation of O-RAN components, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline and improve testing processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies, fragmentation, and human error in existing O-RAN component testing frameworks by introducing a more scalable, consistent, and automated solution.

Method: The authors propose AI5GTest, a framework that uses three LLMs: Gen-LLM for generating procedural flows, Val-LLM for validating compliance with specifications, and Debug-LLM for anomaly analysis. It includes a human-in-the-loop mechanism for transparency.

Result: AI5GTest significantly reduces test execution time while maintaining high validation accuracy, as demonstrated on test cases from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT specifications.

Conclusion: AI5GTest resolves many challenges of O-RAN component testing by providing an efficient, accurate, and AI-driven solution with improved scalability and reduced human dependence.

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an advanced extension to the Space-O-RAN wireless communication system designed for lunar operations by incorporating an intelligent, context-aware decision-making layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wireless systems for lunar operations rely on static policies and lack semantic integration, making it challenging to adapt to dynamic mission and environmental requirements.

Method: The paper introduces a semantic agentic layer using the MCP and A2A communication protocols to enable distributed cognitive agents on rovers, landers, and base stations for adaptive decision-making.

Result: The extended system applies strategies like delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic compression while interacting with MCP servers to optimize telemetry and mission planning.

Conclusion: Integrating a semantic layer enhances wireless communication systems for lunar missions, improving their adaptability and robustness under dynamic conditions.

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight deep learning method for energy-efficient traffic classification on microcontrollers, achieving high accuracy and low computational overhead, ensuring feasibility for IoT applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of energy efficiency, high accuracy, and real-world deployability of traffic classification models within IoT systems that rely on resource-constrained devices like microcontrollers.

Method: The paper developed a lightweight 1D-CNN optimized using hardware-aware neural architecture search and quantized the model to INT8 for deployment on real-world microcontrollers.

Result: The optimized model achieved 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with low computational requirements (e.g., 10.08M FLOPs) and real-world deployment on microcontrollers demonstrated inference latencies of 31.43ms and 115.40ms with low energy consumption.

Conclusion: The results confirm the practical feasibility of deploying encrypted traffic classification models on microcontrollers, enabling low-power and scalable IoT security solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for
energy-efficient traffic classification (TC) on resource-limited
microcontrollers, which are widely used in IoT-based smart systems and
communication networks. Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight
1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which
achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K
parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations
(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies
ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted
traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security
solutions.
