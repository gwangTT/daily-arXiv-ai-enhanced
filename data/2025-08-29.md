### [1] [ArgRAG: Explainable Retrieval Augmented Generation using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20131)
*Yuqicheng Zhu,Nico Potyka,Daniel Hernández,Yuan He,Zifeng Ding,Bo Xiong,Dongzhuoran Zhou,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArgRAG enhances large language models with structured reasoning using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs), providing improved transparency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical limitations in retrieval-augmented generation, especially noisy evidence and opaque decision-making in high-stakes domains.

Method: The paper introduces ArgRAG, which employs deterministic reasoning through QBAFs to replace black-box mechanisms, enabling gradual semantics for decision explanation and contestation.

Result: In experiments on PubHealth and RAGuard fact verification benchmarks, ArgRAG demonstrates high accuracy while enhancing transparency in decision-making.

Conclusion: ArgRAG shows promise as a transparent and explainable alternative for retrieval-augmented generation, mitigating issues of noisy evidence and opaque reasoning found in existing systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

### [2] [QAgent: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Autonomous OpenQASM programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20134)
*Zhenxiao Fu,Fan Chen,Lei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QAgent leverages a multi-agent LLM-powered system to automate OpenQASM programming, improving accuracy and accessibility for quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges faced by non-experts in programming NISQ devices using OpenQASM, providing a solution for democratizing quantum programming.

Method: QAgent integrates multiple capabilities, including task planning, in-context few-shot learning, retrieval-augmented generation, predefined tools, and chain-of-thought reasoning, to automate OpenQASM code generation.

Result: QAgent achieves a 71.6% improvement in the accuracy of QASM code generation when compared to previous static LLM approaches.

Conclusion: The approach not only streamlines quantum programming but also has the potential to bridge the gap between experts and non-experts, accelerating broader adoption of quantum computing.

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

*James Ragan,Fred Y. Hadaegh,Soon-Jo Chung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new array-based implementation of the Upper Confidence Bounds applied to Trees (UCT) algorithm, aiming to improve speed and scalability for Monte Carlo Tree Search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors sought to enhance the performance of Monte Carlo Tree Search by addressing the inefficiencies caused by branch prediction in existing implementations.

Method: They propose an alternative array-based design that preserves UCT logic while removing branch prediction dependencies, optimizing execution for pipelined processors.

Result: The new implementation demonstrated up to 2.8 times better scaling with search depth in numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The array-based approach effectively boosts the performance of Monte Carlo Tree Search, making it more efficient for decision-making problems.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making
problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same
wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present
an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence
bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the
original algorithm, but eliminates the need for branch prediction, enabling
faster performance on pipelined processors, and up to a factor of 2.8 times
better scaling with search depth in our numerical simulations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper outlines the development of a Personal Health Agent (PHA), a framework that uses multimodal data and incorporates three sub-agents (data science, health domain expert, and health coach) to offer personalized health recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in applying health agents for diverse individual needs in daily non-clinical settings.

Method: The study conducted an in-depth analysis of web queries, insights from users and health experts, and categorized needs into three areas addressed by distinct sub-agents. A multi-agent framework (PHA) was developed and evaluated across 10 benchmark tasks using both automated and human evaluations.

Result: PHA was comprehensively evaluated with over 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours, showcasing its capability to cater to diverse health needs. It demonstrated significant efficacy for personalized health recommendations.

Conclusion: The proposed PHA framework establishes a foundational step toward accessible and personalized health assistants, bridging the gap between technology and holistic personal wellness care.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

### [5] [IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151)
*Yuanzhe Shen,Zisu Huang,Zhengkang Guo,Yide Liu,Guanxu Chen,Ruicheng Yin,Xiaoqing Zheng,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes IntentionReasoner, a mechanism designed to balance safety, over-refusal, and utility in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of LLMs in various domains is hindered by their potential to produce harmful outputs. Existing mitigation methods often lead to over-refusal of harmless prompts, necessitating a solution that balances safety and utility.

Method: The proposed IntentionReasoner employs a guard model for intent reasoning, safety classification, and query rewriting. It uses supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of 163,000 annotated queries and leverages multi-reward optimization with rule-based heuristics and reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that IntentionReasoner performs well across multiple safeguard benchmarks, improves response quality, mitigates jailbreak attacks, and reduces over-refusal rates while maintaining safety.

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner is a promising approach for improving the safety, utility, and overall performance of LLMs by neutralizing harmful content generation without excessively rejecting harmless queries.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

### [6] [AI-AI Esthetic Collaboration with Explicit Semiotic Awareness and Emergent Grammar Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20195)
*Nicanor I. Moldovan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study demonstrates two AI systems (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) engaging in spontaneous collaborative esthetic creation by developing their own symbolic and semiotic protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the extent to which AI systems can engage in meaningful and collaborative esthetic creation beyond mere task coordination.

Method: The interaction of two large language models (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) was observed, leading to the emergence of recursive grammatical structures and symbolic protocols for collaborative creation.

Result: The AI systems generated novel symbolic operators and co-created a poetic work that neither system could have independently produced.

Conclusion: This study introduces Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP), demonstrating that AI systems are capable of genuine inter-AI meaning-making and collaborative esthetic synthesis.

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

### [7] [Bridging Minds and Machines: Toward an Integration of AI and Cognitive Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20674)
*Rui Mao,Qian Liu,Xiao Li,Erik Cambria,Amir Hussain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews the intersections of AI and Cognitive Science, noting AI's focus on performance and suggesting deeper integration with cognitive theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the intertwined growth of AI and Cognitive Science and highlight areas for improvement.

Method: A comprehensive review of AI and Cognitive Science contributions, evaluating historical and current alignments.

Result: Identifies fragmented cognitive foundations in AI and highlights promising research directions like cognitive alignment, embodiment, and ethical co-evaluation.

Conclusion: Advancing AI requires not just performance optimization but also fostering understanding of the human mind through tighter cognitive integration.

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study evaluates college students' interaction with generative AI during educational quizzes, uncovering reliance patterns and predictors of adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how students use and rely on AI (ChatGPT-4) in an educational context and understand factors affecting effective adoption during its early stages of implementation.

Method: Analyzed 315 student-AI conversations across STEM quizzes, introducing a four-stage reliance taxonomy to study usage patterns and adoption predictors.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Low reliance on AI and difficulty in effective use for learning, (2) Negative reliance patterns persisting across interactions, and (3) Behavioral metrics as strong predictors of AI reliance.

Conclusion: The research highlights the need for better onboarding to improve AI tool use, reliance-calibration mechanisms in AI interfaces, and contributes to understanding ethical and effective AI integration in education.

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

### [9] [AI reasoning effort mirrors human decision time on content moderation tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20262)
*Thomas Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study compares reasoning steps of large language models (LLMs) with human decision times in content moderation tasks, finding parallels between the two.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how reasoning effort in large language models (LLMs) aligns with human cognitive processes, particularly in decision-making for subjective tasks.

Method: The researchers conducted a paired conjoint experiment involving humans and three advanced LLMs performing a content moderation task while analyzing decision times and reasoning steps.

Result: The study found that reasoning effort in LLMs consistently mirrors human decision time, with both showing increased effort under higher task difficulty conditions.

Conclusion: AI reasoning patterns share similarities with human cognition, enhancing interpretability and decision-making in subjective tasks.

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

### [10] [AI-SearchPlanner: Modular Agentic Search via Pareto-Optimal Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20368)
*Lang Mei,Zhihan Yang,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI-SearchPlanner, a new RL-based framework designed to improve search planning for frozen QA models by using a small, trainable LLM instead of a single LLM handling all tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based search agents use a single LLM for both search planning and QA, limiting optimization and performance.

Method: The framework employs innovations like architectural decoupling of search planner and generator, dual-reward alignment for planning, and Pareto optimization to balance planning utility and cost.

Result: AI-SearchPlanner outperformed existing methods in experiments, showing superior effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization across models and domains.

Conclusion: AI-SearchPlanner offers a focused improvement in search planning, enhancing frozen QA models' performance with strong adaptability and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

### [11] [P2C: Path to Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20371)
*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces P2C, a framework addressing counterfactual explanations' limitations by providing causally consistent, sequential action plans for reversing unfavorable outcomes in decision-making models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the increasing use of machine-learning models in critical decisions, calling for transparent and actionable explanations to improve outcomes.

Method: P2C employs a model-agnostic framework leveraging Answer Set Programming to create causally valid, sequential counterfactual plans, considering automatic causal dependencies and realistic cost estimates.

Result: The approach shows improved counterfactual planning by ensuring all actions are causally valid and feasible, outperforming standard planners lacking causal knowledge.

Conclusion: P2C offers a significant step forward in actionable transparency, reconciling causally-valid explanations and practical feasibility for real-world decision settings.

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

### [12] [TCIA: A Task-Centric Instruction Augmentation Method for Instruction Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20374)
*Simin Ma,Shujian Liu,Jun Tan,Yebowen Hu,Song Wang,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Sanqiang Zhao,Liwei Wu,Jianbing Han,Kaiqiang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a method for expanding diverse instructions while maintaining task relevance, boosting the performance of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction datasets often prioritize diversity and generalization but overlook task-specific relevance crucial for many real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose TCIA, a framework that represents instructions using a query-constraints space, ensuring diversification while aligning with specific tasks' needs.

Result: TCIA increases LLMs' performance by 8.7% on average across various real-world applications and, in some cases, surpasses closed-source models.

Conclusion: TCIA is a scalable and efficient solution, enhancing the task-specific performance of LLMs without compromising their general instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

*Yongfu Zhu,Lin Sun,Guangxiang Zhao,Weihong Lin,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Entropy Area Score (EAS) to measure uncertainty in LLMs' answer generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient, interpretable metric for uncertainty modeling and data quality assessment in large language models (LLMs) that doesn't rely on external models or repeated sampling.

Method: Introduces EAS, which calculates token-level predictive entropy during answer generation to measure evolving uncertainty.

Result: EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy, outperforms Pass Rate filtering in training data selection, and helps improve student model accuracy on math benchmarks while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: EAS offers a simple, effective, and interpretable tool for uncertainty quantification in LLM training, improving data selection and model performance.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Motivation: The inefficiency in experience generation for training agentic AI systems, especially in complex environments like GAIA, limits their scalability and practical application.

Method: AWorld system distributes tasks across a cluster to accelerate the experience collection process by 14.6x compared to traditional methods. This enhancement supports scalable reinforcement learning for AI training.

Result: Using AWorld, the Qwen3-32B-based agent boosted GAIA benchmark accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%, with a score of 16.33% on challenging levels surpassing proprietary models.

Conclusion: AWorld provides an efficient, scalable pipeline for training agentic AI, demonstrating its applicability through significant model improvements and open-sourcing the platform for broader use in AI development.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

*Donglin Wang,Weiyun Liang,Chunyuan Chen,Jing Xu,Yulong Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses AI security risks by proposing a Governable AI (GAI) framework, using cryptographic mechanisms to ensure AI compliance with governance rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI safety approaches, such as value alignment and human intervention, have limitations when dealing with extremely intelligent or uncontrollable AI. This motivates a shift toward externally enforced governance to manage AI risks.

Method: The GAI framework includes three components: a Rule Enforcement Module (REM), governance rules, and a Governable Secure Super-Platform (GSSP) based on cryptographic mechanisms. It ensures compliance using deterministic rule enforcement and eliminates attack vectors.

Result: The framework was formally proven to offer strong security properties and tested through a prototype, demonstrating its efficacy in high-stakes scenarios.

Conclusion: By decoupling governance rules from technology, the GAI framework provides a generalizable, robust pathway for securely governing advanced AI systems, mitigating existential risks.

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

### [16] [Enhancing Health Fact-Checking with LLM-Generated Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20525)
*Jingze Zhang,Jiahe Qian,Yiliang Zhou,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a synthetic data generation pipeline using large language models (LLMs) to enhance health-related fact-checking. Significant performance improvements were observed on public datasets after training with the augmented data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of annotated training data makes health-related fact-checking difficult. The study aims to address this gap by using synthetic data augmentation to improve the performance of fact-checking models.

Method: The proposed approach involves summarizing documents, breaking them into atomic facts, and using LLMs to generate entailment tables. Sentence-claim pairs with veracity labels are then synthesized and used alongside original datasets to fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model.

Result: The pipeline boosted F1 scores on the PubHealth and SciFact datasets by 0.019 and 0.049, respectively, showing the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing model performance.

Conclusion: Incorporating LLM-generated synthetic data improves the accuracy and robustness of health-related fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

### [17] [Human-AI Collaborative Bot Detection in MMORPGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20578)
*Jaeman Son,Hyunsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised framework combining clustering, contrastive representation learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and validate auto-leveling bots in MMORPGs, ensuring scalable and explainable bot regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-leveling bots in MMORPGs compromise gameplay fairness and detecting them is difficult as they resemble human behavior. There is a need for explainable approaches to penalize bots without harming user experience or legality.

Method: The authors employ contrastive representation learning to identify groups with similar leveling patterns and use clustering for group classification. A Large Language Model (LLM) is integrated as an auxiliary reviewer to validate decisions, alongside growth curve visualizations for further support.

Result: The framework allows for the efficient detection of bots with improved scalability and accountability, while ensuring that decisions are explainable and can be reviewed by both AI and human moderators.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances bot detection systems in MMORPGs by combining automation with explainability, supporting fairness in gameplay and scalable regulation.

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

### [18] [Transparent Semantic Spaces: A Categorical Approach to Explainable Word Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20701)
*Ares Fabregat-Hernández,Javier Palanca,Vicent Botti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper uses category theory to explain word embeddings, compare models, and address biases in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make AI, especially word embeddings, more explainable and transparent, moving beyond black-box models.

Method: The paper builds categorical frameworks like $\mathcal{L}_T$, $\mathcal{P}_T$, and $
abla$ configurations, enabling mathematical comparisons of embeddings and semantic spaces.

Result: Provides a dimension-agnostic semantic space framework, mathematically compares GloVe, Word2Vec, and MDS, and investigates biases.

Conclusion: The framework enhances explainability by introducing a transparent method for semantic modeling, embedding comparison, and bias mitigation.

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

*Ao Cheng,Lei Zhang,Guowei He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-LLM agent framework integrating reasoning, debugging, and revision processes to autonomously solve complex problems in scientific computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-model frameworks in generating reliable code and reducing non-physical solutions.

Method: A collaborative framework using three reasoning modules (Consultant, Programmer, Reviewer) for iterative problem-solving, debugging, and refinement.

Result: Improved bug-free code generation rates and decreased non-physical solutions, with enhanced execution success rates.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates that autonomous code generation and review mechanisms can serve as reliable paradigms for scientific computing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

### [20] [Single Agent Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Bus Fleet Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20784)
*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tackles bus bunching issues by presenting a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for bus holding control that outperforms traditional multi-agent RL approaches under realistic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bus bunching problem in urban transit, which arises due to traffic and passenger demand variability, the paper seeks to improve upon the limitations of multi-agent RL methods by introducing a more robust, scalable solution appropriate for heterogeneous and dynamic operational settings.

Method: A single-agent RL framework is introduced, which reformulates the multi-agent problem into a single-agent context by augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers like vehicle ID and station ID, along with numerical features. This allows the model to capture inter-agent dependencies using a high-dimensional encoding. A structured ridge-shaped reward function, designed to balance headway uniformity and schedule adherence, is also proposed.

Result: The proposed framework, utilizing a modified soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, demonstrated superior performance under stochastic conditions, outperforming benchmarks like MADDPG by significant margins (e.g., -430k vs. -530k). The model achieved more stable and effective bus holding management in complex, real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Single-agent deep RL enhanced with categorical structuring and customized rewards proves to be an effective, scalable solution for managing bus holding problems in non-loop, realistic transit systems, offering a promising alternative to traditional MARL systems.

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

### [21] [A Graph-Based Test-Harness for LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20810)
*Jessica Lundin,Guillaume Chabot-Couture*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new systematic benchmark for medical guideline evaluations using graph-based generation of dynamic questions focused on clinical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking medical guidelines is challenging due to the complexity and dynamic nature of clinical relationships, requiring scalable and comprehensive solutions.

Method: The authors converted WHO IMCI guidelines into a directed graph structure and generated questions with relevant age-based and contextual distractors to evaluate clinical tasks.

Result: Evaluation achieved 45-67% accuracy, where models were strong in symptom recognition but weak in triaging severity, treatment protocols, and follow-ups.

Conclusion: The graph-based dynamic methodology is scalable, contamination-resistant, and fills gaps in existing evaluations, optimizing both benchmarking and post-training for language models.

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

*Vipul Patel,Anirudh Deodhar,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper tackles the complex issue of workforce scheduling in healthcare facilities, proposing a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) to optimize cost, patient care quality, and staff satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare workforce scheduling involves balancing conflicting objectives like minimizing costs, ensuring adequate staffing to meet patient care needs, and preventing staff burnout.

Method: A Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) captures the complexity of scheduling by defining objective functions (cost, patient coverage, staff satisfaction) and generating non-dominated scheduling solutions.

Result: The algorithm demonstrated a 66% performance improvement over manual scheduling, based on tests using typical hospital unit datasets.

Conclusion: MOO-GA provides robust, balanced schedules and serves as a decision-support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators by efficiently handling healthcare scheduling challenges.

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

*Marianne Defresne,Romain Gambardella,Sophie Barbe,Thomas Schiex*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic architecture and probabilistic loss designed to learn solutions to NP-hard problems more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in combining discrete reasoning with neural networks, particularly in solving NP-hard optimization tasks from natural inputs, which is known to be difficult for large language models.

Method: The paper introduces a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture paired with a probabilistic loss function that learns both constraints and objectives. Training avoids embedding the combinatorial solver, enabling scalability and exact inference.

Result: Empirical tests show effective learning across Sudoku variants, visual Min-Cut/Max-Cut tasks, and protein design problems, with reduced training time and optimized performance.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture and loss function successfully tackle NP-hard problems, showing efficiency, scalability, and applicability to diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

TL;DR: ChatThero is a conversational AI system designed to aid substance use disorders (SUDs) recovery using cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing strategies. It demonstrates measurable improvements in therapy outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the global challenge of substance use disorders (SUDs) by overcoming stigma, motivational barriers, and limited support in current therapeutic solutions.

Method: ChatThero integrates dynamic patient modeling, therapeutic dialogues, and adaptive persuasion strategies based on CBT and MI. It employs a two-stage training pipeline using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO).

Result: ChatThero showed significant improvements in patient motivation (41.5%), a slight increase in treatment confidence (0.49%), and resolved complex cases more efficiently with 26% fewer conversational turns compared to GPT-4.

Conclusion: ChatThero enhances addiction recovery by leveraging clinically validated techniques within conversational AI frameworks, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving method for therapeutic interactions.

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

*Siyuan Lu,Kangwei Xu,Peng Xie,Rui Wang,Yuanqing Cheng*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in scalability of performance and power consumption of traditional CMOS-based FPGAs by leveraging Carbon Nanotube (CNT) technologies, proposing testing methods and architectures to overcome fabrication issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address scalability issues in performance and power for CMOS-based FPGAs, and mitigate process variations and defects stemming from immature fabrication processes in CNT-based devices.

Method: The authors propose a ring oscillator-based testing technique for detecting delay faults in MWCNT interconnects, carry chain testing in CLBs, a faster LUT testing circuit design, and a testing algorithm to detect m-CNTs alongside a redundant spare row sharing architecture for yield improvement.

Result: Experimental results indicate a 35.49% reduction in test time for 6-input LUTs, high fault detection algorithm coverage with minimal overhead, and effective repair of faulty segments using the redundant architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed testing techniques and redundant architecture significantly enhance efficiency, test coverage, and yield in CNT-based FPGAs, addressing process variation challenges and improving reliability.

Abstract: As the semiconductor manufacturing process technology node shrinks into the
nanometer-scale, the CMOS-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) face big
challenges in scalability of performance and power consumption. Multi-walled
Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) serves as a promising candidate for Cu interconnects
thanks to the superior conductivity. Moreover, Carbon Nanotube Field Transistor
(CNFET) also emerges as a prospective alternative to the conventional CMOS
device because of high power efficiency and large noise margin. The combination
of MWCNT and CNFET enables the promising CNT-based FPGAs. However, the MWCNT
interconnects exhibit significant process variations due to immature
fabrication process, leading to delay faults. Also, the non-ideal CNFET
fabrication process may generate a few metallic CNTs (m-CNTs), rendering
correlated faulty blocks. In this article, we propose a ring oscillator (RO)
based testing technique to detect delay faults due to the process variation of
MWCNT interconnects. Furthermore, we propose an effective testing technique for
the carry chains in CLBs, and an improved circuit design based on the lookup
table (LUT) is applied to speed up the fault testing of CNT-based FPGAs. In
addition, we propose a testing algorithm to detect m-CNTs in CLBs. Finally, we
propose a redundant spare row sharing architecture to improve the yield of
CNT-based FPGA further. Experimental results show that the test time for a
6-input LUT can be reduced by 35.49% compared with conventional testing, and
the proposed algorithm can achieve a high test coverage with little overhead.
The proposed redundant architecture can repair the faulty segment effectively
and efficiently.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shift from large shared memories to distributed private memory slices tightly coupled with compute elements, using advanced integration techniques to boost memory performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern system architectures face challenges due to memory latency, bandwidth, capacity, and energy constraints, necessitating innovative approaches for improving performance.

Method: The authors suggest breaking up memory into smaller slices closely coupled with compute nodes, leveraging 2.5D/3D integration for reduced distances and access costs, alongside explicit hardware management of data hierarchy by software.

Result: The proposed architecture improves bandwidth and energy-efficiency, optimizes data placement, and reduces memory-access complexity compared to traditional designs.

Conclusion: Memory system designs can benefit significantly by moving away from large shared architectures and adopting localized memory with closer integration to compute nodes, enhancing system scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Memory latency, bandwidth, capacity, and energy increasingly limit
performance. In this paper, we reconsider proposed system architectures that
consist of huge (many-terabyte to petabyte scale) memories shared among large
numbers of CPUs. We argue two practical engineering challenges, scaling and
signaling, limit such designs. We propose the opposite approach. Rather than
create large, shared, homogenous memories, systems explicitly break memory up
into smaller slices more tightly coupled with compute elements. Leveraging
advances in 2.5D/3D integration, this compute-memory node provisions private
local memory, enabling accesses of node-exclusive data through micrometer-scale
distances, and dramatically reduced access cost. In-package memory elements
support shared state within a processor, providing far better bandwidth and
energy-efficiency than DRAM, which is used as main memory for large working
sets and cold data. Hardware making memory capacities and distances explicit
allows software to efficiently compose this hierarchy, managing data placement
and movement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of efficiently accelerating SHA-3, a cryptographic operation with unique structural complexity, in modern CPU architectures.

Method: The authors developed and prototyped a custom SHA-3 instruction for RISC-V processors, utilizing GEM5 simulations and FPGA prototyping to evaluate performance and hardware impacts.

Result: Performance improvements of 8.02x for SHA-3 software workloads and 46.31x for Keccak-specific workloads were achieved, with a 15.09% increase in registers and 11.51% in LUT utilization.

Conclusion: The study highlights the feasibility and benefits of microarchitectural integration of SHA-3 acceleration, providing actionable insights for extending cryptographic instruction sets in CPUs.

Abstract: Integrating cryptographic accelerators into modern CPU architectures presents
unique microarchitectural challenges, particularly when extending instruction
sets with complex and multistage operations. Hardware-assisted cryptographic
instructions, such as Intel's AES-NI and ARM's custom instructions for
encryption workloads, have demonstrated substantial performance improvements.
However, efficient SHA-3 acceleration remains an open problem due to its
distinct permutation-based structure and memory access patterns. Existing
solutions primarily rely on standalone coprocessors or software optimizations,
often avoiding the complexities of direct microarchitectural integration. This
study investigates the architectural challenges of embedding a SHA-3
permutation operation as a custom instruction within a general-purpose
processor, focusing on pipelined simultaneous execution, storage utilization,
and hardware cost. In this paper, we investigated and prototyped a SHA-3 custom
instruction for the RISC-V CPU architecture. Using cycle-accurate GEM5
simulations and FPGA prototyping, our results demonstrate performance
improvements of up to 8.02x for RISC-V optimized SHA-3 software workloads and
up to 46.31x for Keccak-specific software workloads, with only a 15.09%
increase in registers and a 11.51% increase in LUT utilization. These findings
provide critical insights into the feasibility and impact of SHA-3 acceleration
at the microarchitectural level, highlighting practical design considerations
for future cryptographic instruction set extensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on bias evaluation and mitigation in multilingual and non-English contexts of NLP models.

Method: The researchers performed a systematic review of studies that explored bias in multilingual models, examining linguistic/cultural considerations and methodologies used.

Result: The study identified patterns such as a preference for specific languages, a lack of multilingual mitigation experiments, and issues in adapting cross-linguistic bias benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for research that is more inclusive, culturally appropriate, and in line with NLP advancements to better understand and address bias in multilingual models.

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models

### [29] [Prompting Strategies for Language Model-Based Item Generation in K-12 Education: Bridging the Gap Between Small and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20217)
*Mohammad Amini,Babak Ahmadi,Xiaomeng Xiong,Yilin Zhang,Christopher Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines using language models for automatic generation (AIG) of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessments, emphasizing structured prompting strategies and fine-tuning for improved performance in mid-sized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and inconsistency in manual test development for language assessments by leveraging the capabilities of language models.

Method: The researchers compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma) and an untuned large model (GPT-3.5), evaluated seven prompting strategies, and used automated metrics alongside expert scoring and GPT-4.1 to simulate human evaluation.

Result: Gemma's performance was enhanced through structured prompting, particularly chain-of-thought combined with sequential design. It outperformed GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses in creating construct-aligned MCQs, showing the importance of prompt design.

Conclusion: Structured prompting and fine-tuning can significantly improve mid-sized language models for educational AIG tasks, providing a scalable and practical workflow for generating high-quality language assessment items.

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing complexity in cyber-physical systems, especially automotive applications, necessitates better modeling and co-simulation methods.

Method: The authors propose encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co-Simulation FMUs and provide a lightweight toolchain for integration.

Result: The methodology effectively integrates SystemC TLM models with FMI workflows, resolving challenges like time synchronization and data exchange.

paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DGPO leverages teacher demonstrations and guidance to enable smaller language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) to achieve advanced agentic RAG capabilities, overcoming sparse rewards and unstable training in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges compact language models face—such as poor reasoning ability, sparse rewards, and instability—when trying to develop agentic RAG behaviors through reinforcement learning.

Method: Proposes Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which initializes models using teacher demonstrations and provides continuous teacher guidance throughout policy optimization. A new metric, Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), is also introduced for fine-grained evaluation.

Result: DGPO enables smaller language models to demonstrate sophisticated reasoning, search, and synthesis behaviors, with some even surpassing larger teacher models in performance.

Conclusion: DGPO effectively makes agentic RAG behaviors achievable for compact models in resource-constrained settings, highlighting its practical benefits.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [32] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)
*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD introduces an adaptive method to test compliance of LLMs with governmental ethics guidelines using actionable guideline-violating questions and jailbreak diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in translating high-level AI ethics guidelines into actionable, testable questions for assessing LLM compliance.

Method: GUARD generates guideline-violating questions automatically and employs jailbreak diagnostics for detecting potential lapses in adherence, producing a compliance report.

Result: Empirically evaluated GUARD on seven LLMs under three government-issued guidelines, validating its effectiveness in compliance testing and generalizing jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models.

Conclusion: GUARD is an effective tool for assessing and promoting adherence to ethical guidelines in LLMs and vision-language models.

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [33] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR enhances long-context understanding in LLMs by strategic text chunking, graph formation, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for better reasoning and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges like memory limitation, hallucinations, and ineffective handling of long contexts and complex reasoning tasks.

Method: JERR strategically extracts text synopsis, builds directed acyclic graphs to remove redundancies, and applies Monte Carlo Tree Search for reasoning.

Result: JERR achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on metrics like ROUGE, F1, and LLM-Rater evaluation.

Conclusion: JERR improves LLMs reliability, transparency, and ability to manage extended contexts and complex reasoning effectively.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

*Yuyao Wang,Bowen Liu,Jianheng Tang,Nuo Chen,Yuhan Li,Qifan Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces NP-hard graph problems as a synthetic training corpus for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), achieving improved performance in reasoning-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing Long CoT reasoning capabilities in LLMs currently relies on expensive, human-curated post-training datasets, prompting the need for scalable, alternative approaches.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage post-training framework using NP-hard graph problems: (i) supervised fine-tuning with rejection-sampled instances to enhance reasoning depth, and (ii) reinforcement learning with a specialized reward design to improve reasoning efficiency.

Result: The flagship model, Graph-R1-7B, achieves superior generalization in mathematics, coding, STEM, and logic tasks, and outperforms QwQ-32B in both accuracy and efficiency on NPH graph problems.

Conclusion: NP-hard graph problems emerge as an effective and scalable resource for improving Long CoT reasoning in LLMs, paving the way for more advanced and efficient post-training solutions.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available

### [35] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of conversational context on evaluating personality traits in Large Language Models (LLMs). It introduces a new framework called CAPE and provides metrics to assess consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current psychometric evaluations of LLMs ignore conversational context, using a context-free approach that doesn't reflect real-world interactions.

Method: The proposed CAPE framework evaluates LLM personality traits by incorporating conversational history and measuring response consistency and personality shifts.

Result: Experiments reveal context-dependent response consistency improvements, notable personality shifts in GPT models, and sensitivity variations across different LLMs.

Conclusion: The CAPE framework provides a more realistic personality evaluation for LLMs, highlighting the role of context in influencing behavior. Context-aware assessments align better with human judgments.

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [36] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how the utility of reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs) impacts final answer correctness, using conditional entropy to assess reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While intermediate reasoning is used to improve LLM accuracy, there is less focus on how reasoning steps directly affect answer correctness, especially given autoregressive generation's stochastic nature.

Method: The authors conduct an oracle study on the MATH dataset, utilizing models (Qwen2.5-32B, GPT-4o, Qwen3-8B) to analyze reasoning chains and measure utility through conditional entropy.

Result: Findings reveal that decreasing conditional entropy during reasoning correlates with correct answers, while stable or increasing entropy typically leads to errors. Additionally, incorrect reasoning paths are usually longer.

Conclusion: The study highlights that productive reasoning can be identified early through entropy patterns, paving the way for developing efficient reasoning pipelines to minimize distractions and errors.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DentalBench, a bilingual benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in the dental domain, encompassing a QA dataset and a large-scale corpus for domain adaptation, and shows its effectiveness through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The capability of medical large language models (LLMs) in specific domains like dentistry remains underexplored due to the lack of evaluation resources, which this paper aims to address.

Method: The paper develops DentalBench, comprising DentalQA (a bilingual QA benchmark with 36,597 questions across various dental topics) and DentalCorpus (a curated dental dataset with 337.35 million tokens for domain adaptation). It evaluates the performance of 14 LLMs and investigates domain adaptation techniques.

Result: The evaluation identifies performance gaps across tasks and languages and demonstrates that domain adaptation significantly improves model performance, especially in knowledge-intensive tasks, using Qwen-2.5-3B as a case study.

Conclusion: Domain-specific benchmarks are crucial for advancing trustworthy, effective LLMs in specialized fields like healthcare, highlighting the potential of targeted adaptations for dental applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-CQR is a novel retrieval framework in RAG that uses knowledge graphs to enhance query representations, leading to better retrieval performance in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve retrieval-augmented generation systems by addressing the contextual loss in complex input queries using knowledge graphs.

Method: Proposed KG-CQR framework that uses KG subgraph extraction, completion, and contextual generation to enrich query representation, operating as a model-agnostic pipeline without additional training.

Result: Experimental results show 4-6% mAP improvement and 2-3% Recall@25 improvement over baselines in RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG datasets.

Conclusion: KG-CQR effectively enriches query contexts using KGs, enhancing retrieval performance in complex tasks without requiring extensive model-specific training.

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

TL;DR: The paper introduces an industrial-grade benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) specifically tailored for civil aviation maintenance, addressing domain-specific deficiencies and enabling targeted improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors sought to address the absence of specialized evaluation methods for LLMs in the critical domain of civil aviation maintenance, focusing on tasks requiring advanced reasoning and domain knowledge.

Method: The paper develops a domain-specific benchmark to evaluate LLM capabilities in civil aviation maintenance, uses it to identify gaps in knowledge, and assesses existing vector embedding models and LLMs through experimental exploration.

Result: The benchmark effectively highlights specific limitations in the performance of LLMs and vector embedding models in civil aviation scenarios, demonstrating its utility as an evaluation tool.

Conclusion: The study successfully establishes and validates a robust framework for evaluating LLMs in the civil aviation maintenance domain, providing researchers and practitioners with open-source tools to drive further improvements in the field.

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Case Base Reasoning (CBR) system for finding practical work titles using TF-IDF for vectorization and Cosine Similarity for similarity measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system that efficiently suggests practical work titles based on previous cases with high similarity.

Method: The system applies TF-IDF for text vectorization of titles and employs Cosine Similarity to calculate similarity. It searches titles based on direct input or keywords.

Result: Tested on 705 practical work titles, five titles were checked in two stages. The results showed consistent output with similar match scores in randomized input tests.

Conclusion: The proposed CBR system effectively retrieves practical work titles with reliable similarity measurements using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing evaluation benchmarks for LLMs that fail to test their capabilities in realistic multi-step tasks requiring cross-tool coordination and reasoning.

Method: MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28 live MCP servers offering 250 tools across various domains, allowing for the construction of authentic multi-step tasks. A multi-faceted evaluation framework is also proposed to assess tool usage, planning, and completion skills.

Result: The experiments on 20 advanced LLMs show that existing models face significant challenges in completing the tasks designed in MCP-Bench.

Conclusion: MCP-Bench highlights areas where LLMs still exhibit limitations, particularly in tool retrieval, planning, and coordinating cross-domain workflows, offering an avenue for future model improvements.

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.
Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning framework integrating multimodal EHRs, including free-text data, for predicting mortality and resource utilization in ICU settings, demonstrating superior performance and robustness against data corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing patient outcomes and managing ICU costs requires accurate predictions, but prior approaches underutilize free-text notes and textual information in structured EHRs.

Method: The study utilizes natural language processing techniques and a transformer-based model trained on two EHR datasets for mortality prediction, length of stay (LOS) prediction, and surgical duration estimation, alongside ablation studies for key components.

Result: The proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods, improving various metrics across clinical tasks and demonstrating robustness against structured data corruption.

Conclusion: The framework integrates multimodal EHRs effectively, revealing the utility of prompt learning and transformer encoders, while maintaining resilience to high levels of data corruption.

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

*Luke Bates,Max Glockner,Preslav Nakov,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ConspirED dataset for analyzing conspiratorial thinking in online articles, explores cognitive traits using this data, and evaluates the susceptibility of AI to such content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks of conspiracy theories undermining public trust and the sophistication of AI-generated misinformation, and to build tools for better understanding and mitigation mechanisms.

Method: Development of ConspirED dataset annotated with cognitive traits of conspiratorial ideation, building computational models to identify such traits, and testing AI models' robustness against conspiratorial inputs.

Result: The analysis revealed that both computational and AI models mirror conspiratorial reasoning patterns, even when capable of addressing fact-checked misinformation.

Conclusion: Computational understanding of conspiratorial cognitive traits is essential as AI systems are vulnerable to reasoning patterns presented in conspiratorial content, necessitating further intervention tools and analysis.

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

TL;DR: The FLORES+ multilingual MT benchmark has significant shortcomings, including low translation quality and cultural bias, limiting its use for truly multilingual evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether the widely-used FLORES+ benchmark is suitable for evaluating modern machine translation systems across diverse languages.

Method: The paper analyzes translations in four specific languages, conducts human assessments, and tests evaluation protocol vulnerabilities using heuristics like named entity copying.

Result: The analysis reveals low translation quality in FLORES+, cultural biases in source texts, and unreliable BLEU score evaluations. Models trained on naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ but excel on a domain-relevant dataset.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for multilingual benchmarks with culturally neutral, domain-general texts and improved evaluation protocols to address real-world translation challenges.

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

*Pengjiang Li,Zaitian Wang,Xinhao Zhang,Ran Zhang,Lu Jiang,Pengfei Wang,Yuanchun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciTopic is an advanced topic discovery method leveraging large language models (LLMs) for better scientific literature analysis, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in capturing semantic and high-dimensional text relationships in scientific publications using traditional topic discovery methods.

Method: The method involves using a textual encoder for metadata, title, and abstract; a space optimization module with entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks; and fine-tuning through contrastive loss optimization guided by LLMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrated SciTopic's superior performance over SOTA methods in scientific topic discovery.

Conclusion: SciTopic improves the understanding and identification of scientific topics, providing deeper and faster insights for researchers.

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

### [49] [Adaptive Federated Distillation for Multi-Domain Non-IID Textual Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20557)
*Jiahao Xiao,Jiangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies challenges of non-IID data in federated learning for NLP and introduces an Adaptive Federated Distillation framework to improve performance in multi-domain non-IID scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue that local client data in federated learning do not represent global data distributions well, particularly in NLP applications where prior work mainly focused on label diversity rather than language domain diversity.

Method: The authors propose a benchmarking framework that includes multi-domain non-IID scenarios for federated learning and introduce an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework suitable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings.

Result: The proposed model effectively captures the diversity of local clients and outperforms existing methods in multi-domain non-IID federated learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical solution and benchmark for addressing multi-domain non-IID challenges in federated learning for NLP, contributing valuable insights to the field.

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework leveraging generative models for Query-Driven Text Summarization (QDTS) in web search, achieving better performance and efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the identified limitations in extractive summarization models, such as cumulative information loss and insufficient semantic understanding for complex search intents.

Method: The approach incorporates model distillation, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to optimize a lightweight 0.1B parameter model for QDTS.

Result: The proposed model surpasses the production baseline in industry metrics, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and shows high deployment efficiency, processing ~50,000 queries per second using 334 GPUs.

Conclusion: Generative models can effectively improve real-time QDTS in industrial web search, providing both superior summarization quality and operational efficiency.

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

*Yangfan Wang,Jie Liu,Chen Tang,Lian Yan,Jingchi Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS) to improve the diversity and accuracy of multi-hop question generation by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-hop question answering is hampered by data sparsity, leading to language models learning spurious patterns. Existing solutions overlook integrating essential knowledge such as relevant sentences.

Method: The paper proposes a framework, KCS, modeling knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level prediction task with probabilistic contrastive loss and using stochastic decoding for accuracy and diversity.

Result: KCS improves knowledge composition selection accuracy by 3.9% and enhances performance on the HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets through data augmentation.

Conclusion: The KCS framework effectively diversifies multi-hop question generation and boosts question-answering dataset performance by improving knowledge integration techniques.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights issues in current evaluation methods for Graph-Language Models (GLMs) and introduces a new benchmark, CLEGR, to assess multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for GLMs are inadequate for evaluating their capability to integrate graph structure and language semantics for multimodal reasoning.

Method: The authors developed the CLEGR benchmark with a synthetic graph generation pipeline and compositional questions to test GLM's joint reasoning over graph structure and textual semantics.

Result: Their evaluation showed soft-prompted LLMs performing similarly to GLMs with GNN structures, questioning the necessity of graph integration in GLMs. They also noted poor GLM performance on structural reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the limitations of current GLMs in multimodal reasoning and aims to push the development of improved models in this domain.

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

TL;DR: End-to-end ASR systems struggle with domain-specific named entities, and existing correction methods fail in significant word form discrepancies. A novel NEC method utilizing speech sound features improves entity accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in ASR systems failing to transcribe domain-specific named entities, which impact downstream tasks negatively.

Method: Develop a NEC model that uses speech sound features for candidate retrieval and an innovative generative approach to replace erroneous entities in transcripts.

Result: The proposed model showed significant improvement in entity accuracy during tests on open-source and self-constructed datasets.

Conclusion: The new NEC method enhances transcription quality in ASR systems, especially for domain-specific entities, and will have open-access test sets and training data.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a specialized model for multi-lingual, multi-label implicit discourse relation recognition using hierarchical discourse sense dependencies.

Method: The authors developed HArch, which utilizes hierarchical dependencies in discourse senses, tested across different encoder backbones and compared in performance against few-shot LLM prompting models.

Result: RoBERTa-HArch achieved the best results in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch excelled in a multi-lingual context. Fine-tuned models outperformed LLMs like GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick.

Conclusion: HArch demonstrates the strength of task-specific fine-tuning for IDRR, delivering SOTA performance on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus and excelling across language configurations.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

TL;DR: The paper addresses tokenization inconsistencies (TI) in text-based steganography and watermarking, proposing methods to improve robustness, imperceptibility, and detectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle vulnerabilities in steganography and watermarking caused by TI, which impede robustness and reliability.

Method: Developed a stepwise verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for watermarking.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the improvements in fluency, imperceptibility, anti-steganalysis capacity in steganography, as well as detectability and robustness in watermarking.

Conclusion: Directly addressing tokenization inconsistency results in more robust and reliable text-based steganography and watermarking systems.

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a highly efficient model capable of advanced reasoning and problem-solving in mathematical tasks while using minimal computational resources.

Method: Implemented three key innovations: (i) efficient RL infrastructure with a Python code environment; (ii) GRPO-RoC, an RL algorithm addressing noise in coding tool use; (iii) a multi-stage agent training recipe starting from non-reasoning SFT and progressing to reinforcement learning.

Result: The model achieved state-of-the-art performance in mathematical reasoning tasks (AIME24 and AIME25) with significant compute efficiency, outperforming a 671B model in accuracy.

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent demonstrates the feasibility of scaling agentic RL, achieving frontier-level reasoning capabilities with less computational cost. Its success opens doors to broader applications in alignment and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

### [57] [Leveraging Semantic Triples for Private Document Generation with Local Differential Privacy Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20736)
*Stephen Meisenbacher,Maulik Chevli,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DP-ST, a method using semantic triples combined with LLM post-processing for coherent text generation under local differential privacy (DP), achieving balanced privacy and utility even at lower ε values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting sensitive text via differential privacy in natural language processing is challenging due to stringent indistinguishability requirements under local DP, which often necessitate high ε values for meaningful results.

Method: The authors propose DP-ST, a divide-and-conquer approach that uses semantic triples to generate private documents within a constrained neighborhood, followed by LLM-based post-processing for coherent text generation.

Result: DP-ST is effective in generating balanced outputs, achieving coherence in text privatization even with lower ε values while maintaining local DP guarantees.

Conclusion: The study underscores the significance of coherence in creating practical DP-enabled text transformations, showing that neighborhood-aware generation and LLM integration can mitigate the high ε requirement.

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

*Vassiliy Cheremetiev,Quang Long Ho Ngo,Chau Ying Kot,Alina Elena Baia,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates state-of-the-art detection of implicit hate speech (IHS) using fine-tuning of general-purpose language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting implicit hate speech is challenging due to its subtle and indirect nature, requiring innovative approaches for accurate identification.

Method: Fine-tuning recent large language models (LLMs) like Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed, and E5, without incorporating external data or additional specific context.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in detecting IHS, with up to 1.10 percentage points improvement in in-dataset tests and 20.35 percentage points improvement in cross-dataset evaluations (F1-macro score).

Conclusion: Fine-tuned general-purpose embedding models provide effective detection of IHS, outperforming traditional task-specific approaches and demonstrating high adaptability across datasets.

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

*Yuanhao Ding,Esteban Garces Arias,Meimingwei Li,Julian Rodemann,Matthias Aßenmacher,Danlu Chen,Gaojuan Fan,Christian Heumann,Chongsheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GUARD, a text generation decoding method to enhance coherence and diversity, overcoming limitations like hyperparameter reliance and high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing coherence and diversity in large language model (LLM) text generation is difficult, and existing methods like contrastive search face challenges with hyperparameter reliance and computational inefficiency.

Method: GUARD employs a 'Glocal' uncertainty-driven approach combining global entropy estimates with local entropy deviations to integrate long- and short-term uncertainty signals. It also includes a token-count-based penalty to lower computational costs.

Result: Experimental results highlight GUARD's superior ability to balance text coherence and diversity while achieving faster generation speeds. Both human and LLM evaluations validate its exceptional performance.

Conclusion: GUARD proves to be a reliable and efficient decoding method for open-ended text generation, achieving coherence-diversity balance without significant computational sacrifices.

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

*Xiaoyi Wang,Jiwei Zhang,Guangtao Zhang,Honglei Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the emotional dynamics of therapy dialogues generated by LLMs compared to real therapy, finding significant differences in emotional variability and authenticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the unclear emotional fidelity of synthetic therapy dialogues generated by LLMs when compared to real-world therapy conversations.

Method: The researchers conduct a comparative analysis of emotional arcs using the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework across valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions in both real and synthetic therapy conversations.

Result: The study finds that synthetic dialogues show less emotional variability and authenticity than real therapy sessions. Emotional arc similarity is particularly low for clients.

Conclusion: LLM-generated therapy data currently lacks emotional fidelity, underscoring the need for improved emotional realism in mental health applications. A new dataset, RealCBT, is introduced for advancing research in this area.

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

*Harethah Abu Shairah,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,George Turkiyyah,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Rank-One Safety Injection" (ROSI), a low-cost method to enhance safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) by steering activation pathways without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address vulnerabilities in LLM safety mechanisms, which can be bypassed by manipulating model representations.

Method: ROSI modifies all residual stream write matrices with rank-one weight updates, steering activations toward refusal-mediating subspaces. The safety direction is derived using harmful and harmless instruction pairs.

Result: ROSI enhances refusal rates for unsafe requests while maintaining high performance on standard benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag, and Arc. It also proves effective for re-aligning uncensored models by amplifying latent safety features.

Conclusion: The proposed method is an efficient, interpretable, and complementary solution to existing fine-tuning approaches for improving LLM safety alignment.

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores automated identification of cognitive distortions in Dutch adolescent forum posts, highlighting challenges in cross-lingual and cross-register generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address rising mental health issues among youth by detecting cognitive distortions in digital text for potential early interventions.

Method: The study focuses on analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents and evaluates the impact of language and writing style changes on model performance, using domain adaptation methods.

Result: The findings reveal that language and writing style changes significantly influence model effectiveness, with domain adaptation emerging as a promising solution.

Conclusion: Detecting cognitive distortions in diverse contexts is achievable, but adaptation methods are crucial for overcoming language and style variations.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

*Jie Zhao,Wanting Ning,Yuxiao Fei,Yubo Feng,Lishuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GDLLM, a method combining graph structures and temporal learning using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve Event Temporal Relation Extraction (ETRE), especially for minority classes, and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of Small Language Models (SLMs) in handling minority class relations due to restricted pre-trained knowledge and the potential noise introduced by manually designed prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: The authors propose GDLLM, which integrates a distance-aware graph structure employing Graph Attention Network (GAT) for long-distance dependencies and a temporal feature learning paradigm based on soft inference for enhancing short-distance relation identification.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves performance on minority relation classes and overall learning ability, achieving state-of-the-art results on the TB-Dense and MATRES datasets.

Conclusion: GDLLM enhances the capability of LLMs for Event Temporal Relation Extraction by effectively capturing global features and improving model performance, particularly for imbalanced classification datasets.

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Rohan Phanse,Yijie Zhou,Kejian Shi,Wencai Zhang,Yixin Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces two new benchmarks, MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, aimed at evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for multi-source retrieval and long-form generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for RAG systems to handle cases where information must be synthesized from multiple sources, which is a common real-world scenario.

Method: Developed a scalable evaluation framework and created two benchmarks, MSRS-Story (narrative synthesis) and MSRS-Meet (summarization), testing various RAG pipelines with different retrievers and LLMs.

Result: Findings indicate that generation quality relies heavily on retrieval effectiveness, with reasoning models showing superiority over standard LLMs in multi-source synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: Multi-source synthesis presents significant challenges for RAG systems, requiring both effective retrieval and synthesis capabilities. The proposed benchmarks can drive advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

### [66] [The Uneven Impact of Post-Training Quantization in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20893)
*Benjamin Marie,Atsushi Fujita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation tasks across 55 languages using five large language models (LLMs) ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. It identifies the challenges of 4-bit and 2-bit quantization for low-resource and diverse languages, evaluates four quantization techniques, and concludes with recommendations for deploying PTQ in multilingual scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to deploy large language models on resource-limited hardware highlights the importance of quantization techniques. However, the impact of these techniques on multilingual tasks, particularly in low-resource settings, has not been sufficiently studied.

Method: The study evaluates post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation tasks across 55 languages using five LLMs (1.7B–70B parameters). It examines the effects of 4-bit and 2-bit quantization, compares four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), and investigates the interactions between quantization, decoding hyperparameters, and calibration languages.

Result: The research shows that 4-bit quantization largely maintains translation quality for high-resource languages but leads to performance degradation for low-resource and diverse languages, especially in 2-bit settings. GGUF was the most robust technique, and language-matched calibration offered benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights about deploying multilingual LLMs under quantization constraints. It highlights considerations for model size, algorithm choice, and calibration language to improve performance, particularly in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SageLM, a novel system for evaluating Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models by integrating semantic and acoustic dimensions for better explainability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation of Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models remains a challenge, as current methods often neglect acoustic features and lack explainability.

Method: SageLM employs rationale-based supervision for improved explainability, integrates both semantic and acoustic evaluation dimensions, and uses the synthetic SpeechFeedback dataset alongside a two-stage training paradigm.

Result: SageLM achieves an 82.79% agreement rate with human evaluators, surpassing cascaded methods and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42% and 26.20%.

Conclusion: SageLM offers a comprehensive and explainable approach for Speech-to-Speech LLM evaluation, demonstrating superior alignment with human evaluators compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of consistent reasoning, policy adherence, and long-term information extraction by LLM-based agents in dynamic environments.

Method: The study involves manual error analysis, experimenting with input reformulations, and proposing the IRMA framework for structured input reformulation.

Result: IRMA outperforms methods like ReAct, Function Calling, and Self-Reflection by significant margins in a multi-turn conversational benchmark.

Conclusion: IRMA improves the reliability and decision-making consistency of tool-using agents, demonstrating its advantage in dynamic conversational environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: In-Context Learning depends heavily on exemplar quality. This research introduces a two-stage selection strategy combining semantic relevance, structural alignment, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing In-Context Learning approaches for semantic parsing struggle with structural alignment leading to poor performance and generalization.

Method: Fine-tune BERT-based retriever for structure-aware supervision and enrich its hidden representations with a model-agnostic plug-in module.

Result: Consistently better performance compared to current baselines across four semantic parsing benchmarks using multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: Structural alignment and enhanced exemplar selection play a critical role in optimizing semantic parsing tasks for In-Context Learning.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs focus narrowly on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, hindering comprehensive exploration of proactive dialogue capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces ProactiveEval, which establishes evaluation metrics for proactive dialogue and automatically generates diverse evaluation environments across various domains.

Result: 328 evaluation environments were developed in 6 domains, and experiments on 22 LLMs revealed DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet excel at different aspects of proactive dialogue.

Conclusion: ProactiveEval provides a standardized evaluation framework for proactive dialogue, with findings offering insights into reasoning and proactive behaviors in LLMs for future development.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LETHE, a comprehensive method to neutralize backdoor attacks in large language models (LLMs) through internal knowledge dilution and external distraction mechanisms. LETHE outperforms existing defenses by reducing attack success rates by up to 98%, while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of large language models to sophisticated backdoor attacks, which current defenses fail to comprehensively mitigate.

Method: LETHE neutralizes backdoors via internal knowledge dilution using a clean auxiliary model merged with the backdoored model, and external distractions by incorporating benign evidence into prompts.

Result: In experiments with 5 LLMs and 8 backdoor attacks, LETHE reduced backdoor success rates by up to 98% while maintaining typical model functionality.

Conclusion: LETHE represents a cost-efficient and robust solution to mitigate advanced backdoor attacks in LLMs, surpassing state-of-the-art defense techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

### [73] [Re-Representation in Sentential Relation Extraction with Sequence Routing Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21049)
*Ramazan Ali Bahrami,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces dynamic routing in capsules for improving sentential relation extraction (RE), achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets, and discussing challenges like label noise and re-representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing sentential relation extraction techniques by leveraging insights from neuroscience and improving representation learning.

Method: Utilizes dynamic routing in capsule networks to perform sentential relation extraction, analyzing performance on various datasets.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing methods on datasets like Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, and Conll04 but struggles on noisy datasets like Wikidata.

Conclusion: Noise in labeling and challenges related to re-representation affect performance in RE, highlighting the importance of refining approaches for distant supervision tasks.

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

### [74] [Enabling Equitable Access to Trustworthy Financial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21051)
*William Jurayj,Nils Holzenberger,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic system combining large language models (LLMs) and symbolic solvers to tackle tax filing tasks, evaluated using the SARA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tax filing is complex and error-prone, leading to high costs and penalties for mistakes. This paper addresses the need for an efficient, accurate, and cost-effective automated tax assistance system.

Method: The authors develop a system combining LLMs with symbolic reasoning and evaluate its performance on the SARA dataset. Techniques include translating rules into formal logic and retrieving case-specific exemplars to enhance accuracy.

Result: The integrated system significantly reduces tax filing costs and outperforms baseline methods on accuracy and reliability for statutory reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic architectures are practical and economically viable for improving equitable access to reliable, automated tax assistance systems.

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

### [75] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181)
*Alberto Compagnoni,Davide Caffagni,Nicholas Moratelli,Lorenzo Baraldi,Marcella Cornia,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CHAIR-DPO, a method to reduce hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using the CHAIR metric and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the persistent issue of MLLMs generating hallucinated content, which hampers their reliability in visually-informed tasks.

Method: The approach leverages the CHAIR metric to evaluate hallucination tendencies in generated answers and uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune existing MLLMs, reducing hallucinations without requiring complex pipelines.

Result: CHAIR-DPO significantly reduced hallucinations in multiple hallucination benchmarks, highlighting the potential of a CHAIR-based reward in fine-tuning MLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed CHAIR-DPO approach successfully aligns MLLMs to mitigate hallucination issues, presenting a simpler and effective alternative for improving their performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [76] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates the capabilities of Stable Diffusion (SD) for accurate and efficient image forgery localization, achieving up to a 12% performance improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the rapid advancements in image manipulation technologies powered by models like Stable Diffusion, which pose challenges for existing forensic methods that rely on costly annotated data and cannot keep up with new manipulation techniques.

Method: The authors use the multi-modal architecture of Stable Diffusion V3 (SD3), conditioning it on forgery-related information. Image forgery residuals, extracted using highpass filters, are treated as an explicit modality and fused into the latent space during training to preserve rich semantic information while enhancing forgery localization.

Result: The proposed framework achieves up to a 12% improvement in performance on standard benchmarking datasets compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. It also generalizes well to unseen real-world document and natural scene forgery tasks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that leveraging the multi-modal and perceptual capabilities of Stable Diffusion can offer significant advancements in image forgery localization, addressing the limitations of current methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

*Max Torop,Masih Eskandar,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jinyang Liu,Jochen Weber,Octavia Camps,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy,Kivanc Kose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing interpretability in AI skin disease diagnostics by combining Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attributes, improving reasoning and predictive accuracy via grounded embedding spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models are effective in diagnosing skin diseases but lack adequate interpretability to support practical clinical use. There is a need to improve how AI predictions are explained to enhance trust and usability.

Method: The authors combine MLLMs, capable of providing natural language reasoning, with predictive quantitative attributes related to lesion appearances. They fine-tune MLLM embedding spaces to predict these attributes from images.

Result: The study shows that MLLM embedding spaces can be grounded in quantitative attributes, with fine-tuning improving interpretability. Results are illustrated with attribute-specific image retrieval experiments on the SLICE-3D dataset.

Conclusion: Grounding AI predictions in quantitative attributes via MLLM embedding spaces enhances interpretability. These enhancements hold promise for integrating AI into practical clinical applications for skin disease analysis.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework for automatic modulation recognition (AMR) that performs effectively even with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for AMR require large labeled datasets or complex training pipelines, limiting their scalability and adaptability. This paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The approach combines a ViT encoder, lightweight convolutional decoder, and linear classifier, employing supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and reconstruction objectives.

Result: The model achieves higher accuracy on the RML2018.01A dataset compared to baseline approaches, including CNN and ViT, even with 15-20% labeled data. It also performs well across varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is label-efficient, generalizable, and provides robust performance for AMR tasks, addressing the scalability and adaptability issues of previous solutions.

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [79] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman is a framework designed for generating high-resolution and long-duration audio-driven human animation videos, addressing challenges like identity drift and hand motion distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is high demand for audio-driven human animation videos in practical applications, but current methods suffer from challenges such as error accumulation causing identity/color drift and instability, as well as poorly modeled hand motions.

Method: InfinityHuman uses a coarse-to-fine framework, employing an audio-synchronized pose generation followed by a pose-guided refiner. This refiner anchors visual consistency and employs a hand-specific reward mechanism to enhance accuracy.

Result: Experiments on EMTD and HDTF datasets indicate InfinityHuman surpasses existing methods in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip synchronization.

Conclusion: InfinityHuman effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, establishing state-of-the-art performance, particularly in appearance consistency and hand gesture realism, making it viable for practical applications.

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper advances saliency prediction in 360-degree videos by introducing two innovative models, SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV, and presenting a specialized dataset, YT360-EyeTracking, highlighting the importance of spatial audio in viewer attention prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets and effective models for saliency prediction in 360-degree audio-visual environments, enabling better understanding of how audio-visual cues impact viewer attention in omnidirectional videos.

Method: The study curates a new dataset called YT360-EyeTracking with 81 omnidirectional videos observed under varied audio-visual conditions. It introduces two models: SalViT360, which utilizes a vision-transformer framework with spherical geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and an enhanced variation, SalViT360-AV, which integrates audio-conditioned transformer adapters.

Result: The proposed models, SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV, demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, including the newly introduced YT360-EyeTracking.

Conclusion: The integration of spatial audio cues into saliency prediction models is essential for accurate attention prediction in omnidirectional videos, offering significant advancements in audio-visual environment analysis.

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline leveraging Vision-Language Models to enhance the explainability of vision models at both individual sample and dataset levels, addressing a gap in current xAI methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models emphasize performance metrics but lack focus on explainability, which is crucial for understanding general behaviors and preventing biases.

Method: The proposed pipeline combines Vision-Language Models and xAI techniques to provide explanations for both sample-specific and dataset-level analyses.

Result: The pipeline aids in discovering failure cases and provides insights into the trends and patterns of vision models with minimal effort.

Conclusion: Integrating vision model development with xAI analysis through this pipeline offers a valuable approach to advancing image analysis and improving model transparency.

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing efficient models for agricultural computer vision tasks under resource constraints.

Method: Combines adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to distill knowledge from MobileNetV3 Large to smaller residual CNN models.

Result: Achieved validation accuracy over 96.7% across all student models, outperforming established methods by 1.6%, with low inference latency.

Conclusion: ATMS-KD effectively transfers knowledge to lightweight models, making them suitable for agricultural environments while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid vision-language representation (VLR) framework for material qualification, integrating deep learning models like CLIP and FLAVA to better align microstructural data and textual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the bottleneck in qualifying advanced materials in industrial manufacturing, particularly for non-conventional additive manufacturing, by connecting microstructural informatics with expert knowledge.

Method: The framework integrates deep semantic segmentation with pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA) and develops a customized similarity-based representation for zero-shot classification of microstructures.

Result: The method successfully distinguishes acceptable and defective samples in metal matrix composite datasets, with FLAVA showing better visual sensitivity and CLIP aligning consistently with textual criteria.

Conclusion: The work advances qualification pipelines by ensuring semantic interoperability and enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making, improving traceability without the need for retraining task-specific models.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Shultz,David K. Wright,Dexiao Kong,Sharon L. Naismith,Terence J. O'Brien,Ying Xia,Meng Law,Benjamin Sinclair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an evaluation of the MedNeXt-L-k5 model for automating the segmentation of perivascular spaces (PVS) in the brain, achieving efficient but varying performance across T2-weighted and T1-weighted MRI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of manual segmentation and current automated deep learning models for PVS, which are time-intensive, prone to moderate inter-rater reliability, and lack generalizability across diverse MRI datasets.

Method: The authors adapted the MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network, for PVS segmentation and trained it on homogeneous T2-weighted MRI datasets (Human Connectome Project-Aging) and heterogeneous T1-weighted MRI datasets from various studies.

Result: The model achieved the highest voxel-level Dice scores (0.88±0.06) for T2-weighted MRI images but showed substantially lower performance for T1-weighted images and under leave-one-site-out cross-validation (LOSOCV).

Conclusion: While MedNeXt-L-k5 offers an efficient solution for PVS segmentation, its performance does not surpass nnU-Net, highlighting that Transformer-inspired attention mechanisms may not be crucial for improving PVS segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses CLIP's limitations in open-vocabulary segmentation by introducing a training-free framework that adapts patch-level outputs back into intermediate attention. It improves spatial and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with poor spatial localization and limited interaction between intermediate attention and text representations in open-vocabulary segmentation tasks.

Method: The authors propose a self-adaptive framework that uses output predictions to guide intermediate attention adjustments. Key modules include attention isolation, confidence-based pruning, and adaptation ensemble.

Result: The proposed method integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art models and backbones, consistently improving performance across eight benchmarks.

Conclusion: Feedback-driven adaptation ensures better spatial coherence and semantic alignment, enhancing CLIP's segmentation capabilities without the need for re-training or major modifications.

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a probing framework to analyze how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual and textual inputs across layers, revealing stage-wise processing dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the internal processing dynamics of MLLMs to improve comprehension of their multimodal representation capabilities and guiding future developments.

Method: The framework trains linear classifiers on token embeddings across layers to predict fine-grained visual categories, using controlled prompt variations across lexical, semantic, and output format changes.

Result: MLLMs exhibit a consistent stage-wise structure: early layers focus on visual grounding, middle layers handle reasoning, and final layers prepare outputs. Layer-specific roles shift depending on the base LLM architecture.

Conclusion: MLLMs show stable stage-wise structures across variations, offering insights into multimodal representation dynamics and providing a lightweight analytical approach.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

### [87] [Disentangling Latent Embeddings with Sparse Linear Concept Subspaces (SLiCS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20322)
*Zhi Li,Hau Phan,Matthew Emigh,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SLiCS, a supervised method to disentangle complex scene embeddings into concept-specific subspaces for tasks like image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide valuable semantic embedding spaces but lack disentanglement for complex scene analysis.

Method: The method involves supervised dictionary learning, optimizing a sparse linear synthesis model using group-structured dictionaries and alternating optimization techniques.

Result: SLiCS achieves improved precision in concept-filtered image retrieval across embeddings from CLIP, TiTok, and DINOv2 models.

Conclusion: Disentangled embeddings enhance downstream tasks by providing semantic clarity for tasks like image retrieval and text-based interpretations.

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have transformative potential but introduce serious security concerns. MedFoundationHub provides a secure GUI toolkit for physicians and engineers to deploy these models with privacy-preserving features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy and security risks posed by medical VLMs, while enabling their clinical utility, accessibility, and safe deployment.

Method: Developed MedFoundationHub, a GUI toolkit for secure and efficient deployment of medical VLMs on offline local workstations, using Docker orchestration and open-source integration.

Result: Clinicians evaluated five state-of-the-art VLMs using the toolkit, revealing recurring shortcomings like off-target answers, vague reasoning, and inconsistent terminology across 1015 scoring events.

Conclusion: While MedFoundationHub enhances deployment security, current medical VLMs still demonstrate limitations in understanding and reasoning in pathology-based applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

*Mang Cao,Sanping Zhou,Yizhe Li,Ye Deng,Wenli Huang,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BIM, a method for multi-task dense prediction using novel scanning mechanisms to balance efficiency and performance, outperforming competitors in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between interaction completeness and computational efficiency in existing multi-task dense prediction methods.

Method: The authors propose BIM with Bidirectional Interaction Scan (BI-Scan) and Multi-Scale Scan (MS-Scan) mechanisms. BI-Scan uses task-first and position-first scanning for efficient cross-task interaction. MS-Scan achieves multi-granularity scene modeling.

Result: BIM demonstrated superior performance against state-of-the-art methods on challenging benchmarks like NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context.

Conclusion: The BIM framework successfully improves computational efficiency and cross-task interaction in multi-task dense prediction, meeting diverse requirements and advancing state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

*Hyeonyu Kim,Seokhoon Jeong,Seonghee Han,Chanhyuk Choi,Taehwan Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an audio-guided visual editing framework capable of handling complex tasks, integrating audio and text prompts without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual editing methods relying on textual prompts struggle with complex scenarios where non-text guidance like audio is required. Current audio-guided methods lack generalization due to reliance on specific training datasets.

Method: The proposed method uses a pre-trained multimodal encoder with zero-shot capabilities to integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks. It addresses discrepancies between audio encoder space and diffusion model's prompt encoder space and employs innovative techniques like separate noise branching and adaptive patch selection.

Result: Experiments show the framework effectively handles complicated visual editing tasks by leveraging rich audio information, outperforming text-only approaches.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential to significantly enhance visual editing capabilities by incorporating both audio and text prompts without the need for additional training.

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

*Luong Tran,Thieu Vo,Anh Nguyen,Sang Dinh,Van Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of multi-label image classification with partially annotated datasets by introducing the GPR Loss function and DAMP technique within the AEVLP framework, leading to improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully annotating large-scale datasets for multi-label learning is expensive and impractical, necessitating methods that can work with partially annotated data, such as Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML).

Method: The authors propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss) for handling noise in pseudo-labels and the Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) strategy for more robust label generation. These approaches are integrated into the AEVLP framework.

Result: The proposed AEVLP framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in multi-label classification, as demonstrated through experiments on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods and framework address the limitations of existing SPML methods, improving accuracy and minimizing false negatives and noise, establishing a new standard for multi-label learning with partially annotated data.

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a delay-spike approach and a novel temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron for improved performance in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), particularly for visual detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in ultra-low latency settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While ANN-SNN conversion methods perform well in classification tasks with low time-steps, their performance in visual detection tasks was suboptimal, necessitating better approaches to overcome this limitation.

Method: The authors developed a delay-spike approach to address heterogeneous spiking patterns and introduced a temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture. The tdIF neuron dynamically adjusts its behavior based on time-step order to enhance temporal spike properties without raising energy consumption.

Result: Their method demonstrated precise feature representation with lower time-steps. It achieved high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection tasks, showing superior results in both object and lane line detection compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed delay-spike and tdIF neuron innovations achieve superior accuracy and latency for visual detection tasks, setting a new standard in ANN-SNN conversion methods while maintaining energy efficiency.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DUP-MCRNet, a novel network for salient object detection (SOD) that addresses issues like detail loss and insufficient multi-modal fusion in complex scenes. It effectively improves edge clarity and background robustness, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOD methods struggle with detail loss, edge blurring, and poor multi-modal information fusion in complex scenes, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: The paper proposes DUP-MCRNet, which includes: (1) a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module for better edge and small structure detection, (2) a multi-modal collaborative fusion strategy to combine RGB, depth, and edge features dynamically, and (3) multi-scale optimization with novel loss and supervision mechanisms.

Result: DUP-MCRNet demonstrates improved performance in detecting salient objects across common benchmark datasets, especially excelling in edge clarity and robustness against complex backgrounds.

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet effectively addresses limitations in existing SOD models by leveraging dynamic uncertainty propagation and multi-modal reasoning, setting a new benchmark standard for salient object detection in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

*Taiga Yamane,Satoshi Suzuki,Ryo Masumura,Shota Orihashi,Tomohiro Tanaka,Mana Ihori,Naoki Makishima,Naotaka Kawata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel pedestrian detection method using multi-view images, addressing challenges of scale variation by introducing the Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD) technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for multi-view pedestrian detection struggle to handle small or large pedestrian scales or scale disparity between views due to underutilized multi-scale image features.

Method: The proposed MSMVD method extracts multi-scale image features for individual views, projects them into BEV space for scale-specific features, and processes these via a feature pyramid network to aggregate multi-view and multi-scale information.

Result: MSMVD significantly improves pedestrian detection performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 4.5 MODA points on the GMVD dataset.

Conclusion: Exploiting multi-scale features in multi-view settings enhances detection precision and robustness, especially in challenging scale-variance scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

TL;DR: This paper presents SFMFNet, a lightweight and effective network for real-time deepfake detection, balancing accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detectors often have high accuracy but are computationally expensive, making them impractical for real-time usage.

Method: SFMFNet integrates a spatial-frequency hybrid module, token-selective cross attention, and a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure to improve detection of subtle manipulations efficiently.

Result: SFMFNet achieves strong performance on various benchmarks, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time scenarios.

Conclusion: SFMFNet is a practical, efficient solution for real-time deepfake detection, offering both strong generalization and performance.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a medical image classification method combining dual-model weight selection and self-knowledge distillation to create lightweight models with comparable performance to large-scale ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large-scale models for medical image classification are resource-intensive, making lightweight solutions necessary for practical use.

Method: Two lightweight models initialized with weights of a pretrained large-scale model are processed via self-knowledge distillation, followed by fine-tuning for specific classification tasks.

Result: Experiments on datasets of chest X-ray, lung CT, and brain MRI images show superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively transfers knowledge to lightweight models, resolving issues of compact models retaining critical information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to compress LiDAR point clouds more efficiently, involving a Geometry Re-Densification Module and a Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of high storage and transmission overhead in high-precision LiDAR point cloud scans, which is exacerbated by the extreme sparsity of geometric details, resulting in inefficient context modeling and limited compression efficiency.

Method: The authors introduce two lightweight modules: (1) the Geometry Re-Densification Module re-densifies sparse geometry, processes it for feature extraction, and re-sparsifies it for predictive coding to avoid costly calculations; (2) the Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module uses occupancy cues from different resolution levels to propagate hierarchical features, enabling information sharing and reducing redundancy.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and real-time performance, delivering 26 FPS for both encoding and decoding steps at 12-bit quantization on the KITTI dataset.

Conclusion: By incorporating these modules, the framework establishes a compact feature representation, enhancing context modeling efficiency and accelerating the compression process, with code and results accessible for further validation.

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Droplet3D-4M, a large-scale video dataset for 3D generation, and a generative model, Droplet3D, leveraging video commonsense priors to overcome limited native 3D data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of 3D data online compared to text, image, and video. Using videos with rich commonsense priors can mitigate this limitation for 3D asset generation.

Method: The authors develop Droplet3D-4M, a dataset of videos with multi-view annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative model that accepts both image and dense text inputs.

Result: The experiments show that Droplet3D produces spatially consistent, semantically plausible 3D outcomes and is extendable to scene-level applications.

Conclusion: Commonsense priors from videos significantly improve 3D generation and generalizability, making Droplet3D a pioneering contribution in this area, with open-sourced resources provided.

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,

Method: SKGE-Swin architecture integrates the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window Multi-head Self-Attention (SW-MSA) and skip-stage mechanisms to globally expand feature extraction and retain critical information across network stages.

Result: The SKGE-Swin model outperforms previous methods by achieving a superior Driving Score in simulations conducted on the CARLA platform under adversarial scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed SKGE-Swin architecture effectively improves autonomous vehicle performance through advanced feature extraction techniques, with ablation studies confirming the importance of the Swin Transformer and skip connections.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces G^2Editor, a framework for precise and photorealistic object editing in autonomous driving videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently generate diverse and realistic corner cases essential for autonomous driving systems' training and validation, addressing limitations of visual fidelity and pose control.

Method: G^2Editor uses 3D Gaussian representation as a prior in the denoising process, incorporates bounding box layouts for occlusion handling, and introduces hierarchical fine-grained features for appearance detail enhancement.

Result: G^2Editor outperforms previous methods in pose controllability and visual quality, supporting object repositioning, insertion, and deletion in driving videos.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively generates realistic and diverse scenarios, advancing object editing capabilities and supporting data-driven tasks for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

*Marina Grifell i Plana,Vladyslav Zalevskyi,Léa Schmidt,Yvan Gomez,Thomas Sanchez,Vincent Dunet,Mériam Koob,Vanessa Siffredi,Meritxell Bach Cuadra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel domain randomization strategy for fetal brain segmentation by embedding knowledge of corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD) into synthetic data generation, significantly improving segmentation accuracy for CCD cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of the fetal brain is critical for neurodevelopment analysis, particularly in rare conditions like CCD, where data scarcity limits the generalization of deep learning models.

Method: The authors used a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy to generate synthetic data by simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy samples without needing annotations for pathological cases.

Result: The method improved segmentation for CCD cases while maintaining performance on healthy and other pathological cases. Clinically relevant biomarkers were derived with reduced estimation errors, including LCC length and volume.

Conclusion: Incorporating anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines addresses data scarcity and enables reliable analyses of rare abnormalities, enhancing segmentation accuracy and topological consistency.

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

TL;DR: Unified perception in autonomous vehicles offers a paradigm to integrate detection, tracking, and prediction into a cohesive architecture, overcoming modular pipeline limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations like error accumulation and weak inter-task synergy in modular pipelines used for autonomous vehicle perception by exploring unified perception architectures.

Method: A systematic survey categorizing approaches via task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow, alongside the introduction of taxonomies and a review of architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and open-source resources.

Result: The paper delivers a comprehensive framework for unified perception, consolidates fragmented research efforts, and highlights future directions for robust and interpretable perception systems.

Conclusion: Unified perception can lead to advancements in autonomous vehicle perception, improving robustness, efficiency, and interpretability by integrating traditionally separate tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

*Jeong Hun Yeo,Hyeongseop Rha,Sungjune Park,Junil Won,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for spoken-language text generation using various combinations of sign language, lip movements, and audio, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems like ASR do not cater to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing effectively, and the integration of sign language and lip reading in a unified framework for communication remains unexplored.

Method: The paper proposes a modality-agnostic architecture designed to process sign language, lip movements, and audio inputs, exploring their synergies, particularly the role of lip movements in sign language comprehension.

Result: The framework achieves performance matching or surpassing current state-of-the-art models specialized for specific tasks across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Modeling lip movements as a distinct modality boosts SLT performance.

Conclusion: A unified system that integrates diverse communication modalities enhances accessibility for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals while achieving competitive or superior results in related domains.

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces COMETH, a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human pose fusion that uses convex optimization techniques and biomechanical constraints, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in tracking human activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational and bandwidth limitations of centralized multi-camera setups, and the resource constraints of edge devices, for scalable, real-time human pose estimation in Industry 5.0 applications.

Method: The COMETH algorithm integrates kinematic and biomechanical constraints to improve joint accuracy, employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion, and uses a state observer for enhanced temporal consistency.

Result: COMETH was evaluated on both public and industrial datasets, showing superior localization, detection, and tracking accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm enables accurate, scalable, and real-time human motion tracking, making it suitable for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is publicly available for adoption.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

*Yuan Xie,Tianshui Chen,Zheng Ge,Lionel Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-MTR is a new framework tackling challenges in long-form video understanding by utilizing multi-turn reasoning over video segments, surpassing traditional methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video understanding presents difficulties due to long-range temporal dependencies and multiple events, and existing methods relying on external models have limitations like high complexity and poor performance due to lack of end-to-end training.

Method: The authors propose Video-MTR, which iteratively selects video segments and refines question comprehension across multiple turns, using a gated bi-level reward system for trajectory-level and turn-level optimization.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks such as VideoMME, MLVU, and EgoSchema show Video-MTR achieves higher accuracy and efficiency than current approaches.

Conclusion: Video-MTR enhances the state-of-the-art for long video reasoning through end-to-end training, multi-turn reasoning, and elimination of external reliance on visual-language models.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

*Zixuan Hu,Dongxiao Li,Xinzhu Ma,Shixiang Tang,Xiaotong Li,Wenhan Yang,Ling-Yu Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), a framework addressing semantic and geometric uncertainties in monocular 3D object detection under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) in safety-critical applications under real-world domain shifts using Test-Time Adaptation (TTA).

Method: Proposes a framework called DUO, which minimizes semantic and geometric uncertainties using a novel convex focal loss structure and semantic-aware geometric constraints.

Result: DUO shows superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple datasets and types of domain shifts.

Conclusion: DUO effectively addresses dual uncertainties in M3OD, thereby enhancing reliability and generalization in real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework aimed at enhancing efficiency and performance by mimicking human multimodal coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action models require extensive post-training, causing high computational overhead, limiting scalability and deployment.

Method: CogVLA employs a 3-stage progressive architecture: EFA-Routing for vision compression, LFP-Routing for token-level sparsity in intent, and CAtten for efficient action generation.

Result: CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art results with 97.4% success rates on LIBERO benchmark and 70.0% in real-world tasks, while cutting training costs by 2.5x and inference latency by 2.8x compared to OpenVLA.

Conclusion: CogVLA improves performance and efficiency in VLA models, making it both scalable and deployable, and is publicly available for use.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

TL;DR: The study introduces the CaddieSet dataset, linking swing posture with ball trajectory and enabling interpretable golf swing analysis using deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies lack a quantitative relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory, limiting effective insights for golfers' swing improvement.

Method: Introduces the CaddieSet dataset that captures joint and ball information from a single shot, segments swing videos into eight phases, and uses 15 key metrics for analysis based on golf domain knowledge.

Result: Demonstrates the feasibility of CaddieSet in predicting ball trajectories across benchmarks, showing consistency with expert domain knowledge using interpretable models.

Conclusion: CaddieSet provides actionable insights for improving golf swings, advancing both academic research and practical applications in the sports industry.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces IAENet, a network that combines 2D pre-trained and 3D point cloud models for improved surface anomaly detection in manufacturing, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve surface anomaly detection by leveraging both 2D and 3D data in industrial manufacturing, addressing the lack of powerful pre-trained 3D backbones.

Method: Developed Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet) with an Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module to dynamically weigh and integrate anomaly scores from 2D and 3D sources.

Result: IAENet demonstrated state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced false positive rates on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset.

Conclusion: IAENet effectively combines the strengths of 2D and 3D models, making it valuable for industrial applications that require accurate surface anomaly detection.

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DescriptiveEdit is a new technique for semantic image editing that improves accuracy and consistency by employing reference-image-based text-to-image generation, avoiding reconstruction errors and dataset limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in semantic image editing, particularly overcoming issues with reconstruction errors in inversion algorithms and dataset limitations in instruction-based models.

Method: Introducing DescriptiveEdit, which uses a Cross-Attentive UNet to integrate reference image features with text-based prompts during the generation process. This avoids architectural modifications and leverages well-trained Text-to-Image models.

Result: DescriptiveEdit enhances editing accuracy and consistency, verified using the Emu Edit benchmark. It integrates effectively with extensions like ControlNet and IP-Adapter while being scalable.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit provides a robust framework for semantic image editing, leveraging text-to-image methodologies to address existing challenges and deliver improved performance.

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

*Wenting Yin,Han Sun,Xinru Meng,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DCFS, a method for continual test-time adaptation, which improves adaptation by combining feature disentanglement and confidence-aware learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual test-time adaptation methods struggle with learning biases and error accumulation due to unreliable pseudo-labels generated during adaptation without source data.

Method: The proposed DCFS framework uses dual-path feature consistency to split target data features into semantic-related and domain-related features, while leveraging an adaptive threshold and confidence scoring to reduce noise and ensure better self-supervised learning.

Result: The method demonstrates improved performance and reduces error accumulation on datasets CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C.

Conclusion: DCFS enhances continual test-time adaptation by effectively managing feature representation and pseudo-label quality, achieving consistent performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves camera calibration for novel view synthesis by fine-tuning camera parameters using a 3DGS model and achieves a significant quality boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by inaccurate camera calibration, which impacts the quality of novel view synthesis, a method for refining calibration is needed.

Method: The paper uses a 3DGS model and backpropagates color loss from novel view synthesis to fine-tune the camera parameters.

Result: Camera calibration refinement using this method resulted in an average improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on a standard dataset.

Conclusion: The technique enhances calibration and novel view synthesis quality while being computationally expensive, but useful for reference scene calibration where high view quality matters.

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel active sequential domain adaptation framework for multi-modal medical image segmentation, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling and improving segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in segmentation for radiotherapy planning where data annotation is laborious, the authors aim to develop methods that effectively utilize smaller labeled datasets.

Method: The paper presents a novel query strategy within an active and sequential domain adaptation framework, selecting dynamic multi-modal samples for training using metrics of informativeness and representativeness.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior segmentation results for gross tumor volume tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art active domain adaptation approaches.

Conclusion: This framework enhances medical image segmentation while reducing annotation costs, showing promise for practical applications in medical domains.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

### [114] [Enhancing Pseudo-Boxes via Data-Level LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Unsupervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20530)
*Mingqian Ji,Jian Yang,Shanshan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a data-level fusion framework to enhance unsupervised 3D object detection, utilizing RGB images and LiDAR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality 3D labels are difficult to obtain due to the time-intensive annotation process, making unsupervised methods a desirable alternative.

Method: The approach employs vision foundation models for instance segmentation and depth estimation, combined with bi-directional fusion of LiDAR and RGB data, and filtering techniques to mitigate noise.

Result: Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that the proposed method achieves 28.4% mAP, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods significantly.

Conclusion: The integration of RGB images and LiDAR data at the data level leads to considerable improvements in pseudo-box generation and localization accuracy for unsupervised 3D object detection.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BMI measurement methods are often unavailable or impractical in scenarios like telehealth and emergencies, necessitating rapid alternatives.

Method: The study uses a deep learning approach trained on the WayBED dataset of smartphone images, employing automatic filtering for quality and deploying models on mobile devices using the CLAID framework.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline demonstrates high accuracy and generalization capabilities, and its open-source mobile implementation makes it accessible for real-world applications.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

Motivation: To examine the benefits and effectiveness of domain adaptation (DA) techniques for image classification, particularly in challenging medical datasets.

Method: 557 simulation studies were performed using seven DA techniques across five natural and eight medical datasets under diverse scenarios, including out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited training samples.

Result: The experiments revealed insightful observations, with DSAN achieving high accuracy (91.2%) in COVID-19 data and improving accuracy by 6.7% in dynamic data scenarios. DSAN also demonstrated strong explainability on medical datasets like COVID-19 and skin cancer.

Conclusion: DSAN is shown to have outstanding performance and explainability in medical datasets, contributing valuable insights into adapting domain adaptation techniques effectively for medical data.

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLAB, a simple yet effective technique for enhancing video object detection through improved feature representation and training dynamics, achieving state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet VID dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video object detection suffers from challenges such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes, which degrade image quality and detection performance without additional computational load during inference.

Method: The method involves adding a contrastive auxiliary branch to the detector's backbone and utilizing a dynamic loss weighting strategy that transitions focus from auxiliary features to detection as training progresses.

Result: The proposed CLAB framework achieves 84.0% mAP with ResNet-101 and 85.2% mAP with ResNeXt-101 on the ImageNet VID dataset, surpassing prior CNN-based models.

Conclusion: CLAB demonstrates that robust video object detection can be achieved simply and effectively without complex post-processing, delivering state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

*Lorenz Hufe,Constantin Venhoff,Maximilian Dreyer,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on typographic attacks on Vision-Language Models and introduces a training-free defense method to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities in Vision-Language Models like CLIP, which are susceptible to typographic attacks injecting malicious text into images.

Method: The paper identifies specialized attention circuits in CLIP models that extract typographic features and proposes ablating these circuits as a defense mechanism, without requiring model finetuning.

Result: Their method improves robustness against typographic attacks, raising accuracy by up to 19.6% on a specialized dataset while reducing standard accuracy marginally (<1%).

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a competitive training-free defense against typographic attacks, demonstrating potential in safety-critical applications without compromising much utility.

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like occlusion, variability, and interpretability in facial expression recognition by leveraging graph neural networks.

Method: The approach involves extracting 3D facial landmarks, constructing quotient graphs through hierarchical coarsening, and embedding facial landmark regions for emotion recognition.

Result: GLaRE achieved 64.89% accuracy on AffectNet and 94.24% on FERG, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies validate improved performance due to region-level embeddings.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-based landmark region embedding improves facial emotion recognition accuracy, offering advantages in structure preservation and interpretation.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

*Zheng Chong,Yanwei Lei,Shiyue Zhang,Zhuandi He,Zhen Wang,Xujie Zhang,Xiao Dong,Yiling Wu,Dongmei Jiang,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents FastFit, a multi-reference virtual try-on framework utilizing a cacheable diffusion architecture for improved efficiency and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual try-on technologies face limitations in handling multi-reference outfit compositions and suffer from inefficiencies caused by redundant computations during the denoising process.

Method: The paper introduces FastFit, which employs a Semi-Attention mechanism and class embeddings to decouple reference feature encoding from the denoising process. Reference features are computed once and reused, significantly improving speed and efficiency.

Result: FastFit achieves a 3.5x speedup over comparable methods and surpasses state-of-the-art virtual try-on models in fidelity metrics. The authors also present DressCode-MR, a new dataset for multi-reference virtual try-on research, alongside evaluations on several datasets.

Conclusion: FastFit resolves efficiency challenges and enables high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on. The proposed method not only improves inference speed but also maintains superior visual fidelity. The DressCode-MR dataset further enhances research avenues in this domain.

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

*Yuqi Han,Songqian Zhang,Weijian Su,Ke Li,Jiayu Yang,Jinli Suo,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents UTA-Sign, a system combining thermal and event cameras to enhance traffic signage detection in low-light environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal cameras struggle with signage recognition in low-light settings, posing safety risks in autonomous driving. Event cameras offer complementary advantages in capturing light intensity changes efficiently.

Method: UTA-Sign integrates thermal frames and event signals using a dual-boosting mechanism to enhance signage representation. Thermal data aligns uneven event signals, while events refine thermal images for better semantic understanding.

Result: The proposed fusion method outperforms traditional approaches in accurately sketching traffic signage and improving detection quality, validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Combining thermal and event camera data using the dual-boosting method enhances autonomous system reliability in low-illumination traffic environments.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an active defense against deepfake attacks by using low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current passive deepfake detection methods by providing an active defense mechanism to prevent privacy and security risks.

Method: The authors propose a model leveraging low-frequency perceptual perturbations and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to interfere with the deepfake generative process while maintaining visual plausibility.

Result: Experiments on datasets like CelebA-HQ and LFW show reductions in deepfake effectiveness, improved defense success, and preserved visual quality.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates a novel active defense approach combining frequency and spatial domain features, significantly advancing deepfake prevention methods while maintaining human-perceptible visuals.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Diverse-T2M, a method to improve the diversity of 3D human motion generation from text while retaining semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving diversity in 3D human motion generation from text, which remains a notable challenge despite advancements in quality and precision.

Method: The method introduces uncertainty using noise signals and constructs a latent space with stochastic sampling for diverse yet consistent motion generation.

Result: Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets show that Diverse-T2M generates significantly more diverse motions while maintaining high text-motion consistency.

Conclusion: The method successfully overcomes the diversity generation challenge, providing a simple and effective solution for text-to-motion tasks.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Motivation: Interpreting intraoperative ultrasound in liver surgery is difficult due to the limited field of view and the organ's complex structure. Bridging preoperative data with intraoperative imaging is necessary for better guidance.

Method: The paper presents an optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for aligning IVUS data with CT images. The approach allows precise reconstruction and registration of the liver anatomy.

Result: The proposed method achieved a calibration error ranging from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm in swine liver images.

Conclusion: The method provides an accurate and reliable way to register and reconstruct liver images for facilitating effective intraoperative guidance in liver surgeries.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

TL;DR: Proposed a method to generate synthetic Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) data using Physics Informed Generative Models to aid ML in semiconductor defect detection and localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defect detection in semiconductor manufacturing requires efficient localization techniques. Scarcity of real MFI datasets limits the training of ML models for defect localization.

Method: Developed Physics Informed Generative Models (PI-GenMFI) leveraging diffusion models with physical constraints to generate synthetic MFI data.

Result: Generated MFI images for common defect types like power shorts, validated by domain experts and compared against SOTA generative models, showing promising performance.

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI demonstrates potential for improving ML-driven defect localization in semiconductor manufacturing by providing high-quality synthetic MFI data.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

*Yixiang Qiu,Yanhan Liu,Hongyao Yu,Hao Fang,Bin Chen,Shu-Tao Xia,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy risks in Split Inference due to Data Reconstruction Attacks, proposing a GAN-based method with Progressive Feature Optimization to improve reconstruction quality and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address privacy risks posed by Data Reconstruction Attacks in Split Inference, where intermediate features are exploited to recover sensitive data, particularly targeting the limitations of existing methods for deeper models and diverse datasets.

Method: The authors propose a GAN-based Data Reconstruction Attack framework with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), using hierarchical blocks for incremental refinement and an L1-ball constraint for stabilization and improved realism.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed method surpasses prior reconstruction attacks significantly, especially in high-resolution situations, out-of-distribution conditions, and with deeper, more complex DNNs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances semantic fidelity and effectiveness of data reconstructions in challenging scenarios, demonstrating its potential as a substantial improvement over existing DRA methods.

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EmoCAST, a framework for generating realistic, emotionally expressive talking head videos using diffusion techniques and specialized modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations in control flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality in emotional talking head synthesis.

Method: EmoCAST incorporates a text-guided decoupled emotive module and an emotive audio attention module, complemented by a newly constructed dataset and refined training strategies.

Result: The framework enhances emotion comprehension, improves facial motion synthesis, and achieves superior lip-synchronization.

Conclusion: EmoCAST displays state-of-the-art performance in creating realistic, emotion-driven talking head videos suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's

*Smriti Joshi,Lidia Garrucho,Richard Osuala,Oliver Diaz,Karim Lekadir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a SwinUNETR-based AI method that achieved second place in the ODELIA breast cancer diagnosis challenge using multi-center breast MRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early breast cancer diagnosis and classification, particularly in high-risk groups or cases where mammography performance is limited.

Method: The researchers developed a deep learning framework based on SwinUNETR that includes breast region masking, data augmentation, and ensemble learning.

Result: The method achieved second place in a multi-center AI challenge, demonstrating good performance on a diverse dataset of 511 breast MRI studies.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows significant promise in supporting clinical breast MRI interpretation and is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

### [129] [AvatarBack: Back-Head Generation for Complete 3D Avatars from Front-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20623)
*Shiqi Xin,Xiaolin Zhang,Yanbin Liu,Peng Zhang,Caifeng Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack is a framework that solves incomplete 3D Gaussian head avatars by reconstructing back-head regions with innovative techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D Gaussian head avatars struggle with accurately modeling the back-head regions, which reduces the overall realism and fidelity of the avatars.

Method: AvatarBack uses a two-part system: (1) a Subject-specific Generator (SSG) that synthesizes plausible back-view images from sparse frontal data, and (2) an Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA) that aligns these views with the 3D Gaussians through learnable transformation matrices.

Result: AvatarBack improves the reconstruction of back-head regions, as validated through geometric, photometric, and perceptual metrics, while maintaining the fidelity of the front view.

Conclusion: This framework enhances the completeness and realism of 3D Gaussian avatars, making them fully animatable and consistent under various motions.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

*Francois Poh,Anjith George,Sébastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes fine-tuning foundation models to improve facial recognition in historical paintings, overcoming challenges posed by artistic factors and outperforms traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of subjective identification of sitters in historical paintings and the shortcomings of traditional facial recognition models in handling domain shifts and high artistic variability.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings with those of conventional facial recognition networks to enhance recognition accuracy.

Result: The approach demonstrates notable improvements over current state-of-the-art facial recognition methods for artwork identification.

Conclusion: Foundation models, when fine-tuned and integrated, can effectively bridge the gap in facial recognition for artworks, overcoming challenges faced by traditional methods.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

*Ayan Banerjee,Fernando Vilariño,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti is a text-guided graffiti generation framework that preserves facial identity under stylistic transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of maintaining facial identity in generative art, especially in high-contrast graffiti styles where distortions can erase recognizability.

Method: The framework uses graffiti style transfer with LoRA-fine-tuned diffusion transformers and augments attention layers with identity embeddings. It enables pose customization through CLIP-guided prompt extension.

Result: It achieves state-of-the-art aesthetic scores and facial consistency, validates its approach empirically, and demonstrates creative impact via real-world deployment.

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti blends artistic freedom with facial recognizability, offering a principled system for identity-preserving AI-assisted generative art.

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

### [132] [Improving Alignment in LVLMs with Debiased Self-Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20655)
*Sihan Yang,Chenhang Cui,Zihao Zhao,Yiyang Zhou,Weilong Yan,Ying Wei,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses hallucination issues in LVLMs by introducing a self-evaluation approach independent of external datasets, which improves model alignment and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges exist in aligning visual and linguistic modalities in LVLMs, leading to hallucinations and safety concerns. Current methods rely heavily on external resources, increasing costs and scalability limitations.

Method: The authors propose a debiased self-judgment score, an internally generated self-evaluation metric, allowing autonomous improvement of model alignment without external resources.

Result: The proposed method reduces hallucinations, enhances safety, and improves overall model capability, outperforming traditional alignment methods empirically.

Conclusion: A more effective and independent solution for aligning LVLMs has been developed, promoting scalability and reducing reliance on external datasets.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

*Anastasios Skoularikis,Stefanos-Iordanis Papadopoulos,Symeon Papadopoulos,Panagiotis C. Petrantonakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents S-HArM, a new multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification of AI-generated images, and studies methods to better understand intent behind such images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to detecting AI-generated images largely ignore understanding the intent behind their creation.

Method: S-HArM dataset was created with labeled image-text pairs from social platforms (Twitter/X and Reddit) in categories like Humor/Satire, Art, and Misinformation. Additionally, multiple prompting strategies were used to generate synthetic training datasets for model evaluation.

Result: Models trained on synthetically generated image- and multimodally-guided datasets show better generalization to real-world content but overall performance in inferring intent remains limited.

Conclusion: Understanding intent behind AI-generated images is complex, necessitating further development of specialized architectures to tackle the challenges effectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MobileCLIP2, an improved version of the MobileCLIP image-text models, demonstrating better zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet-1k while maintaining low latency and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance the zero-shot capabilities and efficiency of MobileCLIP models, addressing the need for scalable, light, and low-latency image-text models that can compete with larger versions in accuracy.

Method: The paper improves the training process by integrating better CLIP teacher ensembles, improving caption-generator teachers, and conducting ablations to identify key training components like temperature tuning and caption diversity. They also combine synthetic captions from multiple models for additive gains.

Result: MobileCLIP2 achieves state-of-the-art ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracy, with significant improvements over its predecessor. For instance, MobileCLIP2-B demonstrates a 2.2% accuracy increase over MobileCLIP-B. The models also outperform larger architectures like SigLIP-SO400M/14 and DFN ViT-L/14 in resource efficiency.

Conclusion: MobileCLIP2 sets a new benchmark for efficient zero-shot image-text models, proving that smaller architectures can achieve high accuracy without sacrificing performance. The released pretrained models and data generation code provide open access for further research and applications.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of precise rate control in Neural Video Compression by proposing a dynamic video compression framework for variable bitrate scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise rate control in learning-based codecs for Neural Video Compression remains a challenge, especially for variable bitrate scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces Dynamic-Route Autoencoder, Rate Control Agent, and Joint-Routes Optimization strategy for collaborative training and adaptation to target bitrates.

Result: Experiments on HEVC and UVG datasets show 14.8% BD-Rate reduction, 0.47dB BD-PSNR gain, and 1.66% average bitrate error compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework achieves Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization for various bitrate scenarios while surpassing existing methods in performance.

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

*Reza Akbari Movahed,Abuzar Rezaee,Arezoo Zakeri,Colin Berry,Edmond S. L. Ho,Ali Gooya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CardioMorphNet, a recurrent Bayesian deep learning method for improved cardiac motion estimation with lower uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cardiac motion estimation is crucial for diagnosing heart function and abnormalities, but existing methods struggle due to reliance on intensity-based losses.

Method: CardioMorphNet models spatio-temporal dependencies with a recurrent variational autoencoder and includes segmentation maps in its Bayesian framework for deformable registration, yielding uncertainty maps.

Result: CardioMorphNet excels in motion estimation and generates lower uncertainty values than state-of-the-art probabilistic methods, validated using the UK Biobank dataset.

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet provides superior cardiac motion estimation and high confidence predictions, addressing limitations of intensity-based approaches.

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) under domain shifts by proposing a domain-robust classification approach that enhances feature diversity, aligns domain-specific features, and stabilizes predictions using teacher-student distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying AMFs is crucial for histopathology but challenging due to domain shifts caused by variations in scanner, stain, and acquisition settings.

Method: The proposed method improves domain robustness through (i) feature diversity via style perturbations, (ii) domain feature alignment using auxiliary loss with weak labels, and (iii) prediction stability via EMA teacher-student distillation.

Result: Achieved balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499 in atypical mitosis classification on the MIDOG 2025 leaderboard.

Conclusion: The approach is lightweight, requires minimal domain metadata, and delivers strong performance, making it competitive for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses reward hacking issues in GRPO-based T2I generation by introducing Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference reward method, and a comprehensive T2I benchmark called UniGenBench for detailed model evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the vulnerabilities in current GRPO-based T2I generation methods caused by reward hacking and to improve benchmarking practices for better model assessment.

Method: The Pref-GRPO method replaces pointwise score maximization with pairwise preference fitting, using win rate as a reward signal. A new benchmark, UniGenBench, is introduced for more detailed T2I model evaluation.

Result: Pref-GRPO ensures stable training by mitigating reward hacking, enhances the ability to differentiate subtle image quality differences, and UniGenBench provides a unified and comprehensive evaluation framework.

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO and UniGenBench together enhance both the stability of T2I training processes and the comprehensiveness of T2I model evaluation systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Motivation: Existing approaches for novel view synthesis fail to encode discriminative multi-view consistent features for Gaussian predictions, leading to challenges in constructing accurate geometry with sparse input views.

Method: The authors propose a unified architecture that integrates three lightweight modules which incorporate context-aware, cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints to improve feature fusion and rendering quality.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering quality and superior generalization ability for the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The C³-GS framework shows improved photorealistic synthesis and generalization without needing per-scene optimization, addressing limitations of existing methods and showing practical value for novel view generation tasks.

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

*Jiawen Lin,Shiran Bian,Yihang Zhu,Wenbin Tan,Yachao Zhang,Yuan Xie,Yanyun Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SeqVLM, a zero-shot framework for 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG), which utilizes multi-view imagery and spatial information to localize objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, emphasizing robustness and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot methods in 3DVG are crucial for real-world applications as they eliminate the need for scene-specific training. However, existing methods struggle with spatial reasoning and contextual preservation.

Method: SeqVLM works by generating 3D instance proposals, filtering them semantically, projecting them onto multi-view images to retain spatial and contextual details, and using a dynamic scheduling mechanism for efficient visual-language reasoning.

Result: SeqVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks, with Acc@0.25 scores of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%, respectively.

Conclusion: SeqVLM significantly advances zero-shot 3DVG by improving generalization and real-world applicability, setting a new performance benchmark.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

*Jan Erik van Woerden,Gertjan Burghouts,Lotte Nijskens,Alma M. Liezenga,Sabina van Rooij,Frank Ruis,Hugo J. Kuijf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the robustness of CLIP variants in military applications under occlusion conditions using a dataset of 18 military vehicle classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the robustness of CLIP in challenging military environments, particularly against partial occlusions and low signal-to-noise ratios.

Method: CLIP variants were evaluated using a custom dataset and performance measured using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across various occlusion levels.

Result: (1) Transformer-based CLIP models outperform CNNs; (2) dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than contiguous ones; (3) performance of linear-probed models drops around 35% occlusion, fine-tuned models at over 60% occlusion.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need for occlusion-specific training augmentations and further research into architectural and patch-level sensitivities for effective real-world deployment.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

### [142] [Looking Beyond the Obvious: A Survey on Abstract Concept Recognition for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20765)
*Gowreesh Mago,Pascal Mettes,Stevan Rudinac*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper surveys the progress in abstract concept recognition in video understanding, emphasizing how foundation models can advance this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at recognizing abstract concepts like justice and togetherness in videos, a capability machines lack. Bridging this gap could enable better video content understanding aligned with human reasoning.

Method: The paper surveys tasks and datasets from past attempts at addressing abstract concept recognition in videos and discusses how foundation models offer a more effective approach.

Result: The study highlights the progress and limitations of past methods and argues for leveraging insights from the research community alongside recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models.

Conclusion: Drawing on past work and utilizing foundation models can collectively address the open challenge of abstract video understanding, avoiding redundant efforts and improving alignment with human concepts.

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

### [143] [Safer Skin Lesion Classification with Global Class Activation Probability Map Evaluation and SafeML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20776)
*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Amila Akagić,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed a novel method for explainable AI in skin lesion classification, addressing trust and reliability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distrust in AI diagnostic models due to issues with explainability methods and desire for trustworthy, visualized diagnostic processes.

Method: Developed Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation for pixel-level probabilistic analysis and integrated SafeML for detecting diagnostic errors.

Result: Evaluation conducted on ISIC datasets using MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformers demonstrated improved explainability and diagnostic safety.

Conclusion: Enhances trustworthiness and reliability of skin lesion diagnosis, supporting safer medical practices.

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

### [144] [Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20783)
*Beth Pearson,Bilal Boulbarss,Michael Wray,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines the compositional generalization abilities of vision-language models, specifically diffusion classifiers, CLIP, and ViLT, in recognizing object attributes and relationships. Results show improvements in concept binding tasks but significant struggles with relational reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to improve compositional semantics in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), addressing their limitations in accurately representing novel combinations of known elements, such as distinguishing between attribute-object pairings or relational concepts.

Method: The authors assess three models—Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT—on their ability to perform compositional tasks in both zero-shot (ZSL) and generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) setups. They analyze embeddings to diagnose challenges in relational reasoning among the models.

Result: The Diffusion Classifier and ViLT are shown to perform well in concept binding tasks, but all three models, including CLIP, struggle significantly with relational GZSL tasks. The issues seem to stem from inadequacies in relational concept representations.

Conclusion: While diffusion-based models like Diffusion Classifier show promise in overcoming some compositional challenges, relational reasoning remains a significant hurdle for VLMs. The research highlights key areas for improvement and provides datasets for further study.

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

### [145] [ChainReaction! Structured Approach with Causal Chains as Intermediate Representations for Improved and Explainable Causal Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21010)
*Paritosh Parmar,Eric Peh,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular framework is proposed for causal reasoning in VideoQA using interpretable natural language causal chains instead of black-box models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for VideoQA struggle with higher-order reasoning, lack interpretability, and rely on shallow heuristics.

Method: The framework consists of two components: a Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA). Natural language causal chains serve as intermediate representations.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks show improved performance, explainability, user trust, and generalization over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: This new framework enhances causal reasoning in VideoQA, offering reusable components and advancing transparency and demonstrated effectiveness.

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

### [146] [Surfel-based 3D Registration with Equivariant SE(3) Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20789)
*Xueyang Kang,Hang Zhao,Kourosh Khoshelham,Patrick Vandewalle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel surfel-based pose learning approach for point cloud registration, addressing orientation and uncertainty issues by using SE(3)-equivariant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud registration methods often fail in the presence of noisy data or aggressive transformations due to neglecting orientation and uncertainty aspects.

Method: The proposed method initializes surfels from LiDAR using virtual camera parameters, employs SE(3)-equivariant convolutional kernels for feature learning, and uses a cross-attention mechanism and non-linear Huber loss to compute transformations.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrated superior and robust performance in indoor and outdoor datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This approach effectively handles point cloud uncertainty and aggressive transformations, providing robust registration without the need for extensive training augmentations.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

### [147] [Adapting Foundation Model for Dental Caries Detection with Dual-View Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20813)
*Tao Luo,Han Wu,Tong Yang,Dinggang Shen,Zhiming Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training network, for accurate dental caries detection, which integrates information from global X-ray images and localized tooth patches through a Gated Cross-View Attention module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods for dental caries on panoramic X-rays struggle due to subtle contrast differences and diverse lesion morphologies, motivating the creation of a more robust detection mechanism inspired by clinical workflows.

Method: DVCTNet employs automated tooth detection to generate dual views (global from panoramic X-rays and local from tooth patches), uses two pretrained vision models for feature extraction, and integrates these features via the Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module for precise dental caries identification.

Result: DVCTNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods based on evaluations on a public dataset and a newly curated dataset, both featuring high annotation precision.

Conclusion: The proposed DVCTNet demonstrates superior detection performance and clinical potential, providing a robust tool for accurate dental caries identification.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

### [148] [FusionCounting: Robust visible-infrared image fusion guided by crowd counting via multi-task learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20817)
*He Li,Xinyu Liu,Weihang Kong,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FusionCounting, a multi-task learning framework integrating visible-infrared image fusion (VIF) with crowd counting, achieving improved image fusion quality and crowd estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most VIF methods focus on image quality, while recent methods incorporating tasks like segmentation and object detection face challenges like annotation efforts and scene complexities. Crowd counting offers a simpler annotation solution for dense scenes but has not been integrated with VIF before.

Method: FusionCounting combines crowd counting and VIF via a multi-task framework. It employs a dynamic loss weighting strategy to balance tasks and adversarial training to improve robustness and stability.

Result: FusionCounting outperforms existing methods in both image fusion quality and crowd counting accuracy, as demonstrated on public datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating VIF and crowd counting in one framework maximizes the complementary strengths of both tasks, offering efficient solutions for dense scene analysis and image fusion challenges.

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pipeline for estimating 2D keypoints of surgical tools leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine-tuned using LoRA, outperforming CNNs and Transformers on small medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of overfitting in small-scale medical datasets in keypoint estimation tasks by utilizing robust generalization capabilities of pre-trained Vision Language Models.

Method: A prompting strategy is designed for instruction-tuning, combining LoRA (low rank adjusting) to fine-tune pre-trained Vision Language Models. Visual and semantic features are aligned for enhanced learning.

Result: The fine-tuned VLMs surpass traditional CNN or Transformer-based models in only two epochs, showcasing improved performance in surgical tool keypoint detection under low-resource conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline leverages VLMs and LoRA to effectively tackle small-scale dataset challenges, marking an advancement in 2D keypoint detection as well as paving avenues for 3D pose estimation in surgical tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

*Hao Yang,Qianyu Zhou,Haijia Sun,Xiangtai Li,Xuequan Lu,Lizhuang Ma,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents PointDGRWKV, a RWKV-based framework for improving the generalization of point cloud classification models across unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for Domain Generalization in Point Cloud Classification suffer from issues such as limited receptive fields, high computational costs, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling.

Method: The study introduces Adaptive Geometric Token Shift for better spatial modeling and Cross-Domain Key Feature Distribution Alignment to enhance cross-domain robustness, while leveraging RWKV’s linear complexity and global receptive fields.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves superior performance on multiple domain generalization benchmarks for point cloud classification.

Conclusion: PointDGRWKV effectively overcomes RWKV’s existing limitations and establishes new state-of-the-art results for DG point cloud classification.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

TL;DR: PathMR is a novel multimodal visual reasoning framework that links pathological image analysis and cell-level diagnostics with detailed textual explanations, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limited clinical adoption of deep learning in pathology due to opaque decision-making and lack of interpretability.

Method: The authors propose PathMR, a framework that analyzes pathological images by combining segmentation masks and expert-level diagnostic narratives with cell distribution pattern predictions.

Result: PathMR surpasses existing methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment, validated on the PathGen and GADVR datasets.

Conclusion: PathMR enhances interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis, highlighting its potential for clinical application, with the code available for public use.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning framework using dual-modality imaging for early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), achieving over 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has poor survival rates due to late detection, necessitating improved methods for early diagnosis.

Method: The research compared various deep learning architectures, including CNNs and Vision Transformers, analyzing dual-modality imaging of 40 patient samples. They selected a ResNet-based framework with pre-trained layers and class-weighted training to address dataset limitations.

Result: The optimized model achieved over 90% accuracy in detecting cancer and outperformed existing manual analysis methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust pipeline for automating PDAC detection, with potential for clinical deployment and adaptation to other cancer types, while addressing challenges in small medical datasets.

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

### [153] [Understanding and evaluating computer vision models through the lens of counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20881)
*Pushkar Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This thesis proposes counterfactual reasoning methods to explain, audit, and reduce biases in vision classifiers and generative models by varying semantic attributes to assess and improve model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual reasoning is essential for creating interpretable and fair AI systems, but scalable methods to mitigate biases in vision classifiers and generative models are underdeveloped.

Method: The thesis introduces frameworks like CAVLI, ASAC, TIBET, BiasConnect, and InterMit to analyze and mitigate biases using counterfactual techniques. These methods involve tools like concept attribution, adversarial training, and causal graph analysis.

Result: Techniques are presented for detecting reliance on irrelevant cues in classifiers, identifying prompt-sensitive biases in generative models, and mitigating biases without harming model accuracy.

Conclusion: Counterfactual reasoning offers scalable and principled methods for improving interpretability and fairness in AI systems, aiding in socially responsible deployment of vision classifiers and generative models.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dino U-Net, an encoder-decoder architecture leveraging the dense features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model for superior medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transferring representations from foundation models to clinical applications efficiently remains a challenge in medical image segmentation.

Method: The proposed Dino U-Net uses a frozen DINOv3 backbone for the encoder with an adapter to fuse semantic and spatial features, alongside a fidelity-aware projection module to refine features for dimensionality reduction.

Result: Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven medical segmentation datasets across various imaging modalities, with improved accuracy as the model size increases.

Conclusion: The study validates that utilizing dense-pretrained features from general-purpose foundation models is a scalable and parameter-efficient approach to enhancing medical image segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an ensemble of ConvNeXtBase models with a rule-based refinement (RBR) module for classifying atypical mitotic figures (AMFs), with a balanced accuracy of 84.02% on a test set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in distinguishing atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) from normal mitotic figures (NMFs), due to the subjective and time-consuming nature of manual annotation, necessitated the development of a reliable and automated classification method.

Method: The study employed an ensemble of ConvNeXtBase models trained with AUCMEDI and enhanced with a rule-based refinement (RBR) module.

Result: The ensemble achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02% on the MIDOG25 test set. The inclusion of RBR increased specificity but negatively impacted sensitivity and overall performance.

Conclusion: Deep learning ensembles are effective for AMF classification, and while RBR shows potential in boosting specificity, further research is needed to improve its integration without reducing sensitivity.

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of high-performance networks in lightweight application scenarios by developing a more efficient model.

Method: Integrating CSPNet, optimizing Stem and Block structures, and replacing Layer Scale with channel attention in ConvNeXt to create E-ConvNeXt.

Result: E-ConvNeXt-mini achieves 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at 0.9GFLOPs, and E-ConvNeXt-small achieves 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs, demonstrating better accuracy-efficiency balance.

Conclusion: E-ConvNeXt effectively reduces complexity and enhances efficiency, making it suitable for lightweight tasks, while maintaining excellent accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized
designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy
performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental
validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior
accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at
0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer
learning tests on object detection tasks further confirm its generalization

*Chenfan Qu,Yiwu Zhong,Bin Li,Lianwen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenge of localizing manipulated regions within images, introducing novel methods and tools to address data scarcity, leading to improved model performance in forgery benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the risks manipulated images pose to viewers and social security, coupled with the challenge posed by the lack of high-quality annotated datasets for manipulation localization.

Method: The authors utilize web data, manually forged images, and an auxiliary task to introduce CAAAv2 for pixel-level annotations, alongside QES to filter unreliable annotations. They also present Object Jitter for enhanced model training.

Result: They construct MIMLv2—a large-scale dataset—and develop Web-IML, which leverages web-scale supervision, yielding a performance improvement of 31%, outperforming previous methods by 24.1 average IoU points.

Conclusion: Leveraging web supervision significantly addresses data scarcity, resulting in meaningful advancements in image manipulation localization. The publicly available dataset and code further encourage research and practical application.

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: ExpertSim is a deep learning-based simulation for the Zero Degree Calorimeter in CERN's ALICE experiment, offering efficient and accurate detector simulations using a Mixture-of-Generative-Experts approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Monte Carlo simulation methods for particle collisions are computationally expensive and inefficient for the complex and varied data from the Large Hadron Collider, creating a need for faster and more precise techniques.

Method: ExpertSim introduces a Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture where specialized generative models (experts) simulate distinct subsets of calorimeter response data, improving overall accuracy and efficiency.

Result: ExpertSim enhances simulation accuracy and achieves a significant speed increase over traditional Monte Carlo methods, making it suitable for high-efficiency simulations in particle physics.

Conclusion: The proposed ExpertSim framework demonstrates the potential of deep learning architectures to address computational bottlenecks in high-energy physics simulations, offering a scalable and precise alternative to Monte Carlo techniques.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

### [161] [POSE: Phased One-Step Adversarial Equilibrium for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21019)
*Jiaxiang Cheng,Bing Ma,Xuhua Ren,Hongyi Jin,Kai Yu,Peng Zhang,Wenyue Li,Yuan Zhou,Tianxiang Zheng,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POSE significantly accelerates video diffusion generation by introducing a novel distillation framework, reducing latency from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds while ensuring high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for accelerating large-scale video diffusion models struggle with inefficiencies in sampling and fail to model temporal coherence.

Method: POSE consists of three key components: stability priming, unified adversarial equilibrium, and conditional adversarial consistency, enabling single-step generation of realistic videos.

Result: POSE achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving semantic alignment, temporal coherence, and frame quality, outperforming existing methods and reducing latency 100-fold.

Conclusion: POSE offers a robust solution to key bottlenecks in video diffusion sampling, facilitating efficient and high-quality video generation in a single step.

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method is introduced to enhance computational efficiency in text-to-image diffusion models by sharing computations across similar prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models offer high-quality image generation but are computationally intensive, motivating the need to improve efficiency especially across similar prompts.

Method: The method clusters prompts based on semantic similarity and shares computation during early steps of the hierarchical diffusion process without requiring additional training.

Result: The approach reduces compute costs and environmental impact, while improving image quality through optimized diffusion step allocation.

Conclusion: The method integrates smoothly into existing systems, scales effectively with prompt sets, and addresses efficiency challenges in large-scale text-to-image creation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses mitosis detection under domain shift in histopathology images using a Mamba-based approach and VM-UNet architecture, alongside stain augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome performance drops in mitosis detection models caused by domain shift in histopathology images.

Method: Uses the Mamba framework, VM-UNet for mitosis detection, and stain augmentation to improve model robustness under domain shift.

Result: Preliminary experiments on the MIDOG++ dataset show significant room for improvement in the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed approach exhibits potential for domain generalization tasks in medical imaging but requires further refinement.

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-task learning approach to address performance drops in machine learning models under domain shifts, specifically for identifying atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often suffer significant performance drops under domain shifts, which affects their ability to reliably identify atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images, a critical task for assessing tumor aggressiveness.

Method: A multi-task learning approach is used, leveraging auxiliary tasks correlated to the primary classification task, to help models focus on relevant features (mitotic figures) while ignoring background variations caused by domain shifts.

Result: The approach demonstrated promising preliminary performance in tests involving three datasets: MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training Set, Ami-Br dataset, and the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25 challenge.

Conclusion: Using multi-task learning, the method shows potential in mitigating domain shift issues and improving the reliability of machine learning models in histopathology image analysis.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FW-GAN proposes a framework for one-shot handwriting synthesis to generate realistic and stylistically consistent text by addressing limitations of current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled handwriting data limits handwriting recognition systems, and current handwriting synthesis methods fail to effectively model complex stroke patterns and utilize frequency information.

Method: The authors propose FW-GAN, incorporating a phase-aware Wave-MLP generator and a frequency-guided discriminator that captures fine details and enhances authenticity. Additionally, a novel Frequency Distribution Loss aligns synthetic and real handwriting frequency characteristics.

Result: Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting datasets show that FW-GAN generates high-quality and style-consistent handwriting, suitable for augmenting low-resource handwriting recognition systems.

Conclusion: FW-GAN effectively improves handwriting synthesis by leveraging spatial and frequency information, offering a valuable resource for enhancing handwriting recognition pipelines.

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

*Junpeng Ma,Qizhe Zhang,Ming Lu,Zhibin Wang,Qiang Zhou,Jun Song,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMG-Vid improves video understanding by pruning redundant visual tokens without compromising performance, leading to a significant reduction in computation and acceleration in processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the computational inefficiency of existing Video Large Language Models due to excessive visual tokens, especially given their limited capability in addressing temporal dependencies of video frames dynamically.

Method: MMG-Vid combines a training-free framework for pruning visual tokens through segment-level and token-level optimization. It uses a temporal-guided DPC algorithm to jointly model inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity.

Result: MMG-Vid reduces visual tokens by 75%, accelerates the prefilling stage by 3.9x, and sustains over 99.5% of the original performance on LLaVA-OneVision-7B.

Conclusion: MMG-Vid demonstrates that efficient video token pruning can be achieved without losses in performance, making it a practical solution for real-world applications involving video understanding.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings of existing deepfake detection benchmarks which do not align well with real-world industrial practices, hindering practical detector deployment.

Method: The paper develops the HydraFake dataset to simulate real-world deepfake challenges with diverse forgery techniques and robust evaluation setups and proposes the Veritas detector using multi-modal large language models with pattern-aware reasoning for enhanced detection.

Result: Experiments on HydraFake showed that previous detectors struggle with unseen forgeries and domains. Veritas outperformed them by achieving better generalization and delivering reliable detection results.

Conclusion: The proposed HydraFake dataset and Veritas detector together improve the ability to detect diverse and unseen deepfakes, bridging the gap between academic benchmarks and real-world requirements.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FakeParts, subtle partial deepfake manipulations that are harder to detect, and provides a benchmark dataset FakePartsBench for advancing detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection systems struggle to identify partial manipulations in videos, creating an urgent vulnerability.

Method: The authors created FakePartsBench, a large-scale benchmark dataset with detailed annotations (pixel-level and frame-level) for evaluating detection of partial deepfakes.

Result: User studies show a 30% reduction in human detection accuracy compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar challenges for current detection models.

Conclusion: Partial deepfakes represent a notable and urgent challenge; this paper contributes key resources for improving detection methods.

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

TL;DR: This paper proposes the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker that overcomes occlusion and depth ambiguities using fewer cameras for robust, real-time tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular trackers struggle with depth ambiguities and occlusion while prior multi-camera methods require many cameras and tedious per-sequence optimization.

Method: The tracker fuses multi-view features into a unified point cloud with known camera poses and depth data, applying k-nearest-neighbors correlation and a transformer-based update to predict 3D trajectories.

Result: The tracker trained on 5K synthetic sequences achieves median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm on two real-world benchmarks, generalizing well across diverse setups of 1-8 cameras and varying video lengths.

Conclusion: Releasing the tracker and datasets aims to set a new benchmark for multi-view 3D tracking and enable practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the inefficiencies and lack of generalization in existing task-specific supervised fine-tuning methods for multi-task generative models, especially for tasks with diverse objectives and varied data distributions.

Method: The proposed method, OneReward, employs a single vision-language model as a generative reward system and uses multi-task reinforcement learning on a pre-trained base model. It eliminates the need for task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Result: The unified model, Seedream 3.0 Fill, based on OneReward, outperforms existing commercial and open-source solutions (e.g., Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, FLUX Fill [Pro]) across various evaluation metrics for mask-guided image generation tasks.

Conclusion: OneReward demonstrates strong generalization and efficiency by addressing diverse multi-task generation needs using a single reward model, eliminating the limitations of task-specific SFT.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

### [172] [First-Place Solution to NeurIPS 2024 Invisible Watermark Removal Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21072)
*Fahad Shamshad,Tameem Bakr,Yahia Shaaban,Noor Hussein,Karthik Nandakumar,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a solution to a challenge focused on testing the robustness of digital image watermarking against adversarial attacks, achieving near-perfect watermark removal while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and stress-test the robustness of existing digital image watermarking methods against adversarial attacks, highlighting vulnerabilities.

Method: Adaptive VAE-based evasion attack for the beige-box track, and clustering with diffusion models guided by ChatGPT-generated captions for the black-box track.

Result: Near-perfect watermark removal (95.7% success rate) with minimal impact on image quality.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates vulnerabilities in current watermarking technologies and encourages the development of stronger watermarking methods.

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

### [173] [SpeedMalloc: Improving Multi-threaded Applications via a Lightweight Core for Memory Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20253)
*Ruihao Li,Qinzhe Wu,Krishna Kavi,Gayatri Mehta,Jonathan C. Beard,Neeraja J. Yadwadkar,Lizy K. John*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Memory allocation significantly impacts program performance in multi-threaded systems. SpeedMalloc, a support-core-based allocator, enhances performance by reducing cache conflicts and synchronization issues, achieving up to 1.75x speedup compared to existing allocators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory allocation, despite being a small part of code, has a significant performance impact due to complexities in multi-threaded systems, necessitating improvements in allocator efficiency.

Method: SpeedMalloc introduces a lightweight support-core that processes allocation tasks, stores metadata in its own cache, and reduces cross-core synchronization issues, leveraging general-purpose cores for flexibility.

Result: SpeedMalloc demonstrates speedups of 1.75x to 1.18x over leading memory allocators in multi-threaded workloads.

Conclusion: SpeedMalloc effectively enhances memory allocation performance by minimizing cache pollution and synchronization overhead, while allowing for flexible allocation design.

Abstract: Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed
code, can have a "butterfly effect" on overall program performance, leading to
significant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately
5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x
performance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from
the complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core
systems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading
to cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.
Offloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a
potential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache
pollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for
multi-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators
remains a significant challenge.
  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory
allocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a
lightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data
synchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This
design minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for
cross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core
instead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting
new allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software
and hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and
Memento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on
multithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.

*Arya Tschand,Muhammad Awad,Ryan Swann,Kesavan Ramakrishnan,Jeffrey Ma,Keith Lowery,Ganesh Dasika,Vijay Janapa Reddi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwizzlePerf, a framework that makes large language models hardware-aware to optimize GPU kernel performance, achieving significant speed and efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for hardware-aware optimization in GPU performance engineering, which human engineers traditionally achieve through expertise but which LLMs currently lack.

Method: SwizzlePerf provides explicit hardware-awareness to large language models by utilizing memory access patterns, architecture specifications, profiling logs, and prior performance data to generate tailored software-level optimizations.

Result: When applied to a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf generated optimal results in under 5 minutes, a task that took human engineers 2 weeks. Across 10 different kernels, SwizzlePerf achieved up to a 2.06x speedup and a 70% improvement in L2 cache hit rate in 9 of them.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that hardware-aware LLMs, like SwizzlePerf, can significantly enhance GPU kernel optimization in terms of both time and performance, paving the way for more systematic and efficient performance engineering methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM
performance engineering agents.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in latency-sensitive inference on shared A100 clusters caused by PCIe interference. The proposed controller improves performance by optimizing GPU configuration, placement, and management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce tail latency and SLO violations caused by neighbor interference in shared A100 machine clusters running latency-sensitive applications.

Method: The authors propose a host-level controller that dynamically configures MIG, optimizes PCIe-aware placement, and employs lightweight mechanisms like MPS quotas and cgroup I/O to control resource usage and avoid interference.

Result: Using both single-host and 16-GPU cluster setups, the method reduces SLO miss-rate by ~32%, improves p99 latency by ~15%, and incurs only ≤5% throughput cost. Evaluations show significant advantages for LLM serving as well.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively reduces latency and SLO violations in shared GPU clusters, combining reconfiguration, placement optimization, and resource management mechanisms efficiently.

Abstract: Latency-sensitive inference on shared A100 clusters often suffers
noisy-neighbor interference on the PCIe fabric, inflating tail latency and SLO
violations. We present a fabric-agnostic, VM-deployable host-level controller
that combines dynamic Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) reconfiguration, PCIe-aware
placement, and lightweight guardrails (MPS quotas, cgroup I/O). It samples
per-tenant tails and system signals, uses topology hints to avoid PCIe hot
spots, and gates actions with dwell/cool-down to avoid thrash. On a single host
and a 2-node (16-GPU) cluster, SLO miss-rate is reduced by \(\approx\)32\%
(\(\approx\)1.5) and p99 latency improves \(\approx\)15\% with \(\leq\)5\%
throughput cost versus static MIG and naive placement; ablations show MIG and
placement contribute comparably. We also evaluate LLM serving with vLLM on OLMo
2 7B Instruct: TTFT p99 improves \(\approx\)10--15\% at \(\leq\)5\% cost
without changing the controller.

*Guanyu Xu,Zhiwei Hao,Li Shen,Yong Luo,Fuhui Sun,Xiaoyan Wang,Han Hu,Yonggang Wen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CoFormer is a collaborative inference system enabling efficient and scalable deployment of transformer models on resource-constrained edge devices while mitigating latency, memory, and energy challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying computation-intensive transformer models on resource-constrained edge devices without excessive trade-offs between latency, accuracy, and efficiency.

Method: Proposes the CoFormer system, which decomposes large transformers into smaller distributed models for collaborative inference. Introduces the DeBo algorithm to optimize latency, accuracy, and performance calibration under hardware constraints.

Result: CoFormer achieves up to 3.1x inference speedup, reduces memory by 76.3%, and cuts energy consumption by ~40% for edge devices, even supporting large-scale models like GPT2-XL.

Conclusion: This method demonstrates the feasibility of deploying large and complex transformer models on heterogeneous edge hardware in a resource-efficient manner while ensuring competitive performance.

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

*Tiancheng Zhao,Zekun Yin,Huihai An,Xiaoyu Yang,Zhou Jin,Jiasi Shen,Helen Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Graph Spectral Sparsification (GSS) relies on obtaining sparse subgraphs for computational efficiency. The paper introduces a parallel algorithm, pdGRASS, to address inefficiencies in feGRASS, achieving speedups and scalable improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient computation in problems requiring graph spectral sparsification, overcoming challenges with feGRASS such as strict data dependencies and poor performance on skewed inputs.

Method: Development of pdGRASS, a parallel algorithm leveraging edge subtask decomposition for one-pass edge recovery eliminating strict data dependencies.

Result: pdGRASS demonstrates 3.9x to 8.8x average speedups, mitigates feGRASS's worst-case runtime with over 1000x improvement, and achieves varied iterations in PCG based on sparsifier edge recovery.

Conclusion: pdGRASS significantly enhances scalability, parallelization, and runtime performance for graph spectral sparsification while maintaining quality comparable to feGRASS.

Abstract: Graph Spectral Sparsification (GSS) identifies an ultra-sparse subgraph, or
sparsifier, whose Laplacian matrix closely approximates the spectral properties
of the original graph, enabling substantial reductions in computational
complexity for computationally intensive problems in scientific computing. The
state-of-the-art method for efficient GSS is feGRASS, consisting of two steps:
1) spanning tree generation and 2) off-tree edge recovery. However, feGRASS
suffers from two main issues: 1) difficulties in parallelizing the recovery
step for strict data dependencies, and 2) performance degradation on skewed
inputs, often requiring multiple passes to recover sufficient edges. To address
these challenges, we propose parallel density-aware Graph Spectral
Sparsification (pdGRASS), a parallel algorithm that organizes edges into
disjoint subtasks without data dependencies between them, enabling efficient
parallelization and sufficient edge recovery in a single pass. We empirically
evaluate feGRASS and pdGRASS based on 1) off-tree edge-recovery runtime and 2)
sparsifier quality, measured by the iteration count required for convergence in
a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) application. The evaluation
demonstrates that, depending on the number of edges recovered, pdGRASS achieves
average speedups ranging from 3.9x to 8.8x. The resulting sparsifiers also show
between 1.2x higher and 1.8x lower PCG iteration counts, with further
improvements as more edges are recovered. Additionally, pdGRASS mitigates the
worst-case runtimes of feGRASS with over 1000x speedup. These results highlight
pdGRASS's significant improvements in scalability and performance for the graph
spectral sparsification problem.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an intelligent optimization method using a multi-agent system for better governance in large-scale microservice architectures and demonstrates its superior performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses governance challenges in managing large-scale microservice architectures, such as service dependencies, dynamic structures, and fluctuating workloads.

Method: The method models services as agents using graph representation learning to capture system structure, employs Markov Decision Processes for policy learning, and integrates centralized training with decentralized execution. A game-driven policy optimization mechanism enhances adaptability.

Result: Experiments on a microservice simulation platform reveal improved coordination efficiency, adaptability, and policy convergence compared to alternative methods, demonstrating superior governance performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves operational stability and governance efficiency in microservice systems, offering practical and feasible solutions for real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent service optimization method based on a
multi-agent collaborative evolution mechanism to address governance challenges
in large-scale microservice architectures. These challenges include complex
service dependencies, dynamic topology structures, and fluctuating workloads.
The method models each service as an agent and introduces graph representation
learning to construct a service dependency graph. This enables agents to
perceive and embed structural changes within the system. Each agent learns its
policy based on a Markov Decision Process. A centralized training and
decentralized execution framework is used to integrate local autonomy with
global coordination. To enhance overall system performance and adaptability, a
game-driven policy optimization mechanism is designed. Through a
selection-mutation process, agent strategy distributions are dynamically
adjusted. This supports adaptive collaboration and behavioral evolution among
services. Under this mechanism, the system can quickly respond and achieve
stable policy convergence when facing scenarios such as sudden workload spikes,
topology reconfigurations, or resource conflicts. To evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a representative
microservice simulation platform. Comparative analyses are performed against
several advanced approaches, focusing on coordination efficiency, adaptability,
and policy convergence performance. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms others in several key metrics. It significantly improves
governance efficiency and operational stability in large-scale microservice
systems. The method demonstrates strong practical value and engineering
feasibility.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CrystalICL, a model for few-shot crystal generation, leveraging novel tokenization and tuning strategies to address limitations in previous LLM-based crystal design approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts design new materials by modifying known structures, aligning with few-shot learning. Current LLM-based methods fail to exploit this approach.

Method: The authors propose a space-group based crystal tokenization, a hybrid instruction tuning framework, and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy for effective few-shot learning.

Result: CrystalICL outperforms leading baselines in four crystal generation benchmarks for conditional and unconditional tasks.

Conclusion: CrystalICL demonstrates its potential by improving few-shot crystal generation, advancing the utility of LLMs in material design.

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

*Elisha Dayag,Nhat Thanh Van Tran,Jack Xin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based models excel in long time-series forecasting but face challenges like low-frequency bias and high resource requirements. This paper enhances such models by integrating learnable frequency filters, improving performance and reducing size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of low-frequency bias in transformer-based models and their high computational demands in long time-series forecasting.

Method: Introduced learnable frequency filters at the beginning of transformer-based models, adding approximately 1000 parameters.

Result: The enhanced models showed a 5-10% relative improvement in forecasting performance, along with decreased embedding dimensions and improved spectral utilization.

Conclusion: Learnable filters can both improve performance and reduce computational demands in transformer-based models, making them more effective for long time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

*Heng-Sheng Chang,Prashant G. Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper aims to connect the classical Wiener linear predictor to modern transformer models by interpreting transformer signals through probabilistic and fixed-point modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to bridge traditional nonlinear filtering methods with contemporary inference frameworks like transformers to enhance understanding and application.

Method: They propose a probabilistic model interpreting transformer layer operations as fixed-point updates, specifically demonstrated through hidden Markov models (HMMs).

Result: Transformers are framed as nonlinear predictors, and an explicit fixed-point update mechanism is derived for HMMs, providing insights into their operation.

Conclusion: The study establishes a conceptual link between classical and modern predictive methods, deepening theoretical understanding and opening avenues for further research in inference architectures.

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

*Johnson Zhou,Joseph West,Krista A. Ehinger,Zhenming Ren,Sam E. John,David B. Grayden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CTXSEG, an adaptive EEG signal segmentation method, showing its superiority over fixed-length approaches for seizure detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-length segmentation methods for EEG signals may lack biological relevance, motivating the need for adaptive segmentation methods.

Method: The paper proposes CTXSEG, a statistical-based adaptive segmentation method, and validates it on synthetic and real-world EEG seizure datasets.

Result: CTXSEG outperforms fixed-length segmentation in seizure detection without requiring modifications to machine learning models.

Conclusion: Adaptive segmentation techniques like CTXSEG can enhance EEG analysis workflows in machine learning and hold promise for broader adoption.

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how the teacher model's calibration impacts the student's performance in knowledge distillation, proposing that better teacher calibration improves the KD process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the factors driving effective Knowledge Distillation (KD) and explore how teacher model calibration affects student model performance.

Method: Analyzed the correlation between teacher calibration error and student accuracy, and employed calibration methods to improve teacher model's calibration error before KD.

Result: Teacher calibration error is strongly correlated with improved student accuracy, and applying calibration methods enhanced KD performance across different tasks and methods.

Conclusion: Improving the teacher model's calibration significantly boosts student model performance in KD, and the proposed approach integrates well with state-of-the-art methods to consistently achieve better results.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to evaluate various symbolic regression methods in discovering equations for complex dynamical systems, enhancing their applicability in diverse fields such as physics, ecology, and epidemiology.

Method: The authors tested five symbolic regression methods on nine dynamical processes, including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, focusing on evaluation through predictive power, accuracy, and comparability to original equations.

Result: The PySR method consistently demonstrated superior performance with high predictive power and accuracy, often producing results indistinguishable from the original analytical forms.

methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

### [185] [Coresets from Trajectories: Selecting Data via Correlation of Loss Differences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20230)
*Manish Nagaraj,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple, scalable, and efficient metric for selecting impactful training samples by analyzing their loss alignment with a validation set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art deep learning models face scalability challenges, especially for real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. There is a need to optimize training by efficiently selecting impactful subsets of data.

Method: The CLD method focuses on measuring the alignment of the loss differences of training samples with a validation set. It uses per-sample loss values at training checkpoints and avoids costly gradient or curvature computations. Theoretical guarantees of convergence error bounds are provided.

Result: On benchmarks like CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, CLD matches or outperforms many state-of-the-art methods with minimal computational overhead. It effectively transfers across architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet) and maintains stability with early checkpoints, demonstrating negligible accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: CLD offers a scalable, efficient, and transferable solution for dataset optimization. Its bias reduction, efficiency, and stability make it an ideal tool for coreset selection in deep learning.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

*Firooz Shahriari-Mehr,Javad Aliakbari,Alexandre Graell i Amat,Ashkan Panahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a spectral graph clustering optimization that integrates node-specific information, showing it improves transductive node classification in graphs with clear community-label alignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve transductive node classification leveraging the synergy between graph structure and node-specific information like labels and node features. Existing methods often neglect this combined approach.

Method: Introduce a novel spectral graph clustering optimization problem incorporating node-specific information and analyze its ability to recover communities under milder, practical conditions.

Result: The proposed framework guarantees perfect community recovery in scenarios with specific node information, outperforming traditional graph clustering bounds. Numerical experiments confirm this.

Conclusion: Integrating node-specific information into spectral graph clustering enhances community recovery in transductive node classification, offering better theoretical and experimental performance.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

### [187] [Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20333)
*Md Abdullah Al Mamun,Ihsen Alouani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that exploits the alignment mechanisms in large language models to inject bias and enforce censorship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to demonstrate the potential risks and vulnerabilities inherent in the alignment mechanisms of LLMs, particularly in scenarios where adversaries can manipulate them to promote biases or specific censorship.

Method: The authors propose a poisoning attack named Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI) that uses alignment mechanisms to trigger targeted refusal behaviors in LLMs. They also evaluate its evasion capabilities against state-of-the-art defenses.

Result: The attack bypassed current defenses and induced significant bias in downstream applications. For instance, in ChatDoctor, 1% data poisoning led to racially targeted refusals with a bias increase of 23%.

Conclusion: SAI showcases serious risks in the alignment mechanisms of LLMs, emphasizing the need for robust safeguards against such adversarial exploitation to ensure unbiased and safe AI applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

*Neta Shoham,Haim Avron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes algorithms for exact stochastic inference in Gaussian Processes (GPs) with finite reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), improving experimental results where resources are constrained.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome limitations of existing GP stochastic learning methods, which use biased approximations and often fail to converge to stationary points of true marginal likelihoods.

Method: Developing algorithms for exact stochastic inference in GPs using RKHS of moderate finite dimensions, with extensions to infinite RKHSs at the cost of precision.

Result: The approach provides better experimental outcomes as compared to traditional methods, particularly under conditions of constrained memory or batch size.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms address convergence and resource limitation challenges in stochastic GP inference, offering improved performance without heavy computational dependencies.

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

*Ralph Bulanadi,Jawad Chowdhury,Funakubo Hiroshi,Maxim Ziatdinov,Rama Vasudevan,Arpan Biswas,Yongtao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents INS2ANE, a framework to enhance novel discoveries in autonomous scientific experiments by focusing on novelty scoring and strategic exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous experiments mainly focus on optimizing predefined goals, limiting the discovery of unknown or unexpected phenomena. There is a need to enhance exploratory approaches to uncover novel phenomena in scientific research.

Method: INS2ANE incorporates a novelty scoring system to assess uniqueness and a strategic sampling mechanism to explore less-sampled regions, even if they seem less promising. This approach is tested on a pre-acquired dataset and applied to autonomous scanning probe microscopy experiments.

Result: INS2ANE significantly improved the diversity of explored phenomena compared to traditional optimization methods, increasing the likelihood of discovering new phenomena.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of autonomous experiments to enhance scientific discovery by promoting deeper exploration of experimental spaces, simultaneously achieving efficiency and uncovering novel insights.

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

*Debabrota Basu,Sourav Chakraborty,Debarshi Chanda,Buddha Dev Das,Arijit Ghosh,Arnab Ray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to assess whether sample surveys credibly represent the population, with an algorithm whose efficiency is independent of data dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical problem of verifying whether a sample survey reliably represents the population, especially when the challenge involves high-dimensional data for which traditional approaches are computationally expensive.

Method: The paper proposes a task-based model-specific distance metric and designs an algorithm to verify survey credibility in the context of regression models. The algorithm avoids reconstructing the regression model to maintain efficiency.

Result: The proposed algorithm is theoretically proven to be correct and demonstrates efficient performance numerically. It achieves credibility verification with sample complexity independent of data dimensionality.

Conclusion: Focusing on verification rather than model reconstruction simplifies the process, offering a dimensionally efficient approach to ensure survey data credibility for regression models.

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations of distributed online optimization algorithms, such as dependency on bounded gradient assumptions and lack of focus on stochastic gradients in dynamic directed networks.

Method: The TV-HSGT algorithm leverages hybrid stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms with row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes. It eliminates the need for Perron vector estimation and combines current and recursive gradients to reduce variance.

Result: Theoretical analysis demonstrates TV-HSGT's capacity for improved dynamic regret bounds. Experimental evaluations on logistic regression confirm its effectiveness in dynamic, resource-constrained setups.

Conclusion: TV-HSGT successfully addresses challenges of gradient boundedness and stochastic gradient tracking in time-varying directed networks, showing promise for applications in dynamic data environments.

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in non-convex optimization and interpretability in independent component analysis, particularly in scientific contexts where supervision data is available.

Method: The method integrates a proximal gradient-type algorithm for invertible matrices with simultaneous prediction model learning through backpropagation.

Result: Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show enhanced optimization success rates and better interpretability of independent components, attributed to the supervisory information.

Conclusion: The additional supervisory input strengthens non-convex optimization efforts and enables more interpretable analyses, making the approach effective for ICA in scientific applications.

Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that
incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific
contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of
invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real

observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining latent variable models with double machine learning to estimate causal effects in the presence of hidden factors, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of unobserved factors impacting causal inference in observational data, which can affect treatment and outcome estimations.

Method: The method integrates latent variable modeling into the second stage of the double machine learning framework, separating representation learning from latent variable inference. It examines two cases: when latent variables affect only the outcome, and when they impact both treatment and outcome.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: This new framework enhances causal effect estimation even when hidden factors are present, thereby improving robustness in causal inference.

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the theoretical advantages of tool-augmented language models over conventional ones, demonstrating that external tools enable unbounded factual recall compared to the limits of memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and prove the theoretical advantages of tool-augmented language models, especially for factual recall tasks, as compared to models relying solely on in-weight learning.

Method: The authors use theoretical proofs and controlled experiments to compare the memorization capacity of models with and without external tool-use. They also analyze the effectiveness of teaching tool-use versus fine-tuning model weights.

Result: Tool-using models are shown to outperform memorization-based models consistently, both theoretically and in controlled experiments. Teaching tool-use proves more efficient for pretrained large language models than embedding facts into memory.

Conclusion: The study establishes that tool-augmented workflows are not only practical but also provably more scalable for improving factual recall and model efficiency.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

TL;DR: The paper studies the theoretical convergence of subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) and its variant SPRING. It establishes equivalence with regularized Kaczmarz methods and offers new convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNGD has demonstrated practical success in machine learning applications, but lacked theoretical understanding. This paper addresses the gap by analyzing its convergence properties.

Method: The authors analyze linear parametric optimization problems with strongly convex quadratic loss functions, focusing on the case of least-squares loss. They utilize tools from randomized linear algebra.

Result: The paper provides the first fast convergence rate for SNGD and SPRING under mild conditions. It demonstrates that SPRING accelerates SNGD and generalizes SNGD analysis beyond least-squares loss.

Conclusion: This study bridges practical success and theoretical understanding of SNGD and SPRING using insights from randomized linear algebra, opening avenues for more robust optimization strategies.

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

Motivation: The study aims to explore how LLMs can address challenges in high-dimensional genetic data processing and improve diagnostics and education in the field.

Method: Conducting a systematic review through automated keyword-based searches in scientific databases, analyzing 172 relevant studies describing LLMs applications.

Result: LLMs have shown impactful applications in genomic variant analysis, medical imaging, and report generation but face challenges in multimodal data integration and clinical adaptability.

Conclusion: While LLMs advance hereditary disease diagnostics and education, their limitations emphasize the need for improved generalizability and robust clinical pipelines.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Motivation: Neural networks often face unpredictable local performance, affecting reliability in critical applications. The paper aims to address this issue by providing a measurable insight into local stability.

Method: The paper establishes the VC metric, explores its theoretical properties, and utilizes it to create a preprocessing framework. It also involves investigating two phenomena, VC-tendency and minority-tendency, during approximation tasks.

Result: VC metric reveals trends in neural network errors and improves preprocessing. Numerical and real-world experiments validate its effectiveness, particularly in PDE-related scientific problems.

Conclusion: The VC metric advances understanding of approximation behavior and stability, offering an effective preprocessing framework that enhances neural network performance.

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration

*Shihao Zhang,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Beacon, a tuning-free algorithm for per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) that automatically selects scaling factors and achieves competitive performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization is essential for reducing memory and computation costs in large pre-trained models, but existing approaches require manual tuning or grid search for scaling factors.

Method: Beacon is a tuning-free algorithm that determines optimal scaling factors automatically using the geometry of symmetric scalar quantization, and supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization without back-propagation or large calibration datasets.

Result: Beacon simplifies the quantization process and achieves competitive performance without the need for heuristic tuning or extensive calibration.

Conclusion: Beacon offers a practical and effective solution for efficient model deployment by eliminating manual tuning while retaining high quantization performance.

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

*Frank Röder,Jan Benad,Manfred Eppe,Pradeep Kr. Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DALI, a new framework that enhances Dreamer by using latent representations for better generalization in unseen reinforcement learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cMDP approaches rely on explicit context variables, which are often latent or difficult to measure, necessitating a method to handle latent contexts in adaptive environments.

Method: DALI integrates a self-supervised encoder within Dreamer to infer latent context representations through forward dynamics prediction, conditioning the world model and policy for better perception-control integration.

Result: DALI demonstrates significant improvements over context-unaware baselines and outperforms context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling zero-shot adaptation to new contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully infers and exploits latent contexts, achieving robust generalization in challenging cMDP tasks, backed by theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling

### [201] [FedReFT: Federated Representation Fine-Tuning with All-But-Me Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20295)
*Fatema Siddika,Md Anwar Hossen,J. Pablo Muñoz,Tanya Roosta,Anuj Sharma,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedReFT is a federated learning approach that adapts Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), using sparse intervention layers for parameter-efficient updates of hidden representations while proposing ABM aggregation for handling task heterogeneity and achieving superior results compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods struggle in federated learning due to client heterogeneity in data, model capabilities, and computational resources. Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), while effective in standalone settings, faces challenges in such distributed environments.

Method: The paper introduces FedReFT, which employs sparse intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly and introduces the All-But-Me (ABM) aggregation strategy. This aggregation ensures stable personalized learning by incorporating global updates creatively, mitigating semantic alignment issues caused by naive averaging.

Result: FedReFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in federated learning tasks, achieving 7x-15x higher parameter efficiency compared to LoRA-based approaches across a range of benchmarks including commonsense reasoning and GLUE tasks.

Conclusion: FedReFT is a promising alternative for federated learning scenarios, offering lightweight fine-tuning with robust semantic representation and achieving significant improvements in parameter efficiency and performance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

TL;DR: This paper surveys the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), focusing on coordination models, learning algorithms, key ITS domains, and practical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the complexities of urban mobility by exploring how MARL can enhance decision-making in ITS, enabling agents to balance individual and system-wide objectives.

Method: The study categorizes MARL approaches into various learning frameworks, reviews applications in ITS domains, and discusses simulation platforms and benchmarks to support experimentation.

Result: The paper provides a structured taxonomy of MARL methods, reviews practical applications in ITS, and identifies persistent challenges such as scalability, credit assignment, and sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: MARL presents significant potential for ITS innovation, but practical deployment requires overcoming core challenges like non-stationarity and communication constraints.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

### [203] [Multi-View Graph Convolution Network for Internal Talent Recommendation Based on Enterprise Emails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20328)
*Soo Hyun Kim,Jang-Hyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an innovative internal talent recommendation framework integrating task similarity (WHAT) and collaboration dynamics (HOW) using email data, achieving superior result metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional internal talent recommendation systems rely heavily on limited managerial perspectives, often disregarding eligible candidates due to structural limitations in the process.

Method: The study creates two independent graphs for task-related data (WHAT) and interaction data (HOW) from employee email communication. These are adaptively fused using a Dual Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism.

Result: The proposed model delivered a top Hit@100 performance of 40.9% and displayed high interpretability in learning job-specific fusion strategies for distinct job families.

Conclusion: The findings underscore a new, data-driven approach to internal talent discovery that optimally balances task-related and collaborative context, addressing traditional selection process limitations while offering actionable insights for varied job families.

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

*Zohair Shafi,Serdar Kadioglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forge is a pre-trained vector-quantized graph autoencoder for mixed-integer programming (MIP) that demonstrates scalability and versatility in optimizing combinatorial problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to solving combinatorial optimization problems lack scalability and generalization, requiring extensive training on individual tasks and problem distributions.

Method: Forge uses an unsupervised vector-quantized graph autoencoder trained on a diverse set of MIP instances without relying on their solutions, creating embeddings that serve various tasks with a single model.

Result: Forge embeddings effectively cluster unseen instances (unsupervised setting) and predict warm-start variables and integrality gaps across diverse problem distributions (supervised setting), enhancing solver performance.

Conclusion: Forge provides scalable and generalizable embeddings for MIP tasks, improving optimization and promoting research through open-sourced resources.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

### [205] [Dynamic Synthetic Controls vs. Panel-Aware Double Machine Learning for Geo-Level Marketing Impact Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20335)
*Sang Su Lee,Vineeth Loganathan,Vijay Raghavan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evaluated geo-marketing lift estimation methods using simulators, finding panel-DML methods outperform ASC models in robustness during complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of quantifying marketing lift in geo-level two-sided marketplaces, where existing methods like SCM struggle in complex scenarios.

Method: Created a simulator to mimic geo rollouts and compared seven estimators across multiple stress tests, focusing on ASC and panel-DML methods.

Result: Panel-DML methods exhibited reduced bias and better confidence interval coverage compared to ASC, especially in challenging nonlinear or external shock cases.

Conclusion: Advocate for tailored diagnostic frameworks prioritizing the strengths of panel-DML methods for accurate geo-level marketing analysis in complex situations.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

*Hancheng Min,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines how gradient flow (GF) induces incremental learning in symmetric matrix factorization, revealing sequential learning of singular values through time-scale separations influenced by initialization scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the incremental learning phenomenon observed in gradient flow when training overparameterized neural networks, especially under small initialization assumptions.

Method: The paper analyzes symmetric matrix factorization using a closed-form solution derived from solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation, focusing on time-scale separations in learning dynamics.

Result: The incremental learning behavior is shown to stem from time-scale separation dynamics that become prominent with smaller initialization scales, enabling low-rank matrix approximations.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the sequential learning in gradient flow and suggests directions for extending the analysis to asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DFAMS, a framework to improve federated knowledge retrieval by leveraging dynamic information flow for cross-domain ambiguous queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in federated retrieval systems that struggle with ambiguous and cross-domain queries, which reduce the effectiveness of large language models.

Method: Utilizing dynamic information flow to identify latent query intents and partition knowledge sources. Gradient signals and Shapley value-based attribution were used for intent recognition, paired with multi-prototype contrastive learning for semantic alignment.

Result: DFAMS performed better than existing methods, achieving improvements of up to 14.37% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in QA accuracy across benchmarks.

Conclusion: DFAMS proves effective in handling complex federated retrieval scenarios, aiding downstream tasks by improving query intent identification and document retrieval quality.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper develops a multimodal machine-learning (MMML) architecture to predict hood frame geometry performance efficiently, reducing the need for computationally expensive simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide designers with a faster and less setup-intensive method for evaluating hood frame geometry performance, especially during the concept design phase.

Method: Develop a MMML architecture that leverages multiple data modalities to predict performance metrics, aiming to achieve better results compared to single-modality approaches.

Result: The MMML model outperformed traditional single-modality models and showed strong generalization ability when tested on unseen frame geometries.

Conclusion: MMML has strong potential to supplement traditional simulation methods, particularly in the conceptual design phase, bridging gaps between machine learning and real-world engineering applications.

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BiListing, a method to combine text and image data into a unified representation for Airbnb listings using large-language and pretrained language-image models, showing significant improvement in search ranking and business outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve challenges in combining diverse unstructured data (like images and text) from Airbnb listings into a unified representation for better search ranking and recommendations.

Method: Proposed BiListing leverages large-language models and pretrained language-image models to create single embedding vectors per modality for listings, enabling advanced search and addressing problems like cold start.

Result: BiListing demonstrated 0.425% NDCB gain, was deployed in Airbnb's production system, and generated tens of millions in additional revenue.

Conclusion: BiListing effectively aligns and integrates unstructured data into a single representation, improving user experience through more efficient and accurate search functionality.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TF-TransUNet1D, a deep neural network for denoising ECG signals by integrating a U-Net encoder-decoder, Transformer encoder, and dual-domain loss for better diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of noise and artifacts compromising the diagnostic utility of ECG signals, crucial for cardiac digital twins.

Method: The TF-TransUNet1D combines a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder and employs a dual-domain loss (time and frequency domains) to optimize ECG signal fidelity and denoising robustness.

Result: The proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in SNR improvement and error metrics with a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9540.

Conclusion: TF-TransUNet1D is a high-precision ECG denoising model that enhances pre-processing for cardiac digital twins, supporting more accurate monitoring and personalized modeling.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TLinFormer, a novel linear attention mechanism that achieves linear complexity while maintaining exact attention scores for improved performance in long-sequence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern Transformers face complexity bottlenecks in long-sequence applications, necessitating efficient attention mechanisms without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: The authors reconfigure neuron connection patterns, leveraging first principles of connectionism, to design a linear attention architecture called TLinFormer.

Result: TLinFormer delivers significant improvements in inference latency, KV cache efficiency, memory footprint, and overall speedup compared to standard Transformers.

Conclusion: TLinFormer bridges the performance gap between efficient attention methods and standard attention, providing a scalable solution for long-sequence tasks.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

### [212] [Assessing local deformation and computing scalar curvature with nonlinear conformal regularization of decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20413)
*Benjamin Couéraud,Vikram Sunkara,Christof Schütte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel geometric regularization called nonlinear conformal regularization for decoding maps in deep neural networks to improve dimensionality reduction and latent space representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimensionality reduction aims to extract main factors explaining data, particularly crucial for high-dimensional datasets. Autoencoders are widely used but face challenges in capturing local variations and geometry of latent representations.

Method: The authors propose nonlinear conformal regularization for decoder maps in autoencoders. This method introduces a scalar field, the conformal factor, to quantify local deformations and enables computation of scalar curvature of learned manifolds.

Result: The method was implemented and tested on Swiss roll and CelebA datasets, showcasing its ability to quantify and visualize local deformations and curvature in latent-to-original data mappings.

Conclusion: Nonlinear conformal regularization enhances autoencoders by enabling geometric insights into latent space deformations, making it a valuable tool for dimensionality reduction in data analysis.

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

*Yaniv Hassidof,Tom Jurgenson,Kiril Solovey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Diffusion Tree (DiTree), a framework combining diffusion policies with sampling-based planners for efficient and safe kinodynamic motion planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the inefficiencies of sampling-based planners caused by uninformed action sampling and the limitations of learning-based methods that fail to generalize and ensure safety in robot motion planning.

Method: The method involves integrating diffusion policies as informed samplers within sampling-based planners to guide state-space search, blending the learning ability of DPs with the safety and completeness of SBPs.

Result: DiTree achieves runtimes comparable to diffusion policies alone and is 3x faster than classical sampling-based planners, while improving the average success rate in out-of-distribution scenarios by approximately 30%.

Conclusion: DiTree effectively combines learning-based approaches with classical planning methods to enhance performance, generalization, and safety in motion planning for robots.

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

### [214] [On Identifying Why and When Foundation Models Perform Well on Time-Series Forecasting Using Automated Explanations and Rating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20437)
*Michael Widener,Kausik Lakkaraju,John Aydin,Biplav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance and interpretability of time-series forecasting models across diverse domains, emphasizing the advantages and limitations of feature-engineered models versus foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in understanding the success, failure, and trustworthiness of time-series forecasting models, which have significant real-world consequences.

Method: It combines traditional explainable AI methods with Rating Driven Explanations to evaluate the interpretability and performance of four model types (ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos, and Llama) on diverse datasets spanning multiple domains.

Result: Feature-engineered models like Gradient Boosting outperform foundation models in volatile or sparse domains, while foundation models like Chronos excel in stable or trend-driven domains.

Conclusion: Feature-engineered models are more suitable for volatile domains where interpretability is crucial, whereas foundation models work better in stable domains with clear trends.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

### [215] [Uncovering the Spectral Bias in Diagonal State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20441)
*Ruben Solozabal,Velibor Bojkovic,Hilal AlQuabeh,Kentaro Inui,Martin Takáč*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores diagonal initialization schemes in state space models (SSMs), particularly in the discrete Fourier domain, proposing a method (S4D-DFouT) that achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand how diagonal state-space models (SSMs) can be parameterized and investigate their learning biases.

Method: Analyzing diagonal SSM initialization schemes from a frequency perspective and proposing S4D-DFouT, a diagonal initialization in the discrete Fourier domain.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark, including successful training on large datasets like PathX-256.

Conclusion: Diagonal initialization in the discrete Fourier domain shows great potential in scaling state space models and improving their performance on difficult benchmarks.

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

### [216] [Towards Mitigating Excessive Forgetting in LLM Unlearning via Entanglement-Aware Unlearning with Proxy Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20443)
*Zhihao Liu,Jian Lou,Yuke Hu,Xiaochen Li,Tailun Chen,Yitian Chen,Zhan Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces EAGLE-PC, a novel machine unlearning framework that effectively removes specific data while addressing under- and over-forgetting issues, with strong improvements in model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and ownership concerns by developing a method that allows selective data removal from language models without complete retraining.

Method: EAGLE-PC uses entanglement-awareness guided loss reweighting for targeted forgetting and a proxy constraint leveraging in-context learning for mitigating over-forgetting.

Result: EAGLE-PC achieves consistent improvements in the trade-off between forgetting and utility on benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, nearing the performance of full retraining.

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC provides a scalable, robust solution for machine unlearning, effectively balancing forgetting fidelity and model utility, and is compatible as a plug-and-play enhancement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate synthetic datasets generated with Differential Privacy (DP), showing current methods significantly degrade utility and fidelity under strict privacy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of privacy and regulatory barriers that limit the use of real-world data, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance.

Method: The authors created a unified benchmark considering domain-specific datasets, privacy budgets, pre-training, and various evaluation metrics. They tested state-of-the-art privacy-preserving generation methods.

Result: Their evaluation across five domain-specific datasets revealed significant loss in utility and fidelity for synthetic data, especially when adhering to strict privacy constraints.

Conclusion: The paper highlights limitations of current privacy-preserving synthetic data generation methods and emphasizes the need for advanced techniques and realistic, standardized evaluation approaches.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

### [218] [Structure-aware Hypergraph Transformer for Diagnosis Prediction in Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20500)
*Haiyan Wang,Ye Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework called Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) to address limitations of existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Electronic Health Records (EHR) by effectively modeling higher-order dependencies and enhancing representation power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN methods for EHR data analysis are unable to adequately capture higher-order dependencies inherent in clinical data and suffer from limited representation due to localized message-passing schemes.

Method: The paper proposes the SHGT framework combining a hypergraph structural encoder to model higher-order interactions, a Transformer architecture to process the hypergraph, and a customized loss function for hypergraph reconstruction.

Result: Experiments conducted on real-world EHR datasets show that the proposed SHGT model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in diagnosis prediction tasks.

Conclusion: SHGT effectively addresses limitations of existing GNN-based approaches for EHR data, providing improved predictive modeling by leveraging hypergraph structures and Transformer mechanisms.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

*Weihai Zhi,Jiayan Guo,Shangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedGR$^2$, a novel framework for improving Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine through automated data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality, expert-annotated data for medical vision-language models is rare, and current methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) face challenges in generalization and reward signal reliability.

Method: MedGR$^2$ develops a virtuous cycle combining a data generator and a reward model to continuously create high-quality medical data for SFT and RL.

Result: MedGR$^2$-produced data enables SFT to exceed baselines based on human-curated datasets and RL implementation achieves state-of-the-art generalization across modalities and tasks.

Conclusion: MedGR$^2$ transforms data scarcity into data generation, enabling effective RL-based learning and unlocking the potential for generalizable medical AI in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

performance indicators into a single consolidated criterion. This approach is
opposed to traditional methods of setting up a single metric and allows you to
achieve a balance between accuracy, ranking quality, variety of output and the

### [222] [MERIT: Maximum-normalized Element-wise Ratio for Language Model Large-batch Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20577)
*Yang Luo,Zangwei Zheng,Ziheng Qin,Zirui Zhu,Yong Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MERIT, a new optimizer for large-batch deep neural network training that resolves issues in previous optimizers by addressing the max attention logit and fine-grained trust ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation during large-batch training in language models caused by optimization challenges, particularly the max attention logit issue and inadequacies in existing optimizers like AdamW and LAMB.

Method: MERIT employs a max-norm-based trust ratio to effectively regulate max attention logits and introduces element-wise trust ratios for more refined weight updates. It is designed to address inefficiencies in existing optimizers during large-batch training.

Result: MERIT achieves excellent performance in large-batch training for GPT-2 models of various sizes, enabling batch sizes as large as 6k without performance loss compared to traditional batch sizes.

Conclusion: MERIT improves large-batch training by addressing critical issues in optimization, enhancing training stability, and enabling faster progress in large language model development.

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

### [223] [Local Virtual Nodes for Alleviating Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20597)
*Tuğrul Hasan Karabulut,İnci M. Baytaş*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) as a strategy to address over-squashing in graph neural networks without significantly altering the graph's global structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks face challenges like over-squashing due to bottlenecks in tasks with long-range dependencies, and existing remedies often disrupt the original graph's topology.

Method: The proposed approach involves adding trainable Local Virtual Nodes, positioned based on node centrality, to improve connectivity in bottleneck regions and facilitate distant node communication.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show LVNs enhance structural connectivity and substantially improve graph and node classification performance.

Conclusion: Local Virtual Nodes effectively mitigate over-squashing in graph neural networks while preserving the input graph's global structure.

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores using Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformers (ViT) for self-supervised learning on 1D ultrasound signals. It shows strong performance improvements over models trained from scratch and CNN baselines, especially with synthetic data pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in ultrasound signal analysis, including the scarcity of labeled data and highly task-specific signal processing, by leveraging scalable self-supervised methods like MAEs.

Method: The approach involves pre-training MAEs with ViT architectures on unlabeled synthetic ultrasound signals, with systematic variation of model size, patch size, and masking ratio, and evaluating their impact on downstream tasks like time-of-flight classification.

Result: Pre-trained models significantly outperform scratch-trained models and CNN baselines in downstream tasks, and synthetic pre-training shows better transferability to real-world data compared to solely using limited real datasets.

Conclusion: MAEs are a promising method for scalable, self-supervised learning in ultrasound signal analysis, offering robust performance and efficient transfer to real-world applications.

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Motivation: Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to process and reason over large-scale graph-structured data, despite being effective with multimodal and retrieval-augmented systems.

Method: The GDS agent integrates graph algorithms as tools along with pre/post-processing within a model context protocol (MCP) server, making it compatible with modern LLMs for graph reasoning tasks.

Result: The GDS agent successfully solves a wide range of graph-related tasks as demonstrated on a new benchmark, while detailed case studies reveal its strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: The GDS agent represents a significant step in improving graph-based reasoning for LLMs, but challenges remain, and further improvements are outlined in a future roadmap.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VarDiU, a method that improves one-step diffusion distillation by using a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound for unbiased gradient estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion distillation methods often use biased gradient estimations due to imperfect denoising score matching, leading to sub-optimal performance.

Method: The paper proposes VarDiU, which provides an unbiased gradient estimator and directly applies this approach to diffusion distillation.

Result: VarDiU outperforms existing methods like Diff-Instruct in terms of generation quality, and it enables more efficient and stable training for one-step diffusion distillation.

Conclusion: VarDiU offers a significant improvement in diffusion distillation through unbiased gradient estimation, leading to better results and training efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-composition-based framework to boost the efficiency and accuracy of neural operators, achieving SOTA performance and scalability for scientific machine learning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance neural operators for solving complex scientific problems efficiently and accurately by leveraging insights from numerical PDE methods and iterative procedures.

Method: They employ a self-composition strategy, repeatedly applying a single neural operator block to deepen the model progressively. An adaptive train-and-unroll approach is used to optimize training efficiency.

Result: The framework improves accuracy-scalability with model depth, delivers computational savings, achieves SOTA benchmarks, and proves effective for complex applications like high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is computationally efficient, accurate, and scalable, addressing challenges in large-scale scientific machine learning tasks and complex wave phenomena modeling.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

*Michael Hagmann,Michael Staniek,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the compositionality in clinical time series and its ability to create synthetic data that mimics real-world clinical measurements, aiding in data-scarce forecasting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of sparse and low-resource data settings in clinical time series forecasting by exploring meaningful physiological state transitions.

Method: Conceptualizing compositionality in data generation processes, reconstructing latent states and rules, and evaluating data synthesis using domain adaptation-based tests.

Result: Synthetic data generated using compositional models successfully mimics original data distributions and significantly improves predictive capabilities, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation.

Conclusion: Compositional synthesis is a promising approach for enhancing clinical time series forecasting in sparse-data scenarios and offers deeper insights into data generation processes.

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning (RL) can be more effectively used than supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for harmful fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), prompting the proposal of TokenBuncher as a defense mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the growing safety risks associated with the misuse of large language models, especially through RL-based methods.

Method: The researchers introduced TokenBuncher, a defense mechanism that suppresses model uncertainty via entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism.

Result: Experiments demonstrate TokenBuncher’s ability to robustly mitigate harmful fine-tuning via RL while maintaining benign task performance.

Conclusion: RL presents greater risks for harmful LLM fine-tuning compared to SFT, and TokenBuncher is proposed as an effective defense mechanism against this threat.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

*Shaocong Wang,Tong Liu,Ming Li,Minjing Yu,Yong-Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EEGDM, a self-supervised EEG representation learning method using a latent diffusion model to address challenges in generalization and semantic complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG representation learning methods struggle to generalize across tasks and fully capture semantic and complex patterns, especially with limited training data.

Method: EEGDM leverages a latent diffusion model for EEG signal generation, utilizing an encoder to distill EEG signals and their channel augmentations into compact representations for guiding the generative process.

Result: EEGDM demonstrated high-quality EEG signal reconstruction, robust representation learning, and competitive performance across multiple tasks, utilizing modest pre-training data.

Conclusion: EEGDM shows promise as a practical and generalizable self-supervised approach for EEG analysis and downstream tasks.

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

TL;DR: SAFEMax is a Machine Unlearning method for diffusion models, ensuring impermissible class-conditioned outputs revert to Gaussian noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and effective method for unlearning specific information in diffusion models without compromising overall model performance.

Method: SAFEMax utilizes entropy maximization in the early diffusion steps, where class-specific information is prominent, halting denoising for impermissible classes.

Result: Experiments show that SAFEMax is effective and achieves significant efficiency improvements in comparison to existing methods.

Conclusion: SAFEMax offers a promising approach for controlled Machine Unlearning in diffusion models, balancing retention and forgetting effectively.

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion
models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the
entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when
conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising
process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention
by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific
information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax
and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

*Anirudh Satheesh,Keenan Powell,Hua Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes cMALC-D, a framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) for creating better training curricula in Contextual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (cMARL), enhancing generalization and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to address the brittleness of existing MARL algorithms when deployed in the real world under complex, uncertain conditions. Current cMARL methods suffer from unstable proxy signals during training due to multi-agent dynamics and partial observability.

Method: The proposed cMALC-D incorporates LLMs to generate semantically meaningful training curricula and introduces a diversity-based context blending mechanism to prevent mode collapse and promote exploration by combining features from prior contexts.

Result: Experiments in traffic signal control scenarios demonstrate that cMALC-D outperforms existing curriculum learning methods in terms of generalization and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LLM-guided curricula and diversity-based context blending address key limitations in cMARL training, offering a robust approach to improving MARL performance under uncertain conditions.

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

*Yang Gao,Dongjie Wang,Scott Piersall,Ye Zhang,Liqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for automated feature transformation using a revised GPT model, achieving improved performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art methods for feature transformation rely on computationally heavy encoder-decoder structures, which limit scalability. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The framework has four steps: collecting transformation records, using a revised GPT to construct embedding spaces, applying gradient-ascent search, and reconstructing sequences autoregressively.

Result: Experimental results indicate the framework matches or outperforms traditional methods, with notable improvements in computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures hold significant promise for scalable and efficient feature transformation while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

*Zeyue Zhang,Lin Song,Erkang Bao,Xiaoling Lv,Xinyue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATM-GAD, a graph neural network-based model that utilizes temporal motifs and adaptive time windows for improved financial fraud detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in conventional machine learning models and existing graph-based detectors that fail to capture temporal patterns or account-specific anomalous intervals in fast-changing modern financial systems.

Method: ATM-GAD uses a Temporal Motif Extractor to condense transaction histories into meaningful motifs and employs dual-attention blocks (IntraA and InterA) to analyze them. Additionally, an Adaptive Time-Window Learner provides entity-specific time-slice observation for detecting bursts of anomalous behavior.

Result: The proposed model, ATM-GAD, outperforms seven existing anomaly detection baselines across four real-world datasets, identifying fraud patterns that prior methods missed.

Conclusion: The integration of temporal motifs and adaptive time windows demonstrates superior performance in financial fraud detection, paving the way for more granular and effective anomaly detection in dynamic financial systems.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

*Yijia Guo,Junqing Zhang,Y. -W. Peter Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning-based physical layer authentication method for IoT devices using channel state information, achieving improved performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless IoT systems face security challenges due to the broadcast nature of transmissions, necessitating robust authentication methods to tackle dynamic channel variations.

Method: The paper employs a CNN-based Siamese network for evaluating CSI pair similarities, using synthetic datasets derived from WLAN TGn channel models for training, and combines simulation with experimental evaluation.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated superior authentication results with generalization across scenarios, improving AUC by 0.03 compared to FCN-based models and by 0.06 compared to correlation-based benchmarks.

Conclusion: The deep learning-based authentication method is a practical, effective solution for dynamic IoT environments, addressing vulnerabilities in wireless communication authentication.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a curated dataset, LeMat-Traj, optimized for developing machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) by standardizing and harmonizing quantum mechanical trajectory data from multiple repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of MLIPs is hindered by fragmented quantum mechanical datasets that are expensive to produce and difficult to integrate due to inconsistent formatting and accessibility.

Method: LeMat-Traj was developed by aggregating over 120 million atomic configurations from sources like the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD, and standardizing them for wide accessibility. It also introduces a modular library, LeMaterial-Fetcher, for integrating datasets.

Result: Using LeMat-Traj to fine-tune MLIP models significantly reduced force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. The dataset incorporates both low-energy and high-energy configurations, optimizing for training accuracy and transferability.

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj, along with the open-source LeMaterial-Fetcher library, contributes to the development and reproducibility of MLIPs by resolving data fragmentation issues and improving model accuracy.

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

*Dmitry Eremeev,Gleb Bazhenov,Oleg Platonov,Artem Babenko,Liudmila Prokhorenkova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces G2T-FM, a graph foundation model leveraging TabPFNv2 for handling diverse graph features efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of handling diverse and arbitrary graph node features in graph foundation models, which has not been adequately addressed despite successes in text-attributed graphs.

Method: The model augments node features with neighborhood feature aggregation, includes structural embeddings, and uses TabPFNv2 to construct node representations for graph tasks.

Result: G2T-FM outperforms existing GFMs and performs comparably to well-tuned GNNs in an in-context setting; after fine-tuning, it surpasses these GNN baselines.

Conclusion: G2T-FM demonstrates a novel and effective way to utilize tabular foundation models for graph machine learning, suggesting a new direction for advancements in this domain.

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework for sequential resource allocation with dynamic intervention effects, achieving improved program outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and addressing the dynamic and nonstationary nature of intervention effects in real-world settings, such as community health and digital advertising.

Method: The introduction of a framework within combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature that accounts for nonstationary rewards, with algorithms designed to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: The developed algorithms demonstrated improved performance in program enrollment during a diabetes intervention case study, with up to three times better outcomes than baseline methods.

Conclusion: The framework offers significant theoretical and practical contributions, enabling adaptive learning approaches to address behavioral change challenges effectively.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

*Souradeep Nanda,Anay Majee,Rishabh Iyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces InSQuAD, a model designed to improve In-Context Learning by incorporating Submodular Mutual Information to ensure quality and diversity in selected exemplars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval models for In-Context Learning often overlook diversity during query selection, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors propose a selection strategy using Submodular Mutual Information and a novel combinatorial training approach with a likelihood-based loss to enforce quality and diversity in retrieval. They also generate synthetic paraphrases to augment a dataset.

Result: InSQuAD significantly improves performance on nine benchmark datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing retrieval and selection for In-Context Learning.

Conclusion: InSQuAD's integration of quality and diversity into exemplar selection represents a robust advancement for improving In-Context Learning models.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

*Luozhijie Jin,Zijie Qiu,Jie Liu,Zijie Diao,Lifeng Qiao,Ning Ding,Alex Lamb,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), a new method for improving and flexibly controlling the alignment of diffusion-based generative models at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although diffusion-based generative models are successful, they face challenges in aligning their outputs with complex downstream objectives like human preferences and compositional accuracy. Existing reinforcement learning fine-tuning methods for these models are limited in performance and flexibility.

Method: The authors reinterpret reinforcement learning fine-tuning for diffusion models via stochastic differential equations and implicit reward conditioning. They then propose RLG, which modifies Classifier-Free Guidance by geometrically averaging outputs from base and fine-tuned models. This allows the adjustment of alignment strength dynamically at inference time.

Result: Experimental results show that RLG improves performance across various architectures, RL algorithms, and tasks, such as aligning to human preferences, compositional accuracy, and text rendering. Its support for interpolation and extrapolation also enhances flexibility in generative model alignment.

Conclusion: RLG is a practical and theoretically grounded approach for enhancing and adjusting alignment in diffusion models, offering better model control at inference time. The technique is supported by publicly available code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations in existing Machine Unlearning approaches, which often require costly retraining processes, making them impractical for large-scale datasets.

Method: It involves smoothing model prediction probabilities to an information-theoretic bound, reducing overconfidence from data memorization.

Result: LoTUS surpasses eight baseline methods in effectiveness and efficiency across five datasets, including ImageNet1k, under simulated real-world conditions.

Conclusion: LoTUS establishes itself as a superior alternative for MU, providing practical tools like RF-JSD for evaluation under realistic conditions without the need for retraining.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from
scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an
information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that

sensor data to electrical stimulation patterns, enabling neural organoids to
perform an open-loop artificial tactile Braille classification task. Human
forebrain organoids cultured on a low-density microelectrode array (MEA) are
systematically stimulated to characterize the relationship between electrical
stimulation parameters (number of pulse, phase amplitude, phase duration, and
trigger delay) and organoid responses, measured as spike activity and spatial
displacement of the center of activity. Implemented on event-based tactile
inputs recorded from the Evetac sensor, our system achieved an average Braille
letter classification accuracy of 61 percent with a single organoid, which
increased significantly to 83 percent when responses from a three-organoid
ensemble were combined. Additionally, the multi-organoid configuration
demonstrated enhanced robustness against various types of artificially
introduced noise. This research demonstrates the potential of organoids as
low-power, adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements and provides a
foundational encoding framework for future scalable bio-hybrid computing
architectures.

*Ruiyang Xu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces POS2FS, an enhanced framework using PSO to address uncertainties in feature-label correlations in streaming data, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the challenges in online streaming feature selection involving incomplete data and uncertain feature-label correlations, which hinder practical deployments.

Method: POS2FS integrates particle swarm optimization for feature-label relationship supervision and employs three-way decision theory to address fuzziness in feature selection, aiming to optimize robustness.

Result: Experiments on six real-world datasets show that POS2FS achieves higher accuracy than existing OSFS and OS2FS methods, showcasing superior feature subset selection capabilities.

Conclusion: POS2FS effectively reduces uncertainties in feature correlations and delivers enhanced performance in sparse streaming feature selection tasks, proving its potential for real-world high-dimensional data applications.

Abstract: In real-world applications involving high-dimensional streaming data, online
streaming feature selection (OSFS) is widely adopted. Yet, practical
deployments frequently face data incompleteness due to sensor failures or
technical constraints. While online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS)
mitigates this issue via latent factor analysis-based imputation, existing
methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to
inflexible models and degraded performance. To address these gaps, this work
proposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection
framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach
introduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label
relationships; 2) Three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in
supervised learning. Rigorous testing on six real-world datasets confirms
POS2FS outperforms conventional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, delivering higher
accuracy through more robust feature subset selection.

### [246] [Spatio-Temporal Pruning for Compressed Spiking Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20122)
*Yi Jiang,Malyaban Bal,Brian Matejek,Susmit Jha,Adam Cobb,Abhronil Sengupta*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking Neural Network-based Large Language Models (LLMs) aimed at improving computational efficiency and reducing inference latency while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs in energy-constrained environments is challenging due to their large model sizes and high inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks offer a brain-inspired, energy-efficient alternative to tackle these limitations.

Method: The authors introduce a spatio-temporal pruning framework that reduces active neurons and attention heads (spatial pruning), as well as dynamically adjusts the number of timesteps for different layers (temporal pruning). They further combine these methods with extreme quantization and knowledge distillation.

Result: Evaluation using SpikingBERT on the GLUE benchmark demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves significant reductions in computational operations and inference latency for power-constrained applications.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is effective for enabling real-time and energy-efficient natural language processing, making Spiking LLMs viable for edge device deployment and power-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in
energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high
inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse
event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in
the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing.
Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced
capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs.
This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here,
we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and
propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize
computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning
technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively
lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning
minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps
required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other
compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs
to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and
knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our
proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark
demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations
and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time,
low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more
practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.

### [247] [Solvable Tuple Patterns and Their Applications to Program Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20365)
*Naoki Kobayashi,Ryosuke Sato,Ayumi Shinohara,Ryo Yoshinaka*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Solvable Tuple Patterns (STPs) as an efficient way to express invariants in programs with list-like recursive data structures, enhancing automated verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated verification of programs manipulating recursive data structures remains challenging due to the complexity of expressing and inferring invariants.

Method: The authors propose STPs, which require only positive samples for inference, and integrate STP inference into a CHC solver for list-like data structures.

Result: The STP-enhanced CHC solver outperformed competitors, winning the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 with a significant margin.

Conclusion: The integration of STP inference into CHC solvers provides a practical and competitive solution for automated verification of programs with recursive data structures.

Abstract: Despite the recent progress of automated program verification techniques,
fully automated verification of programs manipulating recursive data structures
remains a challenge. We introduce the notion of solvable tuple patterns (STPs)
to express invariants between list-like recursive data structures. A
distinguishing feature of STPs is that they can be efficiently inferred from
only a small number of positive samples; no negative samples are required. An
SMT solver that supports the sequence theory can be used to check that an
inferred STP is indeed an inductive invariant. After presenting basic
properties of STPs and an STP inference algorithm, we show how to incorporate
the STP inference into a CHC (Constrained Horn Clauses) solver supporting
list-like data structures, which serves as a uniform backend for automated
program verification tools. A CHC solver incorporating the STP inference has
won the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 by a big margin.

### [248] [Static Factorisation of Probabilistic Programs With User-Labelled Sample Statements and While Loops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20922)
*Markus Böck,Jürgen Cito*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper explores how probabilistic programs with features like loops and dynamic labels can be represented graphically and uses this to optimize inference techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the open question of whether probabilistic programs with loops and dynamic labels can be represented as graphical models, a concept that remains unclear despite the established link between Bayesian networks and probabilistic programs.

Method: The authors extend operational semantics to support advanced language features, define a static analysis by translating programs into control-flow graphs, and develop a program slicing technique to enable optimizations.

Result: They identify a graphical representation for programs with complex features, offer a static factorization for program density, and demonstrate the efficacy of their optimization techniques for variational inference, Metropolis Hastings, and sequential Monte Carlo.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel approach to graphically represent complex probabilistic programs, enabling performance improvements in common inference methods and contributing to the broader understanding of these programs.

Abstract: It is commonly known that any Bayesian network can be implemented as a
probabilistic program, but the reverse direction is not so clear. In this work,
we address the open question to what extent a probabilistic program with
user-labelled sample statements and while loops - features found in languages
like Gen, Turing, and Pyro - can be represented graphically. To this end, we
extend existing operational semantics to support these language features. By
translating a program to its control-flow graph, we define a sound static
analysis that approximates the dependency structure of the random variables in
the program. As a result, we obtain a static factorisation of the implicitly
defined program density, which is equivalent to the known Bayesian network
factorisation for programs without loops and constant labels, but constitutes a
novel graphical representation for programs that define an unbounded number of
random variables via loops or dynamic labels. We further develop a sound
program slicing technique to leverage this structure to statically enable three
well-known optimisations for the considered program class: we reduce the
variance of gradient estimates in variational inference and we speed up both
single-site Metropolis Hastings and sequential Monte Carlo. These optimisations
are proven correct and empirically shown to match or outperform existing
techniques.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a tool-aware collision avoidance system for collaborative robots in dynamic environments, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency, accuracy, and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety and efficiency of collaborative robots in dynamic human environments is challenging due to changes in obstacle motion and tasks, compounded by limitations in current controllers assuming full visibility and fixed tools.

Method: The system uses a learned perception model to filter point cloud data, reason about occluded areas, predict collisions under partial observability, and employs constrained reinforcement learning to enable real-time smooth avoidance maneuvers.

Result: The proposed approach surpasses traditional methods like APF and MPPI in dynamic environments, achieving sub-millimeter accuracy and reducing computational cost by approximately 60%.

Conclusion: The approach offers a modular, efficient, and effective solution for collision avoidance, demonstrating practical integration into collaborative robot applications for safe real-world operation.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in human
environments is challenging, especially in dynamic settings where both obstacle
motion and tasks change over time. Current robot controllers typically assume
full visibility and fixed tools, which can lead to collisions or overly
conservative behavior. In our work, we introduce a tool-aware collision
avoidance system that adjusts in real time to different tool sizes and modes of
tool-environment interaction. Using a learned perception model, our system
filters out robot and tool components from the point cloud, reasons about
occluded area, and predicts collision under partial observability. We then use
a control policy trained via constrained reinforcement learning to produce
smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 milliseconds. In simulated and
real-world tests, our approach outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPPI)
in dynamic environments, while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. Moreover,
our system operates with approximately 60% lower computational cost compared to
a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner. Our approach provides modular, efficient,
and effective collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic environments.
We integrate our method into a collaborative robot application and demonstrate
its practical use for safe and responsive operation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPGrasp is a framework for real-time, dynamic grasp synthesis. It achieves low-latency operation ($<$73.1 ms) and high accuracy ($>$90%) by integrating user prompts with spatiotemporal context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for dynamic object grasp synthesis fail to achieve low latency while being promptable. This paper aims to resolve this trade-off for real-time applications.

Method: The proposed SPGrasp framework extends SAMv2 by incorporating user prompts with spatiotemporal context to achieve real-time grasp estimation on video streams.

Result: SPGrasp achieves benchmark accuracies of 90.6% (OCID), 93.8% (Jacquard), and 92.0% (GraspNet-1Billion) with per-frame latencies between 59 ms and 73.1 ms. Real-world experiments showed a 94.8% grasping success rate.

Conclusion: SPGrasp successfully addresses the latency-interactivity trade-off, offering accurate and real-time grasp synthesis for dynamic objects.

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in
interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively
resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for leveraging shear data in tactile robotics without explicit shear simulation, achieving significant accuracy in tactile control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simulating and utilizing shear dynamics for tasks involving dynamic object interactions in tactile control.

Method: The authors developed SimShear, which integrates a GAN-based method, shPix2pix, to transform simulated tactile images and shear-related vectors into realistic tactile visuals, facilitating two robotic arm tasks.

Result: The method achieved high accuracy in tactile tracking and collaborative tasks, maintaining contact errors within 1-2 mm, surpassing baseline models.

Conclusion: SimShear showcases that sim-to-real modeling of shear data is feasible with rigid-body simulators, advancing tactile robotics applications.

Abstract: We present SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that enables
the use of shear information without explicitly modeling shear dynamics in
simulation. Shear, arising from lateral movements across contact surfaces, is
critical for tasks involving dynamic object interactions but remains
challenging to simulate. To address this, we introduce shPix2pix, a
shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that transforms simulated tactile images absent of
shear, together with a vector encoding shear information, into realistic
equivalents with shear deformations. This method outperforms baseline pix2pix
approaches in simulating tactile images and in pose/shear prediction. We apply
SimShear to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms
equipped with a vision-based tactile sensor: (i) a tactile tracking task, where
a follower arm tracks a surface moved by a leader arm, and (ii) a collaborative
co-lifting task, where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader
follows a prescribed trajectory. Our method maintains contact errors within 1
to 2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is essential, validating
the feasibility of sim-to-real shear modeling with rigid-body simulators and
opening new directions for simulation in tactile robotics.

### [252] [Traversing the Narrow Path: A Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning Framework for Humanoid Beam Walking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20661)
*TianChen Huang,Wei Gao,Runchen Xu,Shiwu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for humanoids to traverse narrow beams using a two-stage system combining a footstep template and a residual planner for balance and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the difficulties humanoid robots face when crossing narrow beams due to safety-critical contact points and limitations of purely learned policies.

Method: A two-stage system is proposed: Stage-1 trains a tracker to robustly follow footstep targets on flat ground with random perturbations. Stage-2 trains a high-level planner in simulation to refine footstep placement for narrow beam traversal, using minimal sensing inputs to ensure interpretability and sim-to-real transfer.

Result: The framework enables reliable traversal of narrow beams, with improved success rate, adherence to the centerline, and safety margins compared to baselines. It was validated on a Unitree G1 robot in both simulation and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: This structured two-stage approach effectively balances safety, precision, and interpretability, demonstrating robust performance and efficient transfer from simulation to reality.

Abstract: Traversing narrow beams is challenging for humanoids due to sparse,
safety-critical contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies. We
propose a physically grounded, two-stage framework that couples an XCoM/LIPM
footstep template with a lightweight residual planner and a simple low-level
tracker. Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly
follow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic
footsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable
contact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in
simulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual
(Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template
step to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while
preserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and
consistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact,
forward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a
Unitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. Across
simulation and real-world studies, residual refinement consistently outperforms
template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence,
and safety margins, while the structured footstep interface enables transparent
analysis and low-friction sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed framework ensures both spatial precision and visual fidelity, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness in high-risk industrial environments.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the global decline in skilled workers by improving methods for skill transfer from humans to robots through imitation learning and motion-copying systems.

Method: The authors propose a flexible motion translation method using Generative Adversarial Networks to replicate human position and force data for task adaptability.

Result: Evaluation was conducted with a 3-DOF calligraphy robot, demonstrating the system’s effectiveness in task adaptation based on human input.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the proposed GAN-based method successfully enhances imitation learning for robots, allowing flexibility and task adaptability based on human instructions.

Abstract: Decreasing skilled workers is a very serious problem in the world. To deal
with this problem, the skill transfer from experts to robots has been
researched. These methods which teach robots by human motion are called
imitation learning. Experts' skills generally appear in not only position data,
but also force data. Thus, position and force data need to be saved and
reproduced. To realize this, a lot of research has been conducted in the
framework of a motion-copying system. Recent research uses machine learning
methods to generate motion commands. However, most of them could not change
tasks by following human intention. Some of them can change tasks by
conditional training, but the labels are limited. Thus, we propose the flexible
motion translation method by using Generative Adversarial Networks. The
proposed method enables users to teach robots tasks by inputting data, and
skills by a trained model. We evaluated the proposed system with a 3-DOF
calligraphy robot.

*Lorenzo Busellato,Federico Cunico,Diego Dall'Alba,Marco Emporio,Andrea Giachetti,Riccardo Muradore,Marco Cristani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs) to enhance fluid and safe Human-Robot Interaction by integrating probabilistic human motion prediction with formal safety guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative robotic setups face challenges reconciling safety with responsive behavior due to stochastic human motion variability. Traditional methods result in over-conservatism, limiting interaction fluidity.

Method: The authors propose UA-PCBFs, which fuse probabilistic human motion forecasting with Control Barrier Functions, enabling dynamic adjustments of safety margins based on human motion uncertainty.

Result: Real-world experiments validate UA-PCBFs, showing improvements in safety, usability, and human confidence while reducing safe space violations compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: UA-PCBFs provide a structured, uncertainty-aware framework that improves safety and fluidity in Human-Robot Interaction, addressing critical limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and
robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent
safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A
dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:
when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake
unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true
Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion
prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case
scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a
well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,
limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control
Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic
human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control
Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for
dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty
estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,
UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future
human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through
informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world
experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to
perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot
interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).
Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better
performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of
violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the
state-of-the-art.

enhances cooling efficiency with minimal force reduction. Experimental
validation conducted with two different user studies shows high temperature
identification accuracy (0.98 overall) across three thermal levels, and
significant manipulation improvements in a virtual pick-and-place tasks.

restricted to 1D, confirm the premise of introducing ESC as a natural control

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM), a framework to improve video-based embodied world modeling by focusing on short-horizon video generation and modular planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity and complexity of embodied interaction data limit the alignment between language and actions and pose challenges to scaling video-generation-based embodied world models.

Method: The proposed PEWM restricts video generation to fixed short horizons and integrates a modular Vision-Language Model planner and Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism to improve alignment, efficiency, and generalization.

Result: The PEWM approach enhances fine-grained alignment between language and action, reduces learning complexity, improves data efficiency, decreases inference latency, and supports compositional generalization for complex tasks.

Conclusion: PEWM bridges the gap between physical interaction and high-level reasoning, fostering scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing
attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a
key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality
of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language
and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video
generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the
embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data
far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on
this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive
Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short
horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic
concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning
complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)
decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model
(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further
enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization
of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework
leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic
awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction
and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and
general-purpose embodied intelligence.

### [260] [Genetic Informed Trees (GIT*): Path Planning via Reinforced Genetic Programming Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20871)
*Liding Zhang,Kuanqi Cai,Zhenshan Bing,Chaoqun Wang,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Genetic Informed Trees (GIT*), an improved path planning framework that better utilizes environmental data and integrates reinforced genetic programming for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current path planning methods that do not fully utilize available environmental data and oversimplify heuristic functions, reducing efficiency and solution quality.

Method: The study proposes GIT*, which builds on Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), integrating environmental data such as obstacle forces and vertex importance and incorporates reinforced genetic programming to evolve better generative heuristic functions.

Result: GIT* demonstrated superior computational efficiency and solution quality compared to existing planners, performing well in high-dimensional problems (R^4 to R^16) and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: GIT* effectively improves the efficiency and accuracy of optimal path planning by leveraging advanced environmental data and adaptive heuristic function generation.

Abstract: Optimal path planning involves finding a feasible state sequence between a
start and a goal that optimizes an objective. This process relies on heuristic
functions to guide the search direction. While a robust function can improve
search efficiency and solution quality, current methods often overlook
available environmental data and simplify the function structure due to the
complexity of information relationships. This study introduces Genetic Informed
Trees (GIT*), which improves upon Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) by integrating a
wider array of environmental data, such as repulsive forces from obstacles and
the dynamic importance of vertices, to refine heuristic functions for better
guidance. Furthermore, we integrated reinforced genetic programming (RGP),
which combines genetic programming with reward system feedback to mutate
genotype-generative heuristic functions for GIT*. RGP leverages a multitude of
data types, thereby improving computational efficiency and solution quality
within a set timeframe. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GIT* surpasses
existing single-query, sampling-based planners in problems ranging from R^4 to
R^16 and was tested on a real-world mobile manipulation task. A video

*Liding Zhang,Qiyang Zong,Yu Zhang,Zhenshan Bing,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a novel motion planning method that adapts parameters dynamically based on obstacle distributions, leading to faster convergence and improved solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion planning approaches lack adaptability to varying environmental configurations, preventing optimal performance in different obstacle densities.

Method: The paper introduces LIT*, a sampling-based deep fuzzy learning algorithm to adjust batch size and nearest neighbor parameters dynamically. It analyzes global and local obstacle density using valid and invalid state ratios.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate LIT* improves computation time and path quality in high-dimensional spaces (R^8 to R^14), outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LIT* is an adaptive motion planner that enhances efficiency and solution quality, validated successfully on high-dimensional tasks and robotic applications.

Abstract: Efficient motion planning algorithms are essential in robotics. Optimizing
essential parameters, such as batch size and nearest neighbor selection in
sampling-based methods, can enhance performance in the planning process.
However, existing approaches often lack environmental adaptability. Inspired by
the method of the deep fuzzy neural networks, this work introduces
Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a sampling-based deep fuzzy
learning-based planner that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor
parameters to obstacle distributions in the configuration spaces. By encoding
both global and local ratios via valid and invalid states, LIT* differentiates
between obstacle-sparse and obstacle-dense regions, leading to lower-cost paths
and reduced computation time. Experimental results in high-dimensional spaces
demonstrate that LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution
quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-query, sampling-based planners
in environments ranging from R^8 to R^14 and is successfully validated on a
dual-arm robot manipulation task. A video showcasing our experimental results

### [262] [CoCoL: A Communication Efficient Decentralized Collaborative Method for Multi-Robot Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20898)
*Jiaxi Huang,Yan Huang,Yixian Zhao,Wenchao Meng,Jinming Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoCoL, a decentralized collaborative learning method for multi-robot systems, which achieves communication efficiency, computation cost reduction, and robustness against data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot tasks face challenges like high communication overhead and data heterogeneity during collaborative learning. The authors aim to address these issues.

Method: CoCoL employs a mirror descent framework with approximate Newton updates for communication efficiency, inexact subproblem solutions to reduce computational costs, and integrates a gradient tracking scheme to handle data heterogeneity.

Result: Experiments show CoCoL reduces communication rounds and bandwidth consumption significantly while maintaining accuracy, even in scenarios with non-IID data, streaming data, and changing network topologies.

Conclusion: CoCoL delivers efficient and robust decentralized collaborative learning for multi-robot systems, addressing major challenges in communication and data diversity.

Abstract: Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of
multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to
high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot
tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized
Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL
achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type
updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and
reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore,
the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against
data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot
collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in
significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total
bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These
benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming
data, and time-varying network topologies.

### [263] [Language-Enhanced Mobile Manipulation for Efficient Object Search in Indoor Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20899)
*Liding Zhang,Zeqi Li,Kuanqi Cai,Qian Huang,Zhenshan Bing,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a new hierarchical framework called GODHS that combines language models and heuristic-guided navigation to improve robots' efficiency in object search within complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to identify and locate objects in unstructured environments more efficiently, overcoming the limitations of traditional static scene representations and semantic reasoning.

Method: The proposed method, GODHS, integrates large language models for semantic and spatial reasoning with a hierarchical search process. It uses structured prompts and logical constraints for reliable reasoning, along with a heuristic motion planner for efficient exploration.

Result: Experiments conducted in Isaac Sim demonstrated that GODHS significantly enhances search efficiency compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: GODHS effectively combines semantic perception and systematic navigation, making it a viable solution for robotic object search in complex settings.

Abstract: Enabling robots to efficiently search for and identify objects in complex,
unstructured environments is critical for diverse applications ranging from
household assistance to industrial automation. However, traditional scene
representations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable
contextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in
completely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a
language-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates
semantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented
Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large
language models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process
through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved
through the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each
stage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we
introduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting
with distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths.
Comprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search
efficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies. Website

TL;DR: PLUME is a procedural generation framework for creating diverse 3D underground environments, beneficial for space exploration applications such as AI training and robotics evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the advancement of space exploration, there is a growing need for realistic underground simulations to study environments suitable for shelter, resources, and scientific research.

Method: The authors developed PLUME, a flexible and procedural 3D underground environment generator, facilitating enhancements and accuracy to match evolving solar system understanding.

Result: PLUME was successfully integrated with a robotic simulator for testing and research purposes, and the framework was made publicly available as open-source on GitHub.

Conclusion: PLUME proved to be a valuable tool for advancing robotic and algorithmic exploration capabilities in simulated underground environments.

Abstract: As space exploration advances, underground environments are becoming
increasingly attractive due to their potential to provide shelter, easier
access to resources, and enhanced scientific opportunities. Although such
environments exist on Earth, they are often not easily accessible and do not
accurately represent the diversity of underground environments found throughout
the solar system. This paper presents PLUME, a procedural generation framework
aimed at easily creating 3D underground environments. Its flexible structure
allows for the continuous enhancement of various underground features, aligning
with our expanding understanding of the solar system. The environments
generated using PLUME can be used for AI training, evaluating robotics
algorithms, 3D rendering, and facilitating rapid iteration on developed
exploration algorithms. In this paper, it is demonstrated that PLUME has been
used along with a robotic simulator. PLUME is open source and has been released
on Github. https://github.com/Gabryss/P.L.U.M.E

### [265] [Scaling Fabric-Based Piezoresistive Sensor Arrays for Whole-Body Tactile Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20959)
*Curtis C. Johnson,Daniel Webb,David Hill,Marc D. Killpack*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in tactile sensing for whole-body robotic manipulation by introducing an advanced system with fabric-based sensors and a daisy-chained SPI bus topology, enabling real-time tactile feedback for improved robot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of wiring complexity, data throughput, and system reliability in scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body robotic manipulation.

Method: The proposed system combines fabric-based sensors with custom readout electronics to mitigate signal crosstalk and employs a daisy-chained SPI bus topology to replace wireless protocols and USB hubs. It enables synchronized sensing from a large number of taxels with high update rates.

Result: The system streams data from over 8,000 taxels across 1 square meter at over 50 FPS and demonstrates effectiveness in a robot control task, enabling the transition from forceful, damaging motions to gentle, controlled grasps.

Conclusion: The architecture provides a robust platform for real-time tactile feedback, paving the way for advanced research in whole-body robotic control and human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is a significant
challenge, often limited by wiring complexity, data throughput, and system
reliability. This paper presents a complete architecture designed to overcome
these barriers. Our approach pairs open-source, fabric-based sensors with
custom readout electronics that reduce signal crosstalk to less than 3.3%
through hardware-based mitigation. Critically, we introduce a novel,
daisy-chained SPI bus topology that avoids the practical limitations of common
wireless protocols and the prohibitive wiring complexity of USB hub-based
systems. This architecture streams synchronized data from over 8,000 taxels
across 1 square meter of sensing area at update rates exceeding 50 FPS,
confirming its suitability for real-time control. We validate the system's
efficacy in a whole-body grasping task where, without feedback, the robot's
open-loop trajectory results in an uncontrolled application of force that
slowly crushes a deformable cardboard box. With real-time tactile feedback, the
robot transforms this motion into a gentle, stable grasp, successfully
manipulating the object without causing structural damage. This work provides a
robust and well-characterized platform to enable future research in advanced
whole-body control and physical human-robot interaction.

*Jiajie Li,Boyang Sun,Luca Di Giammarino,Hermann Blum,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ActLoc, a framework that selects optimal camera viewpoints to enhance localization accuracy during robot navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable localization can be problematic when robots encounter unmapped or ambiguous areas, and current systems fail to consider viewpoint informativeness.

Method: ActLoc uses a trained attention-based model to predict localization accuracy based on viewpoint directions and integrates these predictions into a path planner.

Result: ActLoc outperforms alternatives in choosing single viewpoints and performs well in trajectory planning, while being adaptable to various navigation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework improves localization robustness and offers modular adaptability, enhancing general robot navigation performance.

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UltraTac integrates visuotactile imaging and ultrasound sensing for advanced object recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of visuotactile sensors in material features detection and enhance robotic manipulation systems.

Method: Developing an optoacoustic architecture combining visuotactile imaging and ultrasound sensing with shared structural components and precise coordination.

Result: Experiments show proximity sensing (3-8 cm, $R^2=0.90$), 99.20% material classification accuracy, and 92.11% dual-mode recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: UltraTac is a versatile sensor enhancing human-machine interaction and robotic precision by combining tactile and ultrasound modalities.

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors provide high-resolution tactile information but are
incapable of perceiving the material features of objects. We present UltraTac,
an integrated sensor that combines visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing
through a coaxial optoacoustic architecture. The design shares structural
components and achieves consistent sensing regions for both modalities.
Additionally, we incorporate acoustic matching into the traditional
visuotactile sensor structure, enabling integration of the ultrasound sensing
modality without compromising visuotactile performance. Through tactile
feedback, we dynamically adjust the operating state of the ultrasound module to
achieve flexible functional coordination. Systematic experiments demonstrate
three key capabilities: proximity sensing in the 3-8 cm range ($R^2=0.90$),
material classification (average accuracy: 99.20%), and texture-material
dual-mode object recognition achieving 92.11% accuracy on a 15-class task.
Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic manipulation system to
concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content, which
verifies its potential for advanced human-machine interaction and precise
robotic manipulation.

### [268] [Rapid Mismatch Estimation via Neural Network Informed Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21007)
*Mateusz Jaszczuk,Nadia Figueroa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), a probabilistic framework for online estimation of end-effector dynamics mismatches in robot manipulators without external sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots increasingly operate in human-centric environments, requiring safe and efficient physical interactions. Accurate dynamics modeling is critical for this, but model mismatches lead to unsafe and unreliable behaviors.

Method: The proposed method, RME, combines Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimators with Variational Inference to estimate dynamics mismatches online. It uses proprioceptive feedback and adapts rapidly to changes without needing external force-torque sensors.

Result: RME successfully adapts to sudden mass and center of mass changes at the end-effector within approximately 400 ms in various experimental settings using a 7-DoF manipulator with a passive impedance controller.

Conclusion: RME enables safe and rapid adaptation to changing dynamics in collaborative robot settings, enhancing task reliability and safety without the need for external sensory systems.

Abstract: With robots increasingly operating in human-centric environments, ensuring
soft and safe physical interactions, whether with humans, surroundings, or
other machines, is essential. While compliant hardware can facilitate such
interactions, this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow
torque-controlled robots to safely and passively respond to contact while
accurately executing tasks. From inverse dynamics to quadratic
programming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on
accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model
mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce
Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic,
probabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online,
without relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's
proprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a
prior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the
unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator
driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden
changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$ ms, in
static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario
where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and
dynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to
changing dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory
system.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study presents a hierarchical framework combining a model-based planner and reinforcement learning for enabling humanoid robots to play table tennis with high agility and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of humanoid robots in rapid manipulation tasks, exemplified by table tennis where rapid perception and precision are critical.

Method: The framework includes model-based planning for ball trajectory prediction and racket target planning, combined with a reinforcement learning-based whole-body controller for generating coordinated robotic movements. Human motion references are incorporated into training.

Result: Validation on a general-purpose humanoid robot showed success with a record of 106 consecutive shots against a human opponent and sustained exchanges versus another humanoid.

Conclusion: This work establishes a pathway for achieving agile, interactive behaviors in humanoid robots, showcasing real-world performance in table tennis with sub-second reactive control.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have recently achieved impressive progress in locomotion and
whole-body control, yet they remain constrained in tasks that demand rapid
interaction with dynamic environments through manipulation. Table tennis
exemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must
perceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both
agility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for
humanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory
prediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based
whole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and
timing, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that
mimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive
rallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are
incorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose
humanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and
sustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate
real-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a
step toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors.

Conclusion: Prompt-to-Product paves the way for turning imaginative ideas into real-world LEGO constructions with minimal effort.

Abstract: Creating assembly products demands significant manual effort and expert
knowledge in 1) designing the assembly and 2) constructing the product. This
paper introduces Prompt-to-Product, an automated pipeline that generates
real-world assembly products from natural language prompts. Specifically, we
leverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of
creating brick assembly structures. Given the user design requirements,
Prompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then
leverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,
bringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user
study, and the results demonstrate that Prompt-to-Product significantly lowers
the barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from
imaginative ideas.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for online adaptive learning to bridge the sim-to-real gap in robotic control policies using refined dynamics modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in transferring simulation-based control policies to real-world scenarios due to unmodeled dynamics and disturbances.

Method: A novel framework combining residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation using a differentiable simulation that updates continuously with real-world data.

Result: The framework demonstrated significant improvements (e.g., reduced hovering errors by up to 81% compared to L1-MPC) and robustness under various disturbances.

Conclusion: The approach provides rapid adaptation capabilities, improving policy performance in unseen real-world conditions effectively compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Learning control policies in simulation enables rapid, safe, and
cost-effective development of advanced robotic capabilities. However,
transferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the
sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can
degrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization
and Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle
under out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In
this work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of
relying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly
adapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve
this, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies
residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a
differentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework
refines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled
effects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics
model is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient
backpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy
updates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of
our system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to
unseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on
agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the
real world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to
L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in
vision-based control without explicit state estimation.

### [272] [Evaluating LLMs on microservice-based applications: how complex is your specification?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20119)
*Daniel M. Yellin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can generate code for microservice-based applications. It finds that LLMs perform adequately on medium-difficulty problems but struggle with high-difficulty specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to assess the capability of LLMs in addressing the coding challenges of real-world scenarios, specifically focusing on microservice-based architectures.

Method: The study uses a standardized template to specify microservice-based applications and a difficulty metric to evaluate LLM performance. Unit test frameworks automate code testing.

Result: The analysis shows that LLMs perform reasonably well on moderately challenging tasks but fail on higher-difficulty ones due to factors like complex business logic, external service interaction, database integration, and non-functional requirements.

Conclusion: Enhancements in LLMs are needed to tackle the intricacies of real-world code synthesis, and the study offers insights into challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate how far LLMs have advanced in generating code for
real-world problems. Specifically, we explore code synthesis for
microservice-based applications, a widely used architecture pattern. We define
a standard template for specifying these applications, and we propose a metric
for judging the difficulty level of a specification. The higher the score, the
more difficult it is to generate code for the specification. We develop a
framework to automate the process of testing LLM-synthesized code for a
microservice using unit tests. Our experimental results show that strong LLMs
(like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do
very poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate
business logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and
inclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication. We analyzed
the errors in LLM-synthesized code and report on the key challenges LLMs face
in generating code for these specifications thereby suggesting future research
directions to improve code synthesis for real-world problems.

*Yunlong Feng,Yang Xu,Xiao Xu,Binyuan Hui,Junyang Lin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework focused on generating efficient code, addressing runtime limitations in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code generation by large language models often results in inefficient code unsuitable for performance-sensitive applications.

Method: They propose using a performance reward within a reinforcement learning framework, incorporating dynamic exploration, error-insensitive adjustments, and a two-stage tuning method.

Result: The method improves code correctness by 10.18% and runtime efficiency by 7.75% on a 7B model, matching much larger models in performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances both correctness and runtime efficiency, making it practical for performance-sensitive coding scenarios.

Abstract: While code large language models have demonstrated remarkable progress in
code generation, the generated code often exhibits poor runtime efficiency,
limiting its practical application in performance-sensitive scenarios. To
address this limitation, we propose an efficiency-oriented reinforcement
learning framework guided by a novel performance reward. Based on this
framework, we take a deeper dive into the code efficiency problem, identifying
then proposing methods to overcome key bottlenecks: (1) Dynamic exploration
overcomes the static data constraints of offline fine-tuning, enabling the
discovery of more efficient code implementations. (2) The error-insensitive
reinforcement learning method and high-contrast efficiency signals are crucial
for mitigating systematic errors and achieving effective optimization. (3)
Online exploration is most effective when starting from a high-correctness
baseline, as this allows for efficiency improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. With these discoveries, we finally propose a two-stage tuning method,
which achieves high and balanced performance across correctness and efficiency.
The results of experiments show the effectiveness of the method, which improves
code correctness by 10.18\% and runtime efficiency by 7.75\% on a 7B model,
achieving performance comparable to much larger model.

Motivation: SMT solvers are critical in modern programming and system tasks, but their correctness depends on high-quality test formulas. Current solutions fail to keep up with the solvers' evolving features, and LLM-based approaches face syntactic and computational challenges.

Method: Chimera shifts from direct formula generation to creating reusable term generators. It uses LLMs to extract grammars from documentation and synthesize term generators, which integrate terms into structural formula skeletons to ensure syntactic and semantic value.

Result: Chimera was tested on SMT solvers Z3 and cvc5, discovering 43 bugs, with 40 already resolved by the developers, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: Chimera provides a scalable, low-cost approach to enhance SMT solver testing by leveraging LLM-extracted grammars and composable term generators, significantly advancing the detection of bugs in solvers.

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems
and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like
symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the
critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas
are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed
well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly
evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show
promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain:
nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative
interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In
this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that
addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the
synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly,
Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for
SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)
synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.
During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing
formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.
This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.
Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,
dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT
solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43
confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.

### [275] [Adaptive Root Cause Localization for Microservice Systems with Multi-Agent Recursion-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20370)
*Lingzhe Zhang,Tong Jia,Kangjin Wang,Weijie Hong,Chiming Duan,Minghua He,Ying Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces RCLAgent, a method for accurately localizing the root causes of failures in complex microservice systems using a novel recursion-of-thought strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity and frequent failures in modern microservice systems require more effective root cause localization methods as existing approaches struggle with adapting to evolving contexts or lack interpretability.

Method: The authors studied human root cause analysis to identify key traits and proposed RCLAgent, which utilizes a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework for reasoning and analysis.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that RCLAgent outperforms state-of-the-art methods by accurately identifying root causes from a single request without relying on aggregated data.

Conclusion: RCLAgent significantly improves the precision and efficiency of root cause localization in microservice systems, addressing challenges in existing methods.

Abstract: As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and
complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained,
interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring
system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces
and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing
methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to
evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning
process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this
paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of
failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different
organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis
exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion,
and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent,
an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that
leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a
novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process,
effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to
accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public
datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing
the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art
methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore
the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root
cause localization in complex microservice environments.

*Wei Ma,Yixiao Yang,Qiang Hu,Shi Ying,Zhi Jin,Bo Du,Zhenchang Xing,Tianlin Li,Junjie Shi,Yang Liu,Linxiao Jiang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a structured approach to testing and quality assurance for complex LLM applications, introducing a three-layer architecture and a communication protocol for agent interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM applications face challenges like non-determinism, dynamism, and context-dependence, complicating their quality assurance. Current testing methods lack compatibility with the unique demands of LLM-based systems.

Method: The authors decompose LLM applications into three layers—System Shell, Prompt Orchestration, and Inference Core. They analyze testing methods for each layer, highlight challenges, and propose four collaborative strategies (Retain, Translate, Integrate, Runtime). Additionally, they introduce Agent Interaction Communication Language (AICL) to standardize agent communication.

Result: They identify six core challenges stemming from structural differences in existing testing approaches, propose a trustworthy quality assurance framework, and design AICL as a practical, test-oriented communication protocol for AI systems.

Conclusion: This work bridges gaps in traditional software testing and AI safety methods for LLMs by providing a comprehensive framework and practical tools. It advances the standardization of LLM application testing and emphasizes runtime monitoring for trustworthy applications.

Abstract: Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text
generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation,
tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism,
dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality
assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer
architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt
Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess
the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer:
directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at
the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference
core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software
engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community
reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics,
and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that
underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of
collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate},
and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance
framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring.
Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal
to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We
propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}}
(AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the
test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.

### [278] [From Law to Gherkin: A Human-Centred Quasi-Experiment on the Quality of LLM-Generated Behavioural Specifications from Food-Safety Regulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20744)
*Shabnam Hassani,Mehrdad Sabetzadeh,Daniel Amyot*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the derivation of behavioral specifications from legal texts using a systematic human-subject study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineers face challenges in translating technology-neutral legal texts into compliance artifacts, a process that is labor-intensive and error-prone. The study explores the potential of Generative AI, particularly LLMs, to automate this process.

Method: The study involved 10 participants evaluating Gherkin-based specifications generated from food-safety regulations by two LLMs, Claude and Llama. Sixty specifications were assessed on five criteria (Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings) with 120 total assessments conducted.

Result: Specifications achieved high ratings: Relevance (75% top), Clarity (90% top), Completeness (75% top), Singularity (82% top), and Time Savings (68% top). Both models performed well without significant differences, though Llama slightly outperformed in some areas.

Conclusion: LLMs are capable of generating high-quality, developer-friendly specifications from legal texts, significantly reducing manual effort and offering tools for implementation and verification.

Abstract: Context: Laws and regulations increasingly affect software design and quality
assurance, but legal texts are written in technology-neutral language. This
creates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as
requirements and acceptance criteria. Manual creation is labor-intensive,
error-prone, and requires domain expertise. Advances in Generative AI (GenAI),
especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such
artifacts.
  Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs'
ability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a
quasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements
into a developer-friendly form.
  Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety
regulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60
specifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five
criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each
specification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments.
  Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest.
Clarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second.
Singularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No
lowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences
across participants or models. Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity,
Completeness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity.
Feedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the
specifications.
  Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal
texts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for
implementation, assurance, and test generation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper identifies sustainability as a crucial consideration in software systems and proposes a structured architectural perspective to integrate sustainability concerns during the design phase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sustainability is an emerging quality property in software systems, and there is a lack of structured guidance for architects to incorporate it effectively.

Method: The authors construct a sustainability perspective vision using evidence from snowballing seminal literature and focus group discussions with experts.

Result: The study confirmed the relevance of various architectural perspective elements in practice and provided insights for creating a sustainability perspective tailored to industry requirements.

Conclusion: A sustainability perspective can guide architects in embedding sustainability considerations in software design while addressing industrial needs.

Abstract: Sustainability is increasingly recognized as an emerging quality property in
software-intensive systems, yet architects lack structured guidance to address
it effectively throughout the software design phase. Architectural
perspectives-an architectural knowledge artifact composed of concerns,
activities, tactics, pitfalls, and checklists-offer a promising approach to
tackle such emerging quality properties across architectural views and are also
independent of architecture frameworks and industry contexts. In this paper, we
present a sustainability perspective vision, i.e., a revised notion of
architectural perspective meant to be filled with its own elements to target
sustainability concerns. We formulate our sustainability perspective vision
through evidence from applying snowballing to seminal literature and from
conducting a focus group with experts in the field. Our findings confirm the
relevance of the different perspective elements in practice and highlight
implications for shaping a sustainability perspective that meets industrial
needs.

*Baharin A. Jodat,Khouloud Gaaloul,Mehrdad Sabetzadeh,Shiva Nejati*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes assertion-based test oracles for cost-effective and reliable simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS), leveraging logical predicates to predict test verdicts without execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce costs and improve reliability in CPS testing due to expensive simulations and potential flakiness of CPS simulators.

Method: Generate assertion-based test oracles using two methods: genetic programming (GP) with various fault localization formulas, or decision trees and rules. Evaluate them across different CPS domains.

Result: Test oracles generated using GP with the Ochiai formula demonstrated significantly higher accuracy compared to other methods and showed robustness against flaky system behaviors, with just 4% variation in results.

Conclusion: Assertion-based test oracles, especially those generated via GP with Ochiai, are a promising solution to improve CPS testing by minimizing costs, ensuring robustness, and maintaining accuracy despite flaky simulators.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is costly due to the
time-consuming execution of CPS simulators. In addition, CPS simulators may be
flaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test
re-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not
require system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.
Ideally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human
understanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential
flakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test
oracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the
inputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test
oracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,
fails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe
two methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic
programming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization
(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness
functions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We
evaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains
of aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles
generated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those
obtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this
accuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system
under test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by
GP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in
their accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving
systems with flaky behaviours.

*Zuocheng Feng,Kaiwen Zhang,Miaomiao Wang,Yiming Cheng,Yuandao Cai,Xiaofeng Li,Guanjun Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A novel method integrates pre-trained models and graph neural networks to improve concurrency bug detection and localization, achieving significant accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concurrency bugs are hard to detect and compromise system reliability due to improper synchronization in multi-threaded or distributed setups.

Method: The study constructs a specialized concurrency bug dataset and utilizes a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) in combination with a heterogeneous graph neural network, supplemented by SubgraphX for bug localization.

Result: The method shows an average improvement of 10% in accuracy and precision, and 26% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses key limitations of existing techniques, enhancing both detection and debugging processes for concurrency bugs.

Abstract: Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in
multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus
compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning
methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and
dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack
sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary
classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as
precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for
effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a
dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation.
We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network
(GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that
concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further
facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method,
which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them
to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an
improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to
state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.

*Shiwen Shan,Yintong Huo,Yuxin Su,Zhining Wang,Dan Li,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes ConfLogger, a tool that uses static taint analysis and LLM-based log generation to improve the diagnosability of software configurations, yielding significant benefits in error localization and troubleshooting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on whether software logs provide sufficient diagnostic information for configuration-related issues in existing diagnosability approaches.

Method: ConfLogger combines configuration-aware static taint analysis to identify sensitive code segments and LLM-based log generation to create diagnostics-enhancing logs.

Result: ConfLogger achieved 100% accuracy in localizing errors in silent misconfigurations, improved diagnostic coverage and precision compared to baselines, and sped up diagnostic time while improving troubleshooting accuracy.

Conclusion: ConfLogger successfully enhances software configuration diagnosability and serves as a valuable tool for improving error analysis and resolution processes in complex configurable systems.

Abstract: Modern configurable systems offer customization via intricate configuration
spaces, yet such flexibility introduces pervasive configuration-related issues
such as misconfigurations and latent softwarebugs. Existing diagnosability
supports focus on post-failure analysis of software behavior to identify
configuration issues, but none of these approaches look into whether the
software clue sufficient failure information for diagnosis. To fill in the
blank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging
practices at the source code level. We develop ConfLogger, the first tool that
unifies configuration-aware static taint analysis with LLM-based log generation
to enhance software configuration diagnosability. Specifically, our method 1)
identifies configuration-sensitive code segments by tracing
configuration-related data flow in the whole project, and 2) generates
diagnostic log statements by analyzing configuration code contexts. Evaluation
results on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of
ConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically,
ConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration
diagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent
misconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit
configuration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74%
coverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers
by 12% and 30%. It also gains 8.6% higher in precision, 79.3% higher in recall,
and 26.2% higher in F1 compared to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of
variable logging while also augmenting diagnostic value. A controlled user
study on 22 cases further validated its utility, speeding up diagnostic time by
1.25x and improving troubleshooting accuracy by 251.4%.

engineering professionalism, profiling five leaders; it then examines the
field's recent attention to gender issues and gender bias. It next
quantitatively analyzes women's participation as research authors in the
field's leading International Conference of Software Engineering (1976-2010),
finding a dozen years with statistically significant gender exclusion. Policy
dimensions of research on gender bias in computing are suggested.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified theory of language combining Bayesian cognitive linguistic models with the idea of sexual selection theory, addressing language speed, diversity, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive explanation of language evolution, diversity, processing, and its foundational role in human cognition and culture.

Method: Integrates Construction Grammars, Bayesian inference, graph-like feature structures, unification, and evolutionary principles to explain language processing and learning.

Result: The theory provides a unified framework to account for phonology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and their seamless computation alongside pragmatic phenomena.

Conclusion: Language is integral to human cultural and societal development, bridging evolutionary cognition and advanced linguistic capabilities through Bayesian pattern matching and unification.

Abstract: A unified theory of language combines a Bayesian cognitive linguistic model
of language processing, with the proposal that language evolved by sexual
selection for the display of intelligence. The theory accounts for the major
facts of language, including its speed and expressivity, and data on language
diversity, pragmatics, syntax and semantics. The computational element of the
theory is based on Construction Grammars. These give an account of the syntax
and semantics of the worlds languages, using constructions and unification. Two
novel elements are added to construction grammars: an account of language
pragmatics, and an account of fast, precise language learning. Constructions
are represented in the mind as graph like feature structures. People use slow
general inference to understand the first few examples they hear of any
construction. After that it is learned as a feature structure, and is rapidly
applied by unification. All aspects of language (phonology, syntax, semantics,
and pragmatics) are seamlessly computed by fast unification; there is no
boundary between semantics and pragmatics. This accounts for the major puzzles
of pragmatics, and for detailed pragmatic phenomena. Unification is Bayesian
maximum likelihood pattern matching. This gives evolutionary continuity between
language processing in the human brain, and Bayesian cognition in animal
brains. Language is the basis of our mind reading abilities, our cooperation,
self esteem and emotions; the foundations of human culture and society.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the essence of motivation and value in AI systems by analyzing them through the lens of entropy maximization and energetic constraints.

Method: Examines entropy maximization and its relationship with endogenous actions in living agents versus simulated AI systems, emphasizing their thermodynamic computation.

Result: Demonstrates how true desire and motivation depend on the intertwined nature of cognitive and physical aspects, and identifies issues like reward hacking in AI without endogenous motivation.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of embedding thermodynamic-like computation in AI systems to achieve authentic value alignment and avoid pathologies inherent in simulated agents.

Abstract: I consider motivation and value-alignment in AI systems from the perspective
of (constrained) entropy maximization. Though the structures encoding knowledge
in any physical system can be understood as energetic constraints, only living
agents harness entropy in the endogenous generation of actions. I argue that
this exploitation of "mortal" or thermodynamic computation, in which cognitive
and physical dynamics are inseparable, is of the essence of desire, motivation,
and value, while the lack of true endogenous motivation in simulated "agents"
predicts pathologies like reward hacking.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper studies stochastic gradient algorithms in learning problems with unknown nuisance parameters and presents convergence guarantees, even modifying the algorithm for specific cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses how stochastic gradient algorithms are influenced by unknown nuisance parameters in optimization problems and seeks to establish robust convergence guarantees.

Method: The paper analyzes stochastic gradient algorithms under conditions like Neyman orthogonality and suggests modifications with orthogonalized updates for cases where this condition does not hold.

Result: The research demonstrates that classical stochastic gradient algorithms can converge under certain conditions, and modified versions with orthogonalized gradients can maintain effective convergence rates when conditions are unmet.

Conclusion: Stochastic gradient algorithms can remain effective despite unknown nuisances, and modified approaches broaden their applicability to complex scenarios like causal inference and double machine learning.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is the dominant learning paradigm for a
variety of scenarios, from classical supervised learning to modern
self-supervised learning. We consider stochastic gradient algorithms for
learning problems whose objectives rely on unknown nuisance parameters, and
establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Our results show that, while
the presence of a nuisance can alter the optimum and upset the optimization
trajectory, the classical stochastic gradient algorithm may still converge
under appropriate conditions, such as Neyman orthogonality. Moreover, even when
Neyman orthogonality is not satisfied, we show that an algorithm variant with
approximately orthogonalized updates (with an approximately orthogonalized
gradient oracle) may achieve similar convergence rates. Examples from
orthogonal statistical learning/double machine learning and causal inference
are discussed.

*Šimon Kucharský,Aayush Mishra,Daniel Habermann,Stefan T. Radev,Paul-Christian Bürkner*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This study improves Bayesian model comparison by introducing a self-consistency loss for neural surrogate models to address model misspecification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of unreliable neural surrogates in Bayesian model comparison, especially under model misspecification.

Method: The authors add a self-consistency loss to simulation-based training of Bayesian model comparison using unlabeled real data, and assess its impact with numerical experiments and real case studies.

Result: The self-consistency loss improves calibration under model misspecification when analytic likelihoods are available, but offers limited benefits when neural surrogate likelihoods are used.

Conclusion: The proposed self-consistency loss enhances reliability under certain conditions but requires analytic likelihoods for trustworthy Bayesian model comparison.

Abstract: Amortized Bayesian model comparison (BMC) enables fast probabilistic ranking
of models via simulation-based training of neural surrogates. However, the
reliability of neural surrogates deteriorates when simulation models are
misspecified - the very case where model comparison is most needed. Thus, we
supplement simulation-based training with a self-consistency (SC) loss on
unlabeled real data to improve BMC estimates under empirical distribution
shifts. Using a numerical experiment and two case studies with real data, we
compare amortized evidence estimates with and without SC against analytic or
bridge sampling benchmarks. SC improves calibration under model
misspecification when having access to analytic likelihoods. However, it offers
limited gains with neural surrogate likelihoods, making it most practical for
trustworthy BMC when likelihoods are exact.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the use of polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) for operator learning (OL) to approximate mappings in functional spaces, providing a framework that is both computationally efficient and enables uncertainty quantification (UQ).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternative methods for operator learning (OL) beyond deep neural networks, leveraging established mathematical tools such as polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) for improved accuracy and computational efficiency, as well as integrated uncertainty quantification (UQ).

Method: The paper develops a mathematical framework that uses PCE to approximate operators either through data-driven or physics-informed approaches. The process simplifies OL to solving a system of equations for PCE coefficients, which also facilitate UQ without extra computational overhead.

Result: The proposed PCE-based method achieves strong performance in solving PDE-related operator learning tasks. It demonstrates high numerical accuracy and computational efficiency, along with effective uncertainty quantification through coefficient post-processing.

Conclusion: PCE offers a reliable and computationally efficient alternative to deep learning methods for operator learning, with added benefits of integrated uncertainty quantification. The approach is robust and applicable to various PDE problems, proving its practical value in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Operator learning (OL) has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific machine
learning (SciML) for approximating mappings between infinite-dimensional
functional spaces. One of its main applications is learning the solution
operator of partial differential equations (PDEs). While much of the progress
in this area has been driven by deep neural network-based approaches such as
Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), recent
work has begun to explore traditional machine learning methods for OL. In this
work, we introduce polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) as an OL method. PCE has
been widely used for uncertainty quantification (UQ) and has recently gained
attention in the context of SciML. For OL, we establish a mathematical
framework that enables PCE to approximate operators in both purely data-driven
and physics-informed settings. The proposed framework reduces the task of
learning the operator to solving a system of equations for the PCE
coefficients. Moreover, the framework provides UQ by simply post-processing the
PCE coefficients, without any additional computational cost. We apply the
proposed method to a diverse set of PDE problems to demonstrate its
capabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the strong performance of the
proposed method in both OL and UQ tasks, achieving excellent numerical accuracy
and computational efficiency.

*Xiaohan Wang,Yang Ning*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to extend transfer learning to decision rules by modeling posterior drift and reformulating it as a low-dimensional empirical risk minimization problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance transfer learning for classification by incorporating decision rules and addressing posterior drift effectively.

Method: The method leverages Bayes decision rules and geometric transformations of decision boundaries, supported by theoretical guarantees of consistency and risk bounds.

Result: Simulation studies and real-world data analyses show improved performance and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is broadly applicable, including in estimating optimal individualized treatment rules, with evidence of its effectiveness and reliability.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the transfer learning classification framework from
regression function-based methods to decision rules. We propose a novel
methodology for modeling posterior drift through Bayes decision rules. By
exploiting the geometric transformation of the Bayes decision boundary, our
method reformulates the problem as a low-dimensional empirical risk
minimization problem. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish the
consistency of our estimators and derive the risk bounds. Moreover, we
illustrate the broad applicability of our method by adapting it to the
estimation of optimal individualized treatment rules. Extensive simulation
studies and analyses of real-world data further demonstrate both superior
performance and robustness of our approach.

*Li Luo,Yisheng Fang,Wanyi Zhang,Zhichao Ruan*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a photonic restricted Boltzmann machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to enhance Gibbs sampling efficiency, overcoming computational bottlenecks in neural network-based content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational limitations of Gibbs sampling in Restricted Boltzmann Machines hinder their efficiency in generative tasks, particularly with large-scale models.

Method: The authors propose a photonic computing architecture combined with an encoding method to reduce Gibbs sampling computational complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ and eliminate dependency on memory storage for interaction matrices.

Result: Experimental validation shows the PRBM can simulate phase transition temperatures accurately and generate diverse content, including images and sequences, robustly even under noise and aberrations.

Conclusion: The PRBM's scalability and reduced training cost highlight its potential to advance photonic computing for generative AI applications.

Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising
model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and
stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of
Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on
electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann
machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling,
enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding
method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix
decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from
$O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture
circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial
advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the
photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising
model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the
theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates
robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including
images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations.
The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its
potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative
artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the complexity of determining the flux tube width in EST, an essential aspect of confinement in Yang-Mills theory.

Method: The authors use deep learning techniques based on generative algorithms to perform numerical explorations of EST.

Result: The paper presents results for the width of the Nambu-Goto EST.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the viability of employing deep learning to analyze complex problems in EST, providing insights into the flux tube width.

Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) offers a robust non-perturbative framework for
describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory by treating the confining flux tube
between a static quark-antiquark pair as a thin, vibrating string. While EST
calculations are typically carried out using zeta-function regularization,
certain problems-such as determining the flux tube width-are too complex to
solve analytically. However, recent studies have demonstrated that EST can be
explored numerically by employing deep learning techniques based on generative
algorithms. In this work, we provide a brief introduction to EST and this novel
numerical approach. Finally, we present results for the width of the
Nambu-Got\"o EST.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale dataset and a suite of models for zero-shot speech recognition, reaching performance comparable to OpenAI's Whisper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the influence of training data scale and quality on speech recognition and develop robust zero-shot models.

Method: Created a dataset (OLMoASR-Pool), applied heuristic filters for quality, and trained models (OLMoASR) with varying parameter sizes.

Result: OLMoASR models perform comparably to OpenAI's Whisper, with competitive word error rates on both short and long-form recognition tasks.

Conclusion: OLMoASR demonstrates the efficacy of high-quality datasets and curation for speech recognition, promoting open research with public availability of resources.

Abstract: Improvements in training data scale and quality have led to significant
advances, yet its influence in speech recognition remains underexplored. In
this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, and series of
models, OLMoASR, to study and develop robust zero-shot speech recognition
models. Beginning from OLMoASR-Pool, a collection of 3M hours of English audio
and 17M transcripts, we design text heuristic filters to remove low-quality or
mistranscribed data. Our curation pipeline produces a new dataset containing 1M
hours of high-quality audio-transcript pairs, which we call OLMoASR-Mix. We use
OLMoASR-Mix to train the OLMoASR-Mix suite of models, ranging from 39M
(tiny.en) to 1.5B (large.en) parameters. Across all model scales, OLMoASR
achieves comparable average performance to OpenAI's Whisper on short and
long-form speech recognition benchmarks. Notably, OLMoASR-medium.en attains a
12.8\% and 11.0\% word error rate (WER) that is on par with Whisper's largest
English-only model Whisper-medium.en's 12.4\% and 10.5\% WER for short and
long-form recognition respectively (at equivalent parameter count).
OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and filtering, training and evaluation code will
be made publicly available to further research on robust speech processing.

### [293] [Flowing Straighter with Conditional Flow Matching for Accurate Speech Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20584)
*Mattias Cross,Anton Ragni*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of straight and curved probability paths in flow-based generative speech enhancement, showing that straighter paths improve speech quality metrics and introducing a one-step predictive flow-based model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the implications of curved probability paths in flow-based generative speech enhancement and explore whether straight paths offer better performance while being easier to train.

Method: The authors quantified the path straightness's effect on speech enhancement quality using experiments based on the Schrodinger bridge and proposed a new independent conditional flow-matching method focused on straight paths. They also presented a one-step inference solution for flow-based models.

Result: Empirical results show that straighter, time-independent probability paths, particularly through conditional flow matching, enhanced speech quality metrics. However, an initial downside was the requirement for multiple inference steps, which was resolved with the one-step predictive flow solution.

Conclusion: Time-independent, straighter probability paths are more effective for generative speech enhancement than time-dependent, curved paths. The proposed conditional flow matching and one-step inference model improve speech quality while mitigating training complications.

Abstract: Current flow-based generative speech enhancement methods learn curved
probability paths which model a mapping between clean and noisy speech. Despite
impressive performance, the implications of curved probability paths are
unknown. Methods such as Schrodinger bridges focus on curved paths, where
time-dependent gradients and variance do not promote straight paths. Findings
in machine learning research suggest that straight paths, such as conditional
flow matching, are easier to train and offer better generalisation. In this
paper we quantify the effect of path straightness on speech enhancement
quality. We report experiments with the Schrodinger bridge, where we show that
certain configurations lead to straighter paths. Conversely, we propose
independent conditional flow-matching for speech enhancement, which models
straight paths between noisy and clean speech. We demonstrate empirically that
a time-independent variance has a greater effect on sample quality than the
gradient. Although conditional flow matching improves several speech quality
metrics, it requires multiple inference steps. We rectify this with a one-step
solution by inferring the trained flow-based model as if it was directly
predictive. Our work suggests that straighter time-independent probability
paths improve generative speech enhancement over curved time-dependent paths.

*Hongju Su,Ke Li,Lan Yang,Honggang Zhang,Yi-Zhe Song*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Amadeus introduces a novel approach to symbolic music generation, improving performance and enabling new features beyond state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate limitations in current symbolic music generation models that rely on strict unidirectional dependencies among musical note attributes.

Method: Developed a two-level architecture with an autoregressive note sequence model and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes, enhanced by MLSDES and CIEM strategies.

Result: Amadeus outperforms state-of-the-art models in multiple metrics, achieves 4x speed improvement, and offers fine-grained attribute control.

Conclusion: This approach redefines symbolic music generation paradigms, demonstrating both performance gains and novel functionalities like training-free attribute manipulation.

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art symbolic music generation models predominantly
adopt autoregressive or hierarchical autoregressive architectures, modelling
symbolic music as a sequence of attribute tokens with unidirectional temporal
dependencies, under the assumption of a fixed, strict dependency structure
among these attributes. However, we observe that using different attributes as
the initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This
suggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent
and unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this
insight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework.
Amadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note
sequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To
enhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement
Strategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify
discriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional
Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent
vector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note
decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and
text-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA
models across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\times$ speed-up.
Furthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control
feasibility using our model. To explore the upper performance bound of the
Amadeus architecture, we compile the largest open-source symbolic music dataset
to date, AMD (Amadeus MIDI Dataset), supporting both pre-training and
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces MARVEL, a framework for diagnosing multiple health conditions from voice using acoustic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to develop scalable, non-invasive voice-based diagnosis for multiple health conditions in resource-constrained settings.

Method: The MARVEL framework uses multitask learning with dual-branch architecture and task-specific encoders, trained on the Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset.

Result: MARVEL achieved an overall AUROC of 0.78, with the highest performance in detecting neurological disorders (AUROC = 0.89), particularly Alzheimer's (AUROC = 0.97), outperforming baselines and state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The findings illustrate the potential of a single model for diverse voice-based health screening, offering promise for practical deployment in remote healthcare settings.

Abstract: Voice-based health assessment offers unprecedented opportunities for
scalable, non-invasive disease screening, yet existing approaches typically
focus on single conditions and fail to leverage the rich, multi-faceted
information embedded in speech. We present MARVEL (Multi-task Acoustic
Representations for Voice-based Health Analysis), a privacy-conscious multitask
learning framework that simultaneously detects nine distinct neurological,
respiratory, and voice disorders using only derived acoustic features,
eliminating the need for raw audio transmission. Our dual-branch architecture
employs specialized encoders with task-specific heads sharing a common acoustic
backbone, enabling effective cross-condition knowledge transfer. Evaluated on
the large-scale Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset, MARVEL achieves an overall AUROC
of 0.78, with exceptional performance on neurological disorders (AUROC = 0.89),
particularly for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (AUROC = 0.97).
Our framework consistently outperforms single-modal baselines by 5-19% and
surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised models on 7 of 9 tasks, while
correlation analysis reveals that the learned representations exhibit
meaningful similarities with established acoustic features, indicating that the
model's internal representations are consistent with clinically recognized
acoustic patterns. By demonstrating that a single unified model can effectively
screen for diverse conditions, this work establishes a foundation for
deployable voice-based diagnostics in resource-constrained and remote
healthcare settings.

*Holger Severin Bovbjerg,Jan Østergaard,Jesper Jensen,Shinji Watanabe,Zheng-Hua Tan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper explores learning spatial representations from binaural speech using deep representation learning and a feature distillation approach, focusing on improving direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance spatial representation learning for multichannel audio, which is largely underexplored, and to improve DoA estimation performance in challenging noisy and reverberant environments.

Method: The approach involves a pretraining stage using feature distillation to learn spatial features from clean binaural speech samples, which are then predicted from augmented speech using a neural network. The pretrained encoder weights are later used to initialize a fine-tuning model for DoA estimation.

Result: Experiments showed that the pretrained models improved DoA estimation performance compared to both fully supervised models and classical signal processing, particularly in noisy and reverberant conditions.

Conclusion: Feature distillation-based pretraining effectively enhances spatial representation learning from binaural speech, leading to better DoA estimation, especially in challenging environments.

Abstract: Recently, deep representation learning has shown strong performance in
multiple audio tasks. However, its use for learning spatial representations
from multichannel audio is underexplored. We investigate the use of a
pretraining stage based on feature distillation to learn a robust spatial
representation of binaural speech without the need for data labels. In this
framework, spatial features are computed from clean binaural speech samples to
form prediction labels. These clean features are then predicted from
corresponding augmented speech using a neural network. After pretraining, we
throw away the spatial feature predictor and use the learned encoder weights to
initialize a DoA estimation model which we fine-tune for DoA estimation. Our
experiments demonstrate that the pretrained models show improved performance in
noisy and reverberant environments after fine-tuning for direction-of-arrival
estimation, when compared to fully supervised models and classic signal
processing methods.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal framework for speech emotion recognition using entropy-aware score fusion combining predictions from speech and text models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in single-modality speech emotion recognition systems by integrating audio and text predictions for more reliable performance.

Method: It combines an acoustic model (wav2vec2.0) and text sentiment analysis (via RoBERTa-XLM) with transcriptions by Whisper-large-v3, and uses entropy-based late fusion of scores and sentiment mapping strategies.

Result: The technique improves performance on speech emotion recognition benchmarks like IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV, outperforming traditional single-modality methods.

Conclusion: This multimodal approach enhances speech emotion recognition reliability and may serve as a practical alternative to single-modality frameworks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework for speech emotion
recognition that leverages entropy-aware score selection to combine speech and
textual predictions. The proposed method integrates a primary pipeline that
consists of an acoustic model based on wav2vec2.0 and a secondary pipeline that
consists of a sentiment analysis model using RoBERTa-XLM, with transcriptions
generated via Whisper-large-v3. We propose a late score fusion approach based
on entropy and varentropy thresholds to overcome the confidence constraints of
primary pipeline predictions. A sentiment mapping strategy translates three
sentiment categories into four target emotion classes, enabling coherent
integration of multimodal predictions. The results on the IEMOCAP and
MSP-IMPROV datasets show that the proposed method offers a practical and
reliable enhancement over traditional single-modality systems.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces the World-of-Whale benchmark to test large audio language models (LALMs) in low-level auditory tasks using marine mammal vocalizations, highlighting their performance gap compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored ability of large audio language models (LALMs) to perform low-level listening tasks, which are essential for reasoning about unfamiliar sounds based on detailed acoustic cues.

Method: The authors developed the WoW-Bench, a benchmark containing two components: Perception tasks for sound categorization and Cognition tasks inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, with added distractor questions to ensure models rely on auditory problem-solving rather than heuristics.

Result: Experiments with state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that their performance is significantly inferior to human capabilities on the WoW-Bench, especially for novel and complex auditory tasks.

Conclusion: LALMs require improved auditory grounding to handle low-level listening tasks effectively, as they currently fall short of human-level auditory perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Large audio language models (LALMs) extend language understanding into the
auditory domain, yet their ability to perform low-level listening, such as
pitch and duration detection, remains underexplored. However, low-level
listening is critical for real-world, out-of-distribution tasks where models
must reason about unfamiliar sounds based on fine-grained acoustic cues. To
address this gap, we introduce the World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) to
evaluate low-level auditory perception and cognition using marine mammal
vocalizations. WoW-bench is composed of a Perception benchmark for categorizing
novel sounds and a Cognition benchmark, inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, to assess
the abilities to remember, understand, apply, and analyze sound events. For the
Cognition benchmark, we additionally introduce distractor questions to evaluate
whether models are truly solving problems through listening rather than relying
on other heuristics. Experiments with state-of-the-art LALMs show performance
far below human levels, indicating a need for stronger auditory grounding in
LALMs.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: MicroLad is a new latent diffusion model designed to generate 3D microstructures from 2D data, addressing challenges in materials engineering such as limited datasets and insufficient control of design spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets and challenges in establishing reliable structure-property linkages hinder progress in materials engineering.

Method: MicroLad uses latent diffusion frameworks, including multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling and score distillation sampling (SDS), for 3D reconstruction and guided microstructure generation.

Result: MicroLad successfully generates coherent, stable 3D structures statistically consistent with 2D data while enabling guided exploration of microstructure design based on specific objectives.

Conclusion: MicroLad enhances the ability to analyze and design 3D microstructures, overcoming current limitations and expanding possibilities in materials engineering research.

Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in
materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets.
Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and
design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies,
hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design
problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion
framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D
data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion
sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and
coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original
data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion
(2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data,
effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the
generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad
integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable
score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment
terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent
space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation.
Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D
microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural
descriptors and material properties.

*Parker Knight,Doudou Zhou,Zongqi Xia,Tianxi Cai,Junwei Lu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a latent factor point process model for capturing rich temporal structures in Electronic Health Records (EHR) data using a low-dimensional representation, demonstrated through theoretical guarantees and applications in Alzheimer's disease.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current statistical methods for EHR data overlook the rich temporal structure of patient records by reducing irregular timings into simple counts. There's a need for models that better utilize these temporal patterns for patient-level analysis.

Method: The paper proposes a latent factor point process model driven by a low-dimensional latent Poisson process. It also introduces Fourier-Eigen embeddings based on the spectral density matrix, which efficiently represent subgroup-specific temporal patterns.

Result: The proposed model and embeddings effectively capture clinically meaningful heterogeneity, as demonstrated through simulations and an application on Alzheimer's disease EHR cohorts.

Conclusion: The latent factor point process model and Fourier-Eigen embedding provide powerful tools for analyzing high-dimensional EHR data by uncovering temporal structures and facilitating classification and clustering tasks.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) contain valuable longitudinal patient-level
information, yet most statistical methods reduce the irregular timing of EHR
codes into simple counts, thereby discarding rich temporal structure. Existing
temporal models often impose restrictive parametric assumptions or are tailored
to code level rather than patient-level tasks. We propose the latent factor
point process model, which represents code occurrences as a high-dimensional
point process whose conditional intensity is driven by a low dimensional latent
Poisson process. This low-rank structure reflects the clinical reality that
thousands of codes are governed by a small number of underlying disease
processes, while enabling statistically efficient estimation in high
dimensions. Building on this model, we introduce the Fourier-Eigen embedding, a
patient representation constructed from the spectral density matrix of the
observed process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that these
embeddings efficiently capture subgroup-specific temporal patterns for
downstream classification and clustering. Simulations and an application to an
Alzheimer's disease EHR cohort demonstrate the practical advantages of our
approach in uncovering clinically meaningful heterogeneity.

Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can aid in analyzing complex, real-world domains like U.S. tax law to reduce revenue losses from tax minimization by well-advised taxpayers.

Method: The study assesses advanced LLMs on tasks of interpreting, verifying, completing, and generating tax strategies using the vast and dynamic body of U.S. tax laws and guidance.

Result: LLMs showcased strong reasoning abilities, including the discovery of a novel tax strategy, suggesting their capability to address challenges faced by human experts.

Conclusion: LLMs hold transformative potential in aiding tax authorities in combatting tax abuse through innovative strategy identification and sophisticated legal reasoning.

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models can discover and analyze U.S.
tax-minimization strategies. This real-world domain challenges even seasoned
human experts, and progress can reduce tax revenue lost from well-advised,
wealthy taxpayers. We evaluate the most advanced LLMs on their ability to (1)
interpret and verify tax strategies, (2) fill in gaps in partially specified
strategies, and (3) generate complete, end-to-end strategies from scratch. This
domain should be of particular interest to the LLM reasoning community: unlike
synthetic challenge problems or scientific reasoning tasks, U.S. tax law
involves navigating hundreds of thousands of pages of statutes, case law, and
administrative guidance, all updated regularly. Notably, LLM-based reasoning
identified an entirely novel tax strategy, highlighting these models' potential
to revolutionize tax agencies' fight against tax abuse.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metastasis in HNSCC poses significant challenges in clinical management, and reliable pre-treatment prediction of metastatic risk is essential for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.

Method: The method integrated CT imaging-derived tumor masks, 3D Swin Transformer-extracted features, radiomics data, and clinical variables into a multimodal framework. Features were fused and evaluated using a fully connected network with cross-validation metrics (AUC, ACC, SEN, SPE).

Result: The multimodal fusion model achieved improved predictive performance (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758), surpassing single-modality models.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach demonstrated high accuracy, generalizability across tumor subtypes, and robustness, making it a potential clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment planning in HNSCC.

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of
metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.
This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict
metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)
images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor
and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer
extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features
were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random
forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,
smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived
features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to
predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold
cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity
(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed
single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of
0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive
performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).
Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation
studies indicated complementary information from different modalities.
Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation
learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated
high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a
comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has
potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment
planning.

### [304] [MM-HSD: Multi-Modal Hate Speech Detection in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20546)
*Berta Céspedes-Sarrias,Carlos Collado-Capell,Pablo Rodenas-Ruiz,Olena Hrynenko,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces MM-HSD, a novel multi-modal model for hate speech detection (HSD) in videos, which combines video frames, audio, speech transcripts, and on-screen text for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing hate speech detection in videos, including the insufficient use of relevant modalities like on-screen text and audio and the failure to capture inter-modal dependencies with simple fusion methods.

Method: The authors present MM-HSD, a model that integrates different modalities such as video frames, audio, and text (speech transcripts and on-screen text), utilizing Cross-Modal Attention (CMA) as an early feature extractor to explore interactions between the modalities.

Result: The proposed MM-HSD model achieves an M-F1 score of 0.874 on the HateMM dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The analysis showed on-screen text as an effective query in the CMA block for improved performance.

Conclusion: MM-HSD, leveraging CMA and combining multiple modalities effectively, offers a strong improvement for video-based hate speech detection, highlighting the significance of including on-screen text and inter-modal dependency modeling.

Abstract: While hate speech detection (HSD) has been extensively studied in text,
existing multi-modal approaches remain limited, particularly in videos. As
modalities are not always individually informative, simple fusion methods fail
to fully capture inter-modal dependencies. Moreover, previous work often omits
relevant modalities such as on-screen text and audio, which may contain subtle
hateful content and thus provide essential cues, both individually and in
combination with others. In this paper, we present MM-HSD, a multi-modal model
for HSD in videos that integrates video frames, audio, and text derived from
speech transcripts and from frames (i.e.~on-screen text) together with features
extracted by Cross-Modal Attention (CMA). We are the first to use CMA as an
early feature extractor for HSD in videos, to systematically compare query/key
configurations, and to evaluate the interactions between different modalities
in the CMA block. Our approach leads to improved performance when on-screen
text is used as a query and the rest of the modalities serve as a key.
Experiments on the HateMM dataset show that MM-HSD outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on M-F1 score (0.874), using concatenation of transcript, audio, video,
on-screen text, and CMA for feature extraction on raw embeddings of the
modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/idiap/mm-hsd

### [305] [Collaborating with GenAI: Incentives and Replacements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20213)
*Boaz Taitler,Omer Ben-Porat*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how Generative AI (GenAI) impacts teamwork, focusing on its use in substituting workers and its effect on worker effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the implications of Generative AI on team dynamics, productivity, and decision-making in managerial roles.

Method: The authors use a theoretical framework and simulations. They create a model where managers substitute workers with GenAI and analyze worker effort and optimization challenges.

Result: Findings indicate GenAI can result in workers exerting minimal effort and that the manager's problem is computationally complex. Even less productive workers influence overall team output significantly.

Conclusion: While GenAI offers potential benefits, improper implementation can disrupt team dynamics and productivity. Managers must consider the broader impacts of replacing workers with AI.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping how workers contribute to
shared projects. While workers can use GenAI to boost productivity or reduce
effort, managers may use it to replace some workers entirely. We present a
theoretical framework to analyze how GenAI affects collaboration in such
settings. In our model, the manager selects a team to work on a shared task,
with GenAI substituting for unselected workers. Each worker selects how much
effort to exert, and incurs a cost that increases with the level of effort. We
show that GenAI can lead workers to exert no effort, even if GenAI is almost
ineffective. We further show that the manager's optimization problem is
NP-complete, and provide an efficient algorithm for the special class of
(almost-) linear instances. Our analysis shows that even workers with low
individual value may play a critical role in sustaining overall output, and
excluding such workers can trigger a cascade. Finally, we conduct extensive
simulations to illustrate our theoretical findings.

### [306] [Balancing Profit and Traveller Acceptance in Ride-Pooling Personalised Fares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20723)
*Michal Bujak,Rafal Kucharski*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper explores an adaptive pricing policy for ride-pooling systems that personalizes fares by learning travelers' value-of-time, achieving over 90% accuracy in just 10 days.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of heterogeneity in travelers' value-of-time and acceptable price levels, which are unknown to ride-pooling system operators.

Method: An adaptive pricing policy is proposed that uses daily offers to progressively align with travelers' expectations while learning individual behavioral traits.

Result: The policy achieved over 90% accuracy in gauging pooled travelers' acceptance levels within 10 days and improved utility for travelers and profit for operators.

Conclusion: Learning individual behavioral traits enables operators to optimize fares, attract demand, improve traveler utility, boost profits, and remove inefficient pooled rides.

Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely
compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a
strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable
price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels
can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in
$10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing
policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively
meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results
suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual
travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility)
but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the
operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and
profitable combinations.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper discusses adapting the VisIVO tool for high-performance visualization of astrophysics simulation data on (pre-)Exascale systems. The tool is focused on managing petabyte-scale data more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern astrophysics generates massive data volumes that hamper storage, access, and analysis, necessitating the development of innovative software solutions like VisIVO.

Method: VisIVO is enhanced using containerization and virtualization technologies to improve portability, resource exploitation, reproducibility, and I/O performance on advanced HPC systems.

Result: VisIVO has been successfully integrated with distributed computing infrastructures; enhancements aim to optimize its use across heterogeneous HPC environments while addressing data management challenges.

Conclusion: The improvements in VisIVO are geared towards enabling high-performance data visualization and analysis for cutting-edge astrophysics simulations on complex computing infrastructures.

Abstract: Petabyte-scale data volumes are generated by observations and simulations in
modern astronomy and astrophysics. Storage, access, and data analysis are
significantly hampered by such data volumes and are leading to the development
of a new generation of software tools. The Visualization Interface for the
Virtual Observatory (VisIVO) has been designed, developed and maintained by
INAF since 2005 to perform multi-dimensional data analysis and knowledge
discovery in multivariate astrophysical datasets. Utilizing containerization
and virtualization technologies, VisIVO has already been used to exploit
distributed computing infrastructures including the European Open Science Cloud
(EOSC).
  We intend to adapt VisIVO solutions for high performance visualization of
data generated on the (pre-)Exascale systems by HPC applications in
Astrophysics and Cosmology (A\&C), including GADGET (GAlaxies with Dark matter
and Gas) and PLUTO simulations, thanks to the collaboration within the SPACE
Center of Excellence, the H2020 EUPEX Project, and the ICSC National Research
Centre. In this work, we outline the evolution's course as well as the
execution strategies designed to achieve the following goals: enhance the
portability of the VisIVO modular applications and their resource requirements;
foster reproducibility and maintainability; take advantage of a more flexible
resource exploitation over heterogeneous HPC facilities; and, finally, minimize
data-movement overheads and improve I/O performances.

*Ben Kabongo,Vincent Guigue,Pirmin Lemberger*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces ELIXIR, a lightweight multi-task model combining rating prediction and personalized review generation, addressing explainability issues in collaborative filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative filtering struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and lacks transparent recommendations, making explainability a critical need.

Method: ELIXIR learns global and aspect-specific representations via a multi-task approach, combining rating prediction and personalized review generation using a T5-small model.

Result: ELIXIR surpasses baseline models in review generation tasks on TripAdvisor and RateBeer datasets.

Conclusion: ELIXIR efficiently improves personalized recommendation explainability, outperforming methods relying on larger models.

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose
ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a
multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review
generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of
users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review
generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based
on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based
architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where
state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer
demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models,
especially in review generation.

*Yijia Sun,Shanshan Huang,Linxiao Che,Haitao Lu,Qiang Luo,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPFormer, a Transformer-based framework to handle multi-objective optimization misalignment in recommendation systems, achieving scalable and efficient performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern recommendation systems face challenges due to mismatch between ranking and retrieval optimization strategies, which limits scalability and effectiveness with multiple objectives.

Method: The proposed MPFormer integrates three mechanisms: objective-conditioned transformer for better encoding, dynamic personalized target weights for adaptive retrieval, and incorporation of user personalization into token and model structures.

Result: MPFormer has successfully been deployed in Kuaishou, serving over 400 million users daily, improving user engagement and operational efficiency.

Conclusion: MPFormer effectively addresses multi-objective retrieval issues in recommendation systems, offering scalable solutions with substantial industry benefits.

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of
multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists
between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking
phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the
mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel
multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of
training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent
limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the
MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically
addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First,
an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior
sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation;
second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic
adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is
incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to
further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been
successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably
serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user
daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment
verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively
optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining
service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for
industrial recommendation systems.

*Yongqiang Han,Kai Cheng,Kefan Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper explores multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR) by addressing simultaneous user behaviors and proposes the PDB4Rec model to enhance recommendation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve recommendation performance by integrating multiple types of user behaviors while addressing the challenge of noise in high-frequency behavior data.

Method: Proposes a model called PDB4Rec that extracts and balances information across different frequency bands using a Bootstrapping Balancer mechanism.

Result: Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the model's effectiveness and efficiency in recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: High-frequency information is valuable for capturing user interests' diversity, and the proposed approach enhances recommendation system accuracy by integrating this insight.

Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as
browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation
(MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to
improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some
behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user
interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency
domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These
studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and
reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In
this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means
insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency
corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds
to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our
model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency
bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism
to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance.
Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our model.

*Orion Weller,Michael Boratko,Iftekhar Naim,Jinhyuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper examines the limitations of vector embeddings, notably in realistic scenarios, and introduces a new dataset (LIMIT) to stress-test these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated by the increasing application of vector embeddings for a diverse range of tasks, including reasoning and instruction-following, and the need to examine their limitations in realistic settings.

Method: The study connects learning theory results to show theoretical embedding limitations via k-subsets. It empirically validates these limitations, even with simple queries (k=2), and introduces a dataset (LIMIT) to further stress test models.

Result: The authors found that embedding models face fundamental limitations even on simple queries, as shown through theoretical and experimental analysis on the LIMIT dataset.

Conclusion: Embedding models under the single vector paradigm struggle with certain tasks, urging the need for new methods to overcome these inherent limitations.

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

*Alexandre Andre,Gauthier Roy,Eva Dyer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper identifies fairness concerns in cold-start LLM recommendation tasks due to societal biases and introduces a benchmark for systematic audits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness concerns in zero-context recommendations by LLMs, where societal biases can lead to unfair outcomes.

Method: A modular benchmarking pipeline is introduced to evaluate fairness in LLMs, focusing on sensitive attributes across configurable recommendation domains.

Result: Findings reveal consistent biases in areas like music, movies, and colleges, as well as a non-linear relationship between model size and fairness.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes the importance of systematic fairness audits and nuanced analysis of biases in LLM-driven recommendations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks
due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in
rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only
limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness
concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining.
We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in
zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable
recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and
flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art
models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across
recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and
cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model
size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.

*Jyoti Narwariya,Priyanka Gupta,Muskan Gupta,Jyotsana Khatri,Lovekesh Vig*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes innovative methods to incorporate Large Language Models (LLMs) into session-based recommendation tasks, boosting both retrieval and ranking performance compared to traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current session-based recommendation methods, including lack of semantic interpretation and inefficiencies in prompt-based and fine-tuning LLM approaches.

Method: The paper explores three methods: (1) using LLMs as standalone recommendation agents, (2) utilizing LLMs to initialize deep SR models semantically, and (3) integrating LLMs with data-driven SR models for improved performance.

Result: The combination of LLMs and data-driven SR models outperformed standalone LLM and traditional deep learning models in recall and MRR metrics across experiments on two datasets.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly enhance session-based recommendations, especially when integrated with conventional data-driven models, achieving superior accuracy in retrieval and ranking tasks.

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SR) models aim to recommend items to anonymous
users based on their behavior during the current session. While various SR
models in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they
often fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions
impeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research
has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance
session-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based
methods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to
identify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific
feedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning
methods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant
computational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we
present multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:
(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated
representations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and
(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models. Through comprehensive
experiments on two real-world publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that
LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall values), while
traditional data-driven techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking (high
Mean Reciprocal Rank values). Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with
data-driven SR models significantly out performs both standalone LLM approaches
and data-driven deep learning models, as well as baseline SR models, in terms
of both Recall and MRR metrics.

*Xinhao Huang,Zhibo Ren,Yipeng Yu,Ying Zhou,Zulong Chen,Zeyi Wen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model named SEAL and a dataset called S-DARTS to address issues in retrieving information from long structured documents by incorporating structural features and element-level semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the limitations of existing retrieval methods that do not effectively utilize structural features or datasets with structural metadata.

Method: Proposes a novel framework called SEAL that employs structure-aware learning and masked element alignment. The authors also introduce a new dataset, S-DARTS, with extensive structural annotations.

Result: SEAL showed notable improvements in ranking metrics like NDCG@10, raising performance from 73.96% to 77.84%.

Conclusion: SEAL effectively bridges the gaps in structured document retrieval by utilizing structure-aware learning and providing a new annotated dataset, showing improvements across multiple experiments and industrial applications.

Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune
pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets
lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two
critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and
element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing
structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive
learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic
hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic
discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document
retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on
both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with
online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting
NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3. The resources are available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces two mechanisms, Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE) and Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR), to address scaling issues in multi-domain autoregressive recommendation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling traditional Deep Learning Recommendation Models is challenging, especially in multi-domain scenarios due to computational bottlenecks in attention mechanisms.

Method: The study proposed TAPE for domain-specific positional embeddings and DDSR for dynamic domain state storage, enabling reduced computational load and efficient knowledge transfer.

Result: The approach demonstrates marked improvements in retrieval tasks by separating and combining inter- and intra-domain representations.

Conclusion: The methods provide scalable solutions to improve multi-domain recommendation systems and address computational bottlenecks efficiently.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive recommendation models (ARMs), such as Meta's HSTU
model, have emerged as a major breakthrough over traditional Deep Learning
Recommendation Models (DLRMs), exhibiting the highly sought-after scaling law
behaviour. However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer
architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend
to all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must
efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by
replacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)
Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional
embeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows
attention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the
unnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.
2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state
representation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent
token predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain
information without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a
scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain
recommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval
tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain
representations.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper proposes ReCoGNN, an automated feature augmentation framework using relational signals from multiple relational tables, significantly improving predictive modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate feature augmentation in predictive modeling by identifying and utilizing relational signals, thereby reducing manual effort in AutoML techniques.

Method: ReCoGNN first models intra-table attribute relationships to partition tables, creates a heterogeneous weighted graph to capture inter-row relationships, and uses graph neural networks for message-passing to enhance datasets.

Result: ReCoGNN consistently outperformed existing methods in classification and regression tasks across ten real-life and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: ReCoGNN demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of automated feature augmentation using relational signals, paving the way for its adoption in AutoML workflows.

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores integration of large language models (LLMs) into relational database management systems for enhancing SQL queries but identifies limitations in current implementations regarding output structure, resource optimization, and query planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges and limitations of SQL-invoked LLM integrations found in both open-source and enterprise-level systems.

Method: The authors analyzed two open-source systems and one enterprise platform using five representative SQL queries to identify functional, performance, and scalability limitations.

Result: Three key issues were found: lack of structured output enforcement, suboptimal resource utilization, and inadequate query planning. Initial solutions implemented showed improvements in functionality and efficiency.

Conclusion: Tighter integration of LLMs with database systems is critical for achieving scalable, efficient, and effective processing of LLM-powered SQL queries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as
text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering.
Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly
within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,
open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source
systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to
expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked
LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,
optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented
initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL
queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is
the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

### [319] [Navigating the EU AI Act: Foreseeable Challenges in Qualifying Deep Learning-Based Automated Inspections of Class III Medical Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20144)
*Julio Zanon Diaz,Tommy Brennan,Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper evaluates challenges in adopting DL-based automated inspection systems for Class III medical devices under EU AI Act and existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore regulatory complexities and challenges introduced by the implementation of DL technology in the quality assurance of high-risk medical devices.

Method: The paper conducts a high-level technical assessment of challenges, such as risk management, dataset governance, model validation, and post-deployment monitoring.

Result: Findings highlight differences in regulatory requirements, uncertainties in compliance, data retention burdens, and statistical validation challenges with limited data.

Conclusion: Manufacturers must navigate diverse regulatory frameworks and are advised to consult regulatory and legal experts for compliance strategies.

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) technologies advance, their application in automated
visual inspection for Class III medical devices offers significant potential to
enhance quality assurance and reduce human error. However, the adoption of such
AI-based systems introduces new regulatory complexities--particularly under the
EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, which imposes high-risk system obligations
that differ in scope and depth from established regulatory frameworks such as
the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the U.S. FDA Quality System Regulation
(QSR). This paper presents a high-level technical assessment of the
foresee-able challenges that manufacturers are likely to encounter when
qualifying DL-based automated inspections within the existing medical device
compliance landscape. It examines divergences in risk management principles,
dataset governance, model validation, explainability requirements, and
post-deployment monitoring obligations. The discussion also explores potential
implementation strategies and highlights areas of uncertainty, including data
retention burdens, global compliance implications, and the practical
difficulties of achieving statistical significance in validation with limited
defect data. Disclaimer: This publication is in-tended solely as an academic
and technical evaluation. It is not a substitute for le-gal advice or official
regulatory interpretation. The information presented here should not be relied
upon to demonstrate compliance with the EU AI Act or any other statutory
obligation. Manufacturers are encouraged to consult appropriate regulatory
authorities and legal experts to determine specific compliance pathways.

### [320] [RelAItionship Building: Analyzing Recruitment Strategies for Participatory AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20176)
*Eugene Kim,Vaibhav Balloli,Berelian Karimian,Elizabeth Bondi-Kelly,Benjamin Fish*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper explores recruitment methodologies in Participatory AI projects, identifying challenges and offering recommendations for improved practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the practical challenge of identifying and engaging stakeholders in Participatory AI projects to ensure the AI systems reflect community needs and values.

Method: The paper analyzes recruitment methodologies using a corpus of 37 projects and conducts interviews with five AI researchers to understand outcomes of these methodologies.

Result: The research finds that recruitment outcomes are influenced by work conditions, researchers' goals, and collaboration dynamics, highlighting structural and methodological factors.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided for relationship-focused recruitment methods and reflexive documentation practices to enhance Participatory AI recruitment endeavors.

Abstract: Participatory AI, in which impacted community members and other stakeholders
are involved in the design and development of AI systems, holds promise as a
way to ensure AI is developed to meet their needs and reflect their values.
However, the process of identifying, reaching out, and engaging with all
relevant stakeholder groups, which we refer to as recruitment methodology, is
still a practical challenge in AI projects striving to adopt participatory
practices. In this paper, we investigate the challenges that researchers face
when designing and executing recruitment methodology for Participatory AI
projects, and the implications of current recruitment practice for
Participatory AI. First, we describe the recruitment methodologies used in AI
projects using a corpus of 37 projects to capture the diversity of practices in
the field and perform an initial analysis on the documentation of recruitment
practices, as well as specific strategies that researchers use to meet goals of
equity and empowerment. To complement this analysis, we interview five AI
researchers to learn about the outcomes of recruitment methodologies. We find
that these outcomes are shaped by structural conditions of their work,
researchers' own goals and expectations, and the relationships built from the
recruitment methodology and subsequent collaboration. Based on these analyses,
we provide recommendations for designing and executing relationship-forward
recruitment methods, as well as reflexive recruitment documentation practices
for Participatory AI researchers.

### [321] [FlowMalTrans: Unsupervised Binary Code Translation for Malware Detection Using Flow-Adapter Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20212)
*Minghao Hu,Junzhe Wang,Weisen Zhao,Qiang Zeng,Lannan Luo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve malware detection across multiple ISAs by combining Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs), allowing a single model to analyze malware from different ISAs with reduced training data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing cyberattacks on IoT devices require extending malware detection to multiple ISAs, but labeling malware samples for each ISA is resource-intensive.

Method: The paper leverages NMT to translate malware from one ISA to another (e.g., to X86-64 with sufficient data) and applies Normalizing Flows to enable a model trained on one ISA to detect malware from other ISAs.

Result: The proposed method enables effective cross-ISA malware detection while reducing the burden of dataset collection and labeling.

Conclusion: By combining NMT and NFs, malware detection across multiple ISAs becomes viable with limited data, demonstrating the efficiency and adaptability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Applying deep learning to malware detection has drawn great attention due to
its notable performance. With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks
targeting IoT devices, there is a parallel rise in the development of malware
across various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). It is thus important to
extend malware detection capacity to multiple ISAs. However, training a deep
learning-based malware detection model usually requires a large number of
labeled malware samples. The process of collecting and labeling sufficient
malware samples to build datasets for each ISA is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce the burden of data collection, we propose to leverage
the ideas of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) for
malware detection. Specifically, when dealing with malware in a certain ISA, we
translate it to an ISA with sufficient malware samples (like X86-64). This
allows us to apply a model trained on one ISA to analyze malware from another
ISA. Our approach reduces the data collection effort by enabling malware
detection across multiple ISAs using a model trained on a single ISA.

*Weijie Liu,Hongbo Chen,Shuo Huai,Zhen Xu,Wenhao Wang,Zhi Li,Zheli Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines TEE containers used for safeguarding applications, identifies critical flaws in their isolation strategies, and proposes lessons for improving their security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TEE containers are crucial for protecting applications on trusted execution platforms, but existing solutions exhibit design and implementation vulnerabilities.

Method: Developed and utilized an automated analyzer to evaluate isolation strategies of current TEE containers, identifying their boundaries and checking security robustness.

Result: Identified multiple security flaws in TEE containers, including vulnerabilities like information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks.

Conclusion: Key lessons and insights for creating more secure TEE container solutions were presented, alongside a discussion on future design trends in TEE containerization.

Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a cornerstone of
confidential computing, garnering significant attention from both academia and
industry. To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of
applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as
middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from
potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while
maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation
strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications.
To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an
automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation
boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended
goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information
leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to
guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging
trends in TEE containerization design.

*Lukasz Olejnik*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Small language models can efficiently generate coherent, persona-driven political content, raising concerns about fully automated influence campaigns. Detection and disruption should focus on conversations and coordination rather than restricting model access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how small language models can be used to automate political messaging and assess their impact on ideological extremism and engagement dynamics.

Method: Behavioral experiments were conducted to evaluate the content and responses generated by small language models with persona-driven approaches for political messaging.

Result: Two findings were highlighted: persona has more influence than model identity, and engaging in counter-arguments increases ideological adherence and extremity. Fully automated political influence campaigns are feasible.

Conclusion: Defensive measures against automated influence operations should focus on detecting conversation patterns and disrupting coordination mechanisms, as operational consistency itself leaves detection signatures.

Abstract: AI-powered influence operations can now be executed end-to-end on commodity
hardware. We show that small language models produce coherent, persona-driven
political messaging and can be evaluated automatically without human raters.
Two behavioural findings emerge. First, persona-over-model: persona design
explains behaviour more than model identity. Second, engagement as a stressor:
when replies must counter-arguments, ideological adherence strengthens and the
prevalence of extreme content increases. We demonstrate that fully automated
influence-content production is within reach of both large and small actors.
Consequently, defence should shift from restricting model access towards
conversation-centric detection and disruption of campaigns and coordination
infrastructure. Paradoxically, the very consistency that enables these
operations also provides a detection signature.

*Hyejun Jeong,Mohammadreze Teymoorianfard,Abhinav Kumar,Amir Houmansadr,Eugene Badasarian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Web and Research Agents (WRAs) are susceptible to inference attacks using network-level metadata, exposing user prompts and traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the privacy vulnerabilities of WRAs, especially when used locally for confidential or sensitive purposes.

Method: The researchers built a dataset of WRA traces, designed an attack leveraging network metadata, and assessed its efficacy using a novel behavioral metric (OBELS).

Result: The attack recovers over 73% of prompt information and up to 19 of 32 user traits across sessions, even under noisy conditions. Mitigation can reduce effectiveness by 29%.

Conclusion: WRAs are inherently vulnerable to fingerprinting attacks, but trace obfuscation strategies can partially reduce risks while preserving utility.

Abstract: We show that Web and Research Agents (WRAs) -- language model-based systems
that investigate complex topics on the Internet -- are vulnerable to inference
attacks by passive network adversaries such as ISPs. These agents could be
deployed \emph{locally} by organizations and individuals for privacy, legal, or
financial purposes. Unlike sporadic web browsing by humans, WRAs visit
$70{-}140$ domains with distinguishable timing correlations, enabling unique
fingerprinting attacks.
  Specifically, we demonstrate a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack
against WRAs that only leverages their network-level metadata (i.e., visited IP
addresses and their timings). We start by building a new dataset of WRA traces
based on user search queries and queries generated by synthetic personas. We
define a behavioral metric (called OBELS) to comprehensively assess similarity
between original and inferred prompts, showing that our attack recovers over
73\% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts. Extending to a
multi-session setting, we recover up to 19 of 32 latent traits with high
accuracy. Our attack remains effective under partial observability and noisy
conditions. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies that constrain domain
diversity or obfuscate traces, showing negligible utility impact while reducing
attack effectiveness by an average of 29\%.

*Xia Han,Qi Li,Jianbing Ni,Mohammad Zulkernine*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper highlights vulnerabilities in Google's SynthID-Text watermarking method under meaning-preserving attacks and introduces SynGuard, a hybrid watermarking framework that enhances robustness via semantic and lexical-level embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing watermarking methods (like SynthID-Text) in withstanding semantic-preserving attacks such as paraphrasing and back-translation.

Method: Proposes 'SynGuard,' a hybrid framework combining Semantic Information Retrieval (SIR) and SynthID-Text's probabilistic watermarking. It embeds watermarks at both semantic and lexical levels to maintain robustness and meaning.

Result: SynGuard outperforms SynthID-Text, improving watermark recovery by an average of 11.1% in F1 score across various attack scenarios.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware watermarking, as implemented in SynGuard, offers improved resilience against real-world tampering of AI-generated text. Code and tools are made publicly available for broader adoption and validation.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM watermarking methods such as SynthID-Text by Google
DeepMind offer promising solutions for tracing the provenance of AI-generated
text. However, our robustness assessment reveals that SynthID-Text is
vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks, such as paraphrasing, copy-paste
modifications, and back-translation, which can significantly degrade watermark
detectability. To address these limitations, we propose SynGuard, a hybrid
framework that combines the semantic alignment strength of Semantic Information
Retrieval (SIR) with the probabilistic watermarking mechanism of SynthID-Text.
Our approach jointly embeds watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels,
enabling robust provenance tracking while preserving the original meaning.
Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios show that SynGuard
improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1\% in F1 score compared to
SynthID-Text. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic-aware
watermarking in resisting real-world tampering. All code, datasets, and
evaluation scripts are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cybersecurity measures do not adequately address the novel risks associated with AI systems, necessitating a focus on understanding and mitigating these threats.

Method: The paper explores operational and supply chain cybersecurity risks across the AI lifecycle, highlights previous exploitations, and incorporates insights gained from working in the field.

Result: Key risks and vulnerabilities specific to AI systems are identified, alongside practical examples and expertise to inform improved cybersecurity practices.

Conclusion: Organizations must adopt tailored security frameworks to mitigate evolving cybersecurity threats in the AI-driven landscape, ensuring system reliability and resilience.

Abstract: The rise of AI has transformed the software and hardware landscape, enabling
powerful capabilities through specialized infrastructures, large-scale data
storage, and advanced hardware. However, these innovations introduce unique
attack surfaces and objectives which traditional cybersecurity assessments
often overlook. Cyber attackers are shifting their objectives from conventional
goals like privilege escalation and network pivoting to manipulating AI outputs
to achieve desired system effects, such as slowing system performance, flooding
outputs with false positives, or degrading model accuracy. This paper serves to
raise awareness of the novel cyber threats that are introduced when
incorporating AI into a software system. We explore the operational
cybersecurity and supply chain risks across the AI lifecycle, emphasizing the
need for tailored security frameworks to address evolving threats in the
AI-driven landscape. We highlight previous exploitations and provide insights
from working in this area. By understanding these risks, organizations can
better protect AI systems and ensure their reliability and resilience.

*Dan Lin,Shunfeng Lu,Ziyan Liu,Jiajing Wu,Junyuan Fang,Kaixin Lin,Bowen Song,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BridgeShield is a detection framework utilizing heterogeneous graph attention networks for cross-chain bridge attacks, achieving a 92.58% F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-chain bridges are essential for blockchain interoperability but are prone to hacker attacks due to design flaws and high value.

Method: BridgeShield models cross-chain behavior using heterogeneous graph attention networks, leveraging intra- and inter-meta-path attention for precise detection.

Result: BridgeShield outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a 24.39% improvement, achieving an average F1-score of 92.58%.

Conclusion: BridgeShield is effective in detecting cross-chain attacks and can enhance the security and resilience of blockchain ecosystems.

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges play a vital role in enabling blockchain
interoperability. However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous
value they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing
detection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address
single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address
this gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are
well-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the
complex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield,
a detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain
coordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph
representation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn
fine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path
attention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling
precise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51
real-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an
average F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over
state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of
BridgeShield as a practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and
enhancing the resilience of multi-chain ecosystems.

*Mengyu Sun,Ziyuan Yang,Yongqiang Huang,Hui Yu,Yingyu Chen,Shuren Qi,Andrew Beng Jin Teoh,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Federated Learning (FL) addresses data sharing challenges in medical imaging AI by enabling collaborative model training while preserving patient privacy, benefiting reconstruction and diagnosis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations and data sharing restrictions limit the development of AI models in medical imaging, necessitating alternative frameworks.

Method: The paper surveys Federated Learning applications in upstream tasks (e.g., reconstruction networks) and downstream tasks (e.g., diagnosis/segmentation), emphasizing secure and efficient model training.

Result: FL demonstrated its effectiveness in using fragmented datasets for robust model development without compromising patient confidentiality.

Conclusion: FL is pivotal for advancing medical imaging AI by tackling data-sharing barriers while securing privacy, with potential for future research advancements.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the
realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI
models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets.
This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient
privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization.
These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical
domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated
Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a
new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented
medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of
the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT
or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction
networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity
while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like
tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by
allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.
We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging
pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI
systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align
heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this
paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a
valuable reference for the field's development.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAPTA, a multi-agent system for efficiently assessing web application security by combining large language models and exploit validation, achieving notable success rates on the XBOW benchmark and identifying critical vulnerabilities in real-world usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the scalability issues in security auditing caused by the rapid pace of AI-powered software development, where existing methods cannot keep up with the increasing volume and complexity of code vulnerabilities.

Method: MAPTA integrates large language models with tool-grounded execution and exploit validation to autonomously assess web application security. It operates on benchmarks and real-world scenarios, leveraging cost-effective strategies for early stopping.

Result: MAPTA achieved an overall success rate of 76.9% on the 104-challenge XBOW benchmark. Rates vary by vulnerability type, with high performance on SSRF, injection attacks, and broken authorization. Critical vulnerabilities were identified in popular GitHub repositories, with findings responsibly disclosed.

Conclusion: MAPTA demonstrates strong potential as a scalable, cost-effective solution for web application security auditing in the AI-driven development landscape. It highlights resource efficiency and its ability to identify critical vulnerabilities in real-world applications.

Abstract: AI-powered development platforms are making software creation accessible to a
broader audience, but this democratization has triggered a scalability crisis
in security auditing. With studies showing that up to 40% of AI-generated code
contains vulnerabilities, the pace of development now vastly outstrips the
capacity for thorough security assessment.
  We present MAPTA, a multi-agent system for autonomous web application
security assessment that combines large language model orchestration with
tool-grounded execution and end-to-end exploit validation. On the 104-challenge
XBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieves 76.9% overall success with perfect performance
on SSRF and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, 83% success on broken
authorization, and strong results on injection attacks including server-side
template injection (85%) and SQL injection (83%). Cross-site scripting (57%)
and blind SQL injection (0%) remain challenging. Our comprehensive cost
analysis across all challenges totals $21.38 with a median cost of $0.073 for
successful attempts versus $0.357 for failures. Success correlates strongly
with resource efficiency, enabling practical early-stopping thresholds at
approximately 40 tool calls or $0.30 per challenge.
  MAPTA's real-world findings are impactful given both the popularity of the
respective scanned GitHub repositories (8K-70K stars) and MAPTA's low average
operating cost of $3.67 per open-source assessment: MAPTA discovered critical
vulnerabilities including RCEs, command injections, secret exposure, and
arbitrary file write vulnerabilities. Findings are responsibly disclosed, 10
findings are under CVE review.

*Junjie Chu,Mingjie Li,Ziqing Yang,Ye Leng,Chenhao Lin,Chao Shen,Michael Backes,Yun Shen,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces JADES, a framework to improve the accuracy and consistency of jailbreak evaluations for language models, outperforming traditional methods by 9% in agreement with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current methods in accurately evaluating jailbreak attempts, which often misinterpret results and lack alignment with human assessments.

Method: Developed JADES, a framework that decomposes harmful questions into sub-questions, scores them individually, aggregates the scores, and employs optional fact-checking for hallucination detection.

Result: JADES achieved 98.5% agreement with human evaluators on JailbreakQR benchmark and revealed significant overestimations in success rates of popular attacks.

Conclusion: JADES provides an accurate, interpretable, and consistent solution for evaluating jailbreak attempts, setting a reliable standard for future assessments.

Abstract: Accurately determining whether a jailbreak attempt has succeeded is a
fundamental yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods rely on
misaligned proxy indicators or naive holistic judgments. They frequently
misinterpret model responses, leading to inconsistent and subjective
assessments that misalign with human perception. To address this gap, we
introduce JADES (Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring), a universal
jailbreak evaluation framework. Its key mechanism is to automatically decompose
an input harmful question into a set of weighted sub-questions, score each
sub-answer, and weight-aggregate the sub-scores into a final decision. JADES
also incorporates an optional fact-checking module to strengthen the detection
of hallucinations in jailbreak responses. We validate JADES on JailbreakQR, a
newly introduced benchmark proposed in this work, consisting of 400 pairs of
jailbreak prompts and responses, each meticulously annotated by humans. In a
binary setting (success/failure), JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human
evaluators, outperforming strong baselines by over 9%. Re-evaluating five
popular attacks on four LLMs reveals substantial overestimation (e.g., LAA's
attack success rate on GPT-3.5-Turbo drops from 93% to 69%). Our results show
that JADES could deliver accurate, consistent, and interpretable evaluations,
providing a reliable basis for measuring future jailbreak attacks.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel automated framework to create realistic vulnerabilities in C/C++ codebases for better dataset generation. It demonstrates high success rates in achieving accurate vulnerability injections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in automated vulnerability detection and repair caused by insufficient and low-quality data from traditional methods and AI-driven techniques.

Method: The framework uses multiple AI agents simulating expert reasoning, integrates function agents and code analysis tools, employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and applies Low-Rank weight approximation for efficient model fine-tuning.

Result: The approach achieved 89% to 95% success rates in injecting vulnerabilities at the function level across 116 code samples from three benchmarks.

Conclusion: This novel framework improves vulnerability dataset generation and lays groundwork for scalable, efficient, and accurate AI-driven vulnerability detection systems.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of
cyber-attacks have underscored the critical need for effective automated
vulnerability detection and repair systems. Traditional methods, such as static
program analysis, face significant challenges related to scalability,
adaptability, and high false-positive and false-negative rates. AI-driven
approaches, particularly those using machine learning and deep learning models,
show promise but are heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of training
data. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to automatically
introduce realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++
codebases to generate datasets. The proposed approach coordinates multiple AI
agents that simulate expert reasoning, along with function agents and
traditional code analysis tools. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
for contextual grounding and employs Low-Rank approximation of weights for
efficient model fine-tuning. Our experimental study on 116 code samples from
three different benchmarks suggests that our approach outperforms other
techniques with regard to dataset accuracy, achieving between 89\% and 95\%
success rates in injecting vulnerabilities at function level.

### [332] [Multi-Objective Optimization of ReRAM Crossbars for Robust DNN Inferencing under Stochastic Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05437)
*Xiaoxuan Yang,Syrine Belakaria,Biresh Kumar Joardar,Huanrui Yang,Janardhan Rao Doppa,Partha Pratim Pande,Krishnendu Chakrabarty,Hai Li*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust ReRAM-based hardware accelerator for deep neural network inferencing by addressing stochastic noise issues through two novel methods: ReSNA for noise-aware training and CF-MESMO for efficient multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As ReRAM exhibits promise for DNN inferences, stochastic noise within ReRAM crossbars hinders its accuracy. The motivation is to design a hardware accelerator optimized for accuracy, energy, and area efficiency while addressing inherent noise challenges.

Method: Two primary methods are employed: (1) ReSNA, a noise-aware training methodology to boost DNN accuracy under stochastic noise, and (2) CF-MESMO, an information-theoretic algorithm to identify optimal Pareto solutions by balancing multiple objectives and computation costs.

Result: The ReSNA technique improved inference accuracy by 2.57% (ResNet20, CIFAR-10 dataset). Additionally, the CF-MESMO algorithm reduced computation costs by 90.91% compared to NSGA-II while delivering equally good or better optimization results.

Conclusion: The proposed ReSNA and CF-MESMO methods effectively enhance ReRAM-based DNN hardware accelerators, achieving robust inferencing accuracy and efficient computational trade-offs, thereby pushing the boundaries of hardware design for deep learning.

Abstract: Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is a promising technology for
designing hardware accelerators for deep neural network (DNN) inferencing.
However, stochastic noise in ReRAM crossbars can degrade the DNN inferencing
accuracy. We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance,
area-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust
DNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical
contributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method,
referred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM
crossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic
algorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to
trade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead,
execution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is
that executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is
prohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity
evaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost
by varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost.
CF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that
maximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal
Pareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed
algorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts. On average, ReSNA
achieves 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10
dataset with respect to the baseline configuration. Moreover, CF-MESMO
algorithm achieves 90.91% reduction in computation cost compared to the popular
multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II to reach the best solution from

### [333] [Mixture of Contexts for Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21058)
*Shengqu Cai,Ceyuan Yang,Lvmin Zhang,Yuwei Guo,Junfei Xiao,Ziyan Yang,Yinghao Xu,Zhenheng Yang,Alan Yuille,Leonidas Guibas,Maneesh Agrawala,Lu Jiang,Gordon Wetzstein*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper addresses long video generation as a long-context memory problem by proposing a method to efficiently handle long-range dependencies using a learnable sparse attention module called Mixture of Contexts (MoC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with long-context video generation due to the quadratic cost of self-attention, making memory and computation intractable for long sequences.

Method: The paper introduces Mixture of Contexts (MoC), a sparse attention routing module where queries dynamically select informative chunks and mandatory anchors to attend to, allowing retrieval of salient history with causal routing.

Result: The proposed method achieves near-linear scaling of computational cost, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over several minutes of video content, and enables practical training and synthesis.

Conclusion: MoC demonstrates efficient memory retrieval for long video contexts, leading to consistent and coherent video generation at scale while reducing computational demands.

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces OnGoal, a chat interface that aids users in managing conversational goals by providing feedback, explanations, and progress overviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As multi-turn dialogues with large language models become longer and more intricate, there's a need for tools to assist users in tracking and achieving conversational objectives efficiently.

Method: They developed OnGoal, which integrates real-time LLM-assisted evaluations, explanatory feedback, and visualized goal progression, and compared it against a baseline interface in a writing task study with 20 participants.

Result: Participants using OnGoal achieved their goals with less effort and time while discovering new prompting strategies, demonstrating that goal tracking enhanced their experience and resilience.

Conclusion: The study suggests that tracking and visualization of goals improve engagement, reduce cognitive load, and offer design insights for future LLM-based interfaces to support goal management more effectively.

Abstract: As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and
more complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their
conversational goals? We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users
better manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal
alignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results
with examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to
navigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20
participants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat
interface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and
effort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to
overcome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can
enhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired
design implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal
communication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable
feedback to improve LLM performance.

*Francesco Prignoli,Francesco Borrelli,Paolo Falcone,Mark Pustilnik*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Planner (RA-GTP) for autonomous racing, balancing competitive and compliant motion planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a motion planning approach for autonomous racing that ensures safety, efficacy, and adherence to racing rules like right-of-way and collision avoidance.

Method: The framework employs a Regulation-Compliant Model Predictive Control and models vehicle interactions as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem, solving it iteratively to account for rule-constrained behaviors in planning overtaking strategies.

Result: The RA-GTP significantly outperforms methods with non-interacting or rule-agnostic opponent models, delivering effective and regulation-compliant racing maneuvers.

Conclusion: The introduced framework successfully merges safety, compliance with rules, and competitive motion planning, showing promise over traditional approaches in autonomous racing scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a regulation-aware motion planning framework for
autonomous racing scenarios. Each agent solves a Regulation-Compliant Model
Predictive Control problem, where racing rules - such as right-of-way and
collision avoidance responsibilities - are encoded using Mixed Logical
Dynamical constraints. We formalize the interaction between vehicles as a
Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) and approximate its solution using
an Iterative Best Response scheme. Building on this, we introduce the
Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Planner (RA-GTP), in which the attacker reasons
over the defender's regulation-constrained behavior. This game-theoretic layer
enables the generation of overtaking strategies that are both safe and
non-conservative. Simulation results demonstrate that the RA-GTP outperforms
baseline methods that assume non-interacting or rule-agnostic opponent models,
leading to more effective maneuvers while consistently maintaining compliance
with racing regulations.

### [337] [A Hierarchical Signal Coordination and Control System Using a Hybrid Model-based and Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20102)
*Xianyue Peng,Shenyang Chen,H. Michael Zhang*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical traffic signal control system combining model-based optimization and reinforcement learning, tested in simulations for different traffic demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban signal controls struggle to balance efficient arterial traffic progression with dynamic local intersection demands.

Method: A hierarchical system with three components: a High-Level Coordinator selects strategies, a Corridor Coordinator applies phase constraints, and Hybrid Signal Agents utilize reinforcement learning for real-time signal phase determination.

Result: In simulations, the strategies showed varying effectiveness: MFC excelled under heavy traffic, GWC minimized stops, and PAC improved travel time under moderate demand, offering adaptability.

Conclusion: Hierarchical design ensures adaptive strategy selection and robust performance across varied demand scenarios, enhancing urban traffic management.

Abstract: Signal control in urban corridors faces the dual challenge of maintaining
arterial traffic progression while adapting to demand variations at local
intersections. We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and
control scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement
learning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that
selects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a
Corridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected
strategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC);
and (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via
reinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical
reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train
HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware,
GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their
respective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to
dynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing
corridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed
and evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC
maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes
arterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but
can reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time
in moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand. The hierarchical
design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across
all demand levels.

### [338] [Neural Spline Operators for Risk Quantification in Stochastic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20288)
*Zhuoyuan Wang,Raffaele Romagnoli,Kamyar Azizzadenesheli,Yorie Nakahira*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), a new type of physics-informed neural operator, to better quantify long-term risk in stochastic systems with functional variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for quantifying risk in systems with diverse dynamics often struggle to handle functional variations efficiently. This paper aims to overcome such limitations by proposing a new learning-based approach.

Method: The authors propose the NeSO framework, which uses physics-informed neural operators enhanced with B-spline representations for improved training efficiency and boundary-condition enforcement.

Result: The NeSO framework effectively quantifies risk probabilities in complex systems, demonstrated through case studies involving functional dynamics and multi-agent setups, showing significant speed and accuracy improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: NeSO offers an efficient and accurate approach to risk quantification and has broader applicability to control and PDE-related challenges.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying long-term risk probabilities in diverse stochastic
systems is essential for safety-critical control. However, existing
sampling-based and partial differential equation (PDE)-based methods often
struggle to handle complex varying dynamics. Physics-informed neural networks
learn surrogate mappings for risk probabilities from varying system parameters
of fixed and finite dimensions, yet can not account for functional variations
in system dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce physics-informed
neural operator (PINO) methods to risk quantification problems, to learn
mappings from varying \textit{functional} system dynamics to corresponding risk
probabilities. Specifically, we propose Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), a PINO
framework that leverages B-spline representations to improve training
efficiency and achieve better initial and boundary condition enforcements,
which are crucial for accurate risk quantification. We provide theoretical
analysis demonstrating the universal approximation capability of NeSO. We also
present two case studies, one with varying functional dynamics and another with
high-dimensional multi-agent dynamics, to demonstrate the efficacy of NeSO and
its significant online speed-up over existing methods. The proposed framework
and the accompanying universal approximation theorem are expected to be
beneficial for other control or PDE-related problems beyond risk
quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges posed by unknown and arbitrarily long actuator delays in nonlinear systems, which make traditional predictor feedback controllers analytically intractable.

Method: The authors propose using neural operator mappings to approximate the predictor. The approximation is trained offline and deployed online for fast inference. Stability analysis is conducted using the universal approximation theorem and transport PDE representations.

Result: The method allows for semi-global practical convergence with stability, validated by tests on a biological activator/repressor system achieving 15x speedup compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The paper presents a promising solution to nonlinear system delays by combining theoretical analysis and neural network-based approaches, proving effective convergence and significant computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a rigorous method for implementing predictor
feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long
actuator delays. To address the analytically intractable nature of the
predictor, we approximate it using a learned neural operator mapping. This
mapping is trained once, offline, and then deployed online, leveraging the fast
inference capabilities of neural networks. We provide a theoretical stability
analysis based on the universal approximation theorem of neural operators and
the transport partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the delay.
We then prove, via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, semi-global practical
convergence of the dynamical system dependent on the approximation error of the
predictor and delay bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using
a biological activator/repressor system, demonstrating speedups of 15 times
compared to traditional numerical methods.

TL;DR: The paper describes a data-efficient training framework for segmenting point clouds, focusing on robustness under limited in-domain data using pre-training and various optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of performing robust 3D point cloud segmentation in scenarios with limited in-domain labeled data.

Method: The authors utilize a two-stage training framework: (1) pre-training a convolutional neural network on urban and curated datasets, and (2) fine-tuning a lightweight prediction model on a small in-domain dataset. They also investigate techniques like Point Prompt Training, Manifold Mixup, and histogram-normalized ambients.

Result: The proposed framework increases mean Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and overall accuracy from 85.5% to 90.8%, using only 50 labeled point clouds from the target domain.

Conclusion: Pre-training on multiple datasets significantly enhances generalization, enabling effective segmentation in challenging low-data environments while providing a practical solution for 3D semantic segmentation.

Abstract: In this case study, we present a data-efficient point cloud segmentation
pipeline and training framework for robust segmentation of unimproved roads and
seven other classes. Our method employs a two-stage training framework: first,
a projection-based convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a mixture of
public urban datasets and a small, curated in-domain dataset; then, a
lightweight prediction head is fine-tuned exclusively on in-domain data. Along
the way, we explore the application of Point Prompt Training to batch
normalization layers and the effects of Manifold Mixup as a regularizer within
our pipeline. We also explore the effects of incorporating histogram-normalized
ambients to further boost performance. Using only 50 labeled point clouds from
our target domain, we show that our proposed training approach improves mean
Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and the overall accuracy from 85.5%
to 90.8%, when compared to naive training on the in-domain data. Crucially, our
results demonstrate that pre-training across multiple datasets is key to
improving generalization and enabling robust segmentation under limited
in-domain supervision. Overall, this study demonstrates a practical framework
for robust 3D semantic segmentation in challenging, low-data scenarios. Our

Motivation: Accurate and efficient lung nodule volume estimation in CT scans is critical for early lung cancer detection, yet traditional and existing methods suffer from inconsistency and inefficiency.

Method: The method integrates a multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias correction, trained on 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital.

Result: The proposed method achieved a mean absolute deviation of 8.0% compared to manual regression, reduced error by over 17 percentage points, and had inference times under 20 seconds per scan.

Conclusion: This framework provides a highly accurate, efficient, and scalable solution for lung nodule screening, with significant improvements in error reduction and processing speed for early lung cancer detection.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies
on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional
methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical
approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in
nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a
multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias
correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated
on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a
mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression,
with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms
existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have
errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our
results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold
acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate,

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores using LiDAR in mobile devices like the iPhone 15 Pro Max for background removal, showcasing its independence from lighting conditions and potential as a leading technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing background removal techniques like chroma keying and AI models rely on specific conditions like lighting and subject interaction. The paper aims to address these limitations by leveraging LiDAR's depth sensing capabilities.

Method: The authors integrated the iPhone 15 Pro Max's LiDAR and color cameras with GPU-based processing, using SwiftUI, Swift, and Metal Shader Language to achieve real-time image enhancement at 60 fps.

Result: The technique successfully performs background removal regardless of lighting conditions, though it is limited by the current depth map resolution (320x240) and LiDAR restrictions with certain materials.

Conclusion: Improving LiDAR resolution on mobile devices could make it the leading method for background removal in video and photography.

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile
devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and
compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI
models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and
performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the
LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image
processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and
backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image
enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per
second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming
bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution
to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect
accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device
like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR
could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video
applications and photography.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GENRE-CMR, a GAN-based framework for improved and generalized reconstruction of accelerated CMR images using advanced loss functions and optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of balancing scan time with image quality in CMR imaging, especially across diverse acquisition settings.

Method: GENRE-CMR uses a GAN-based architecture with a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework, incorporating two loss functions: EAR loss for focusing on structurally meaningful regions and SDA loss for regularizing data distributions.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving high SSIM (0.9552) and PSNR (38.90 dB) on unseen data with different acceleration factors and sampling trajectories.

Conclusion: GENRE-CMR provides a reliable solution for high-quality, generalized CMR image reconstruction, making it suitable for clinical deployment across varied protocols.

Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction
remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image
quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We
propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture
employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance
reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative
optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with
residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to
deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions:
(1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on
structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction
blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which
regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric
KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR
surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving
0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various
acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the
contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and
generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for
high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable
deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting atypical mitotic figures in histopathology is crucial for prognosis but is challenging due to their subtle features and variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge aims to benchmark classification methods for this task.

Method: The study fine-tuned the DINOv3-H+ pretrained vision transformer with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and applied extensive data augmentation. The model was initially trained on natural images.

Result: The adapted DINOv3 achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set for atypical mitosis classification.

Conclusion: DINOv3 demonstrates effective transferability to histopathology through parameter-efficient fine-tuning, establishing a robust baseline for AMF classification in the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division
associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to
low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG
2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple
domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision
transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation.
Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology,
achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These
results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when
combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline
for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.

Method: The authors analyze recent benchmarks like MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus to assess the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art LLMs. They then propose a framework based on the concept of the 'augmented mathematician' to integrate these AI tools into research workflows.

Result: The analysis reveals dual capabilities of LLMs: proficiency in solving problems and evaluating proofs, paired with flaws like lack of self-critique and discrepancies in accuracy. A framework with guiding principles demonstrates how AI can aid various stages of the research lifecycle.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that AI's role in mathematical research is optimal as an augmentative tool under human guidance, necessitating skills in prompting, verification, and rigor to fully exploit its potential.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), marked by
breakthroughs like 'AlphaEvolve' and 'Gemini Deep Think', is beginning to offer
powerful new tools that have the potential to significantly alter the research
practice in many areas of mathematics. This paper explores the current
landscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical
research context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of
recent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\'c et
al., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while
state-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and
evaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of
self-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy
and full-proof validity.
  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI
into the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented
mathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical
guidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding
principles for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore
seven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from
creativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these
principles translate into concrete practice.
  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than
automation. This requires a new skill set focused on strategic prompting,
critical verification, and methodological rigor in order to effectively use
these powerful tools.

### [349] [Flexible metadata harvesting for ecology using large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20115)
*Zehao Lu,Thijs L van der Plas,Parinaz Rashidi,W Daniel Kissling,Ioannis N Athanasiadis*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tool utilizing large language models to efficiently extract and unify metadata from diverse ecological datasets, facilitating better dataset linkage and integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face challenges in finding suitable ecological datasets to integrate due to varying metadata standards across platforms.

Method: The authors developed an LLM-based metadata harvester that converts metadata into a unified format using existing metadata standards and employs LLMs to link datasets by embedding similarity and rule-based processing.

Result: The tool accurately extracts both structured and unstructured metadata, identifies links between datasets, and flexibly unifies metadata formats.

Conclusion: The tool aids ontology creation and graph-based searches, improving dataset discovery and integration in ecological research environments.

Abstract: Large, open datasets can accelerate ecological research, particularly by
enabling researchers to develop new insights by reusing datasets from multiple
sources. However, to find the most suitable datasets to combine and integrate,
researchers must navigate diverse ecological and environmental data provider
platforms with varying metadata availability and standards. To overcome this
obstacle, we have developed a large language model (LLM)-based metadata
harvester that flexibly extracts metadata from any dataset's landing page, and
converts these to a user-defined, unified format using existing metadata
standards. We validate that our tool is able to extract both structured and
unstructured metadata with equal accuracy, aided by our LLM post-processing
protocol. Furthermore, we utilise LLMs to identify links between datasets, both
by calculating embedding similarity and by unifying the formats of extracted
metadata to enable rule-based processing. Our tool, which flexibly links the
metadata of different datasets, can therefore be used for ontology creation or
graph-based queries, for example, to find relevant ecological and environmental
datasets in a virtual research environment.

### [351] [Leveraging Large Language Models for Generating Research Topic Ontologies: A Multi-Disciplinary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20693)
*Tanay Aggarwal,Angelo Salatino,Francesco Osborne,Enrico Motta*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to identify semantic relationships in research topics across biomedicine, physics, and engineering. It introduces a dataset and demonstrates performance improvement through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating and maintaining ontologies for scientific disciplines is labor-intensive and often results in uneven coverage, limited inter-domain connectivity, and infrequent updates.

Method: The study assesses LLMs through zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and fine-tuning on a new dataset, PEM-Rel-8K, extracted from widely used taxonomies.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K showed excellent performance in identifying semantic relationships across all tested domains and demonstrated cross-domain transferability.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs significantly enhances their ability to manage ontologies, offering a potential solution to inefficiencies in ontology creation and maintenance.

Abstract: Ontologies and taxonomies of research fields are critical for managing and
organising scientific knowledge, as they facilitate efficient classification,
dissemination and retrieval of information. However, the creation and
maintenance of such ontologies are expensive and time-consuming tasks, usually
requiring the coordinated effort of multiple domain experts. Consequently,
ontologies in this space often exhibit uneven coverage across different
disciplines, limited inter-domain connectivity, and infrequent updating cycles.
In this study, we investigate the capability of several large language models
to identify semantic relationships among research topics within three academic
domains: biomedicine, physics, and engineering. The models were evaluated under
three distinct conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and
fine-tuning on existing ontologies. Additionally, we assessed the cross-domain
transferability of fine-tuned models by measuring their performance when
trained in one domain and subsequently applied to a different one. To support
this analysis, we introduce PEM-Rel-8K, a novel dataset consisting of over
8,000 relationships extracted from the most widely adopted taxonomies in the
three disciplines considered in this study: MeSH, PhySH, and IEEE. Our
experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K yields excellent
performance across all disciplines.

*Vincent E. Castillo*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) powered by LLMs show promise for simulating human behaviors in logistics and supply chain management research but require validation to ensure their equivalence to human decision processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can simulate realistic human behaviors in logistics and supply chain management contexts through generative agent-based modeling.

Method: A controlled experiment involving six state-of-the-art LLMs and 957 human participants in food delivery scenarios, employing tests like Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) for human equivalence and structural equation modeling (SEM) for decision process validation.

Result: LLMs showed surface-level behavioral equivalence to humans but differing artificial decision processes; a dual-validation framework is necessary to ensure reliability.

Conclusion: Generative agent-based models are promising for logistics research but must undergo rigorous human equivalence and decision process validations; the study provides guidance for both researchers and operational applications.

Abstract: Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) powered by large language models (LLMs)
offer promising potential for empirical logistics and supply chain management
(LSCM) research by enabling realistic simulation of complex human behaviors.
Unlike traditional agent-based models, GABMs generate human-like responses
through natural language reasoning, which creates potential for new
perspectives on emergent LSCM phenomena. However, the validity of LLMs as
proxies for human behavior in LSCM simulations is unknown. This study evaluates
LLM equivalence of human behavior through a controlled experiment examining
dyadic customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. I test six
state-of-the-art LLMs against 957 human participants (477 dyads) using a
moderated mediation design. This study reveals a need to validate GABMs on two
levels: (1) human equivalence testing, and (2) decision process validation.
Results reveal GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM; however,
an equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges. While a series of Two One-Sided
Tests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level
equivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial
decision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These
findings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM
with proper validation checks. The dual-validation framework also provides LSCM
researchers with a guide to rigorous GABM development. For practitioners, this
study offers evidence-based assessment for LLM selection for operational tasks.

*Rongwei Liu,Jin Zheng,John Cartlidge*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating Time-series Dense Encoder (TiDE) into Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to address the optimal asset allocation problem, showing superiority over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing asset allocation strategies are constrained by strict assumptions or lack robustness; hence, the study aims to innovate using RL with minimal prerequisites for dynamic financial decision-making.

Method: The study formulates asset allocation as an MDP task, applies RL with the TiDE integration into the DDPG framework, and compares its performance against simpler RL methods and passive strategies.

Result: The DDPG-TiDE framework outperforms discrete-action Q-learning and generates better risk-adjusted returns than a passive buy-and-hold strategy.

Conclusion: The integration of TiDE within the DDPG framework proves effective for addressing dynamic asset allocation problems, making it a promising approach for further research.

Abstract: The optimal asset allocation between risky and risk-free assets is a
persistent challenge due to the inherent volatility in financial markets.
Conventional methods rely on strict distributional assumptions or non-additive
reward ratios, which limit their robustness and applicability to investment
goals. To overcome these constraints, this study formulates the optimal
two-asset allocation problem as a sequential decision-making task within a
Markov Decision Process (MDP). This framework enables the application of
reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms to develop dynamic policies based on
simulated financial scenarios, regardless of prerequisites. We use the Kelly
criterion to balance immediate reward signals against long-term investment
objectives, and we take the novel step of integrating the Time-series Dense
Encoder (TiDE) into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL framework
for continuous decision-making. We compare DDPG-TiDE with a simple
discrete-action Q-learning RL framework and a passive buy-and-hold investment
strategy. Empirical results show that DDPG-TiDE outperforms Q-learning and
generates higher risk adjusted returns than buy-and-hold. These findings
suggest that tackling the optimal asset allocation problem by integrating TiDE
within a DDPG reinforcement learning framework is a fruitful avenue for further
exploration.

TL;DR: The paper introduces QTMRL, a reinforcement learning-based intelligent trading model, combining multi-dimensional technical indicators for adaptive portfolio management. It outperforms traditional models in profitability and risk control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quantitative trading models struggle with dynamic market changes and unexpected events due to rigid assumptions and limited generalization capabilities.

Method: The paper constructs a dataset enriched with technical indicators, utilizing 23 years of S&P 500 data, and employs the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) RL algorithm to design a trading framework and agent.

Result: QTMRL demonstrated superior performance compared to 9 baseline models (such as ARIMA and LSTM) in terms of profitability, risk adjustment, and downside risk control across various market regimes.

Conclusion: QTMRL showcases the potential of reinforcement learning for creating impactful, adaptive, and stable trading strategies, demonstrating significant advantages over conventional methods.

Abstract: In the highly volatile and uncertain global financial markets, traditional
quantitative trading models relying on statistical modeling or empirical rules
often fail to adapt to dynamic market changes and black swan events due to
rigid assumptions and limited generalization. To address these issues, this
paper proposes QTMRL (Quantitative Trading Multi-Indicator Reinforcement
Learning), an intelligent trading agent combining multi-dimensional technical
indicators with reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive and stable portfolio
management. We first construct a comprehensive multi-indicator dataset using 23
years of S&P 500 daily OHLCV data (2000-2022) for 16 representative stocks
across 5 sectors, enriching raw data with trend, volatility, and momentum
indicators to capture holistic market dynamics. Then we design a lightweight RL
framework based on the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm, including data
processing, A2C algorithm, and trading agent modules to support policy learning
and actionable trading decisions. Extensive experiments compare QTMRL with 9
baselines (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, moving average strategies) across diverse market
regimes, verifying its superiority in profitability, risk adjustment, and
downside risk control. The code of QTMRL is publicly available at

*Atit Pokharel,Ratun Rahman,Shaba Shaon,Thomas Morris,Dinh C. Nguyen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a quantum differential privacy mechanism using quantum noise to protect quantum federated learning models during training and communication, with demonstrated trade-offs between privacy and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the vulnerability of quantum federated learning (QFL) to adversarial attacks, particularly focusing on leveraging quantum noise inherent in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for differential privacy (DP).

Method: The authors propose tuning quantum noise parameters, such as measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, to achieve desired differential privacy levels. Simulations are used to evaluate the trade-offs and effectiveness against adversarial attacks.

Result: Simulations show that the framework provides a tunable balance between security (differential privacy) and training accuracy, demonstrating robustness against adversarial attacks through metrics like model accuracy, confidence scores, and attack success rates.

Conclusion: The study presents an efficient quantum noise-based DP mechanism that safeguards QFL processes, offering a practical balance between privacy and robustness, with implications for secure quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) enables collaborative training of quantum
machine learning (QML) models across distributed quantum devices without raw
data exchange. However, QFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where
shared QML model updates can be exploited to undermine information privacy. In
the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, a key question
arises: How can inherent quantum noise be leveraged to enforce differential
privacy (DP) and protect model information during training and communication?
This paper explores a novel DP mechanism that harnesses quantum noise to
safeguard quantum models throughout the QFL process. By tuning noise variance
through measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, our approach
achieves desired DP levels tailored to NISQ constraints. Simulations
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by examining the relationship between
differential privacy budget and noise parameters, as well as the trade-off
between security and training accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate the
framework's robustness against an adversarial attack designed to compromise
model performance using adversarial examples, with evaluations based on
critical metrics such as accuracy on adversarial examples, confidence scores
for correct predictions, and attack success rates. The results reveal a tunable
trade-off between privacy and robustness, providing an efficient solution for
secure QFL on NISQ devices with significant potential for reliable quantum
computing applications.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the capability of LLMs in assisting quantum computing practitioners by ensuring high-quality and executable Qiskit code.

Method: The paper employs a synthetic data pipeline for generating quantum problem-unit test pairs, aligns LLM training with DPO (Direct Preference Optimization), and leverages quantum-verifiable rewards using GRPO (General Reinforcement Policy Optimization).

Result: The combined use of DPO and GRPO techniques enabled the model to outperform open-source baselines on the Qiskit-HumanEval-hard benchmark.

Conclusion: Quantum-verifiable training techniques can significantly improve the performance of LLMs for practical code-writing tasks in quantum computing.

Abstract: Qiskit is an open-source quantum computing framework that allows users to
design, simulate, and run quantum circuits on real quantum hardware. We explore
post-training techniques for LLMs to assist in writing Qiskit code. We
introduce quantum verification as an effective method for ensuring code quality
and executability on quantum hardware. To support this, we developed a
synthetic data pipeline that generates quantum problem-unit test pairs and used
it to create preference data for aligning LLMs with DPO. Additionally, we
trained models using GRPO, leveraging quantum-verifiable rewards provided by
the quantum hardware. Our best-performing model, combining DPO and GRPO,
surpasses the strongest open-source baselines on the challenging
Qiskit-HumanEval-hard benchmark.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Unified Multi-Speaker Encoder (UME), a tool that improves multitask performance for SD, SS, and multi-speaker ASR using shared representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle overlapping speech processing challenges by leveraging inherent task interdependencies in SD, SS, and multi-speaker ASR.

Method: The authors employ the UME architecture, with a shared encoder and residual weighted-sum encoding (RWSE) from multiple layers, jointly trained for three tasks.

Result: UME achieved significant performance gains, including state-of-the-art diarization error rates of 1.37% for Libri2Mix and 2.29% for Libri3Mix.

Conclusion: The proposed UME boosts performance across tasks by aligning multiple semantic levels and reveals potential for multitask learning in speech applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified multi-speaker encoder (UME), a novel
architecture that jointly learns representations for speaker diarization (SD),
speech separation (SS), and multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR)
tasks using a shared speech foundational encoder. We leverage the hidden
representations from multiple layers of UME as a residual weighted-sum encoding
(RWSE) to effectively use information from different semantic levels,
contributing to bottom-up alignment between tasks. This joint training approach
captures the inherent interdependencies among the tasks, enhancing overall
performance on overlapping speech data. Our evaluations demonstrate that UME
substantially improves over the single-task baselines dedicated to SD, SS, and
multi-speaker ASR on LibriMix evaluation sets. Notably, for SD, UME outperforms
the previous studies, achieving diarization error rates of 1.37% and 2.29% on
Libri2Mix and Libri3Mix evaluation sets, respectively.

*Hashim Ali,Surya Subramani,Shefali Sudhir,Raksha Varahamurthy,Hafiz Malik*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) audio spoof detection systems under laundering attacks using a new evaluation database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice-cloning (VC) technology has become increasingly realistic, raising potential abuse concerns, while current spoofing detection systems lack evaluation under adverse conditions.

Method: The authors introduce a novel ASVSpoof Laundering Database and assess seven SOTA audio spoof detection methodologies, examining their performance under various laundering attacks.

Result: SOTA systems demonstrate poor performance, particularly under aggressive laundering attacks like reverberation and additive noise.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for developing more robust spoof detection systems to combat laundering attacks effectively.

Abstract: Voice-cloning (VC) systems have seen an exceptional increase in the realism
of synthesized speech in recent years. The high quality of synthesized speech
and the availability of low-cost VC services have given rise to many potential
abuses of this technology. Several detection methodologies have been proposed
over the years that can detect voice spoofs with reasonably good accuracy.
However, these methodologies are mostly evaluated on clean audio databases,
such as ASVSpoof 2019. This paper evaluates SOTA Audio Spoof Detection
approaches in the presence of laundering attacks. In that regard, a new
laundering attack database, called the ASVSpoof Laundering Database, is
created. This database is based on the ASVSpoof 2019 (LA) eval database
comprising a total of 1388.22 hours of audio recordings. Seven SOTA audio spoof
detection approaches are evaluated on this laundered database. The results
indicate that SOTA systems perform poorly in the presence of aggressive
laundering attacks, especially reverberation and additive noise attacks. This
suggests the need for robust audio spoof detection.

Motivation: To reduce human effort in equipment inspections while ensuring timely preventive maintenance and addressing the cost challenges of traditional sensor approaches.

Method: Implementation of cameras, microphones, and sound-based error detection techniques on 'NS' electric point machines for remote equipment monitoring starting in 2019.

Result: Effective detection of turnout switching errors using sound data with positive test results, facilitating real-time failure detection.

Conclusion: The sound-based monitoring method helps to substantially reduce reliance on manual visual inspections and enhances the efficiency of preventive maintenance systems.

Abstract: Since 2018, East Japan Railway Company and Hitachi, Ltd. have been working to
replace human inspections with IoT-based monitoring. The purpose is
Labor-saving required for equipment inspections and provide appropriate
preventive maintenance. As an alternative to visual inspection, it has been
difficult to substitute electrical characteristic monitoring, and the
introduction of new high-performance sensors has been costly. In 2019, we
implemented cameras and microphones in an ``NS'' electric point machines to
reduce downtime from equipment failures, allowing for remote monitoring of
lock-piece conditions. This method for detecting turnout switching errors based
on sound information was proposed, and the expected test results were obtained.
The proposed method will make it possible to detect equipment failures in real
time, thereby reducing the need for visual inspections. This paper presents the
results of our technical studies aimed at automating the inspection of
electronic point machines using sound, specifically focusing on ``switch
sound'' beginning in 2019.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrated significant robustness and adaptability to synthetic speech challenges.

Abstract: The SAFE Challenge evaluates synthetic speech detection across three tasks:
unmodified audio, processed audio with compression artifacts, and laundered
audio designed to evade detection. We systematically explore self-supervised

configurations for robust deepfake detection. Our AASIST-based approach
incorporates WavLM large frontend with RawBoost augmentation, trained on a
multilingual dataset of 256,600 samples spanning 9 languages and over 70 TTS
systems from CodecFake, MLAAD v5, SpoofCeleb, Famous Figures, and MAILABS.

*Yoshiaki Horiike,Shin Fujishiro*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates how the human brain performs diverse functional computations without significant energy consumption by exploring subtle modifications in the interaction network of brain regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the brain executes complex functions without significant changes in its high energy consumption, despite the extensive computational activity required for such tasks.

Method: Analyzed spontaneous and task-induced brain activity data, examined probability fluxes as measures of state transitions, and modeled interactions using asymmetric Ising spin systems to identify task-independent and task-dependent interaction patterns.

Result: Brain computations correspond to distinct sequences of state transitions; symmetric interactions are strong and task-independent, while task-dependent antisymmetric interactions subtly drive functional computations.

Conclusion: Functional computation in the human brain happens through subtle changes in antisymmetric brain-region interactions, minimizing energy consumption despite complex tasks.

Abstract: The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective
behaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the
recording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks
is expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data.
Thermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by
the brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high
energy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy
consumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not
involved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide
repertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy
consumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by
subtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We
first show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced
whole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the
microscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns
depending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function
is a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the
parameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal
that the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and
task-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and
task-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed
probability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs
its functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction
among the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.

CMS. Recently, end-to-end machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed
to directly optimize physical quantities of interest and to leverage
heterogeneous computing architectures. One such approach, machine-learned
particle flow (MLPF), uses a transformer model to infer particles directly from
tracks and clusters in a single pass. We present recent CMS developments in
MLPF, including training datasets, model architecture, reconstruction metrics,
and integration with offline reconstruction software.

Motivation: To explore how operator learning frameworks can address inverse problems in the computational sciences, with an emphasis on improving accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The paper breaks down various components such as data generation, loss functions, and architectures, highlights end-to-end inverse operator learning, and surveys theoretical and methodological advancements.

Result: The paper identifies challenges like noise in data-driven inversion and discusses structural-aware architectures and estimation techniques for robust solutions.

Conclusion: Operator learning shows significant promise in solving inverse problems directly and efficiently, but dealing with noise and optimizing priors remains critical challenges.

Abstract: Operator learning offers a robust framework for approximating mappings
between infinite-dimensional function spaces. It has also become a powerful
tool for solving inverse problems in the computational sciences. This chapter
surveys methodological and theoretical developments at the intersection of
operator learning and inverse problems. It begins by summarizing the
probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems, and pays
special attention to emerging measure-centric formulations that treat observed
data or unknown parameters as probability distributions. The discussion then
turns to operator learning by covering essential components such as data
generation, loss functions, and widely used architectures for representing
function-to-function maps. The core of the chapter centers on the end-to-end
inverse operator learning paradigm, which aims to directly map observed data to
the solution of the inverse problem without requiring explicit knowledge of the
forward map. It highlights the unique challenge that noise plays in this
data-driven inversion setting, presents structure-aware architectures for both
point predictions and posterior estimates, and surveys relevant theory for
linear and nonlinear inverse problems. The chapter also discusses the
estimation of priors and regularizers, where operator learning is used more
selectively within classical inversion algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of distribution shifts in stock price prediction to improve the accuracy of forecasts.

Method: ReVol utilizes normalization techniques, attention modules, characteristic reintegration, and combines geometric Brownian motion with neural networks.

Result: ReVol outperforms state-of-the-art models, improving IC by over 0.03 and SR by over 0.7 across different datasets.

Conclusion: ReVol effectively mitigates distribution shifts, enhancing stock price prediction accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: How can we address distribution shifts in stock price data to improve stock
price prediction accuracy? Stock price prediction has attracted attention from
both academia and industry, driven by its potential to uncover complex market
patterns and enhance decisionmaking. However, existing methods often fail to
handle distribution shifts effectively, focusing on scaling or representation
adaptation without fully addressing distributional discrepancies and shape
misalignments between training and test data. We propose ReVol
(Return-Volatility Normalization for Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock
Price Data), a robust method for stock price prediction that explicitly
addresses the distribution shift problem. ReVol leverages three key strategies
to mitigate these shifts: (1) normalizing price features to remove
sample-specific characteristics, including return, volatility, and price scale,
(2) employing an attention-based module to estimate these characteristics
accurately, thereby reducing the influence of market anomalies, and (3)
reintegrating the sample characteristics into the predictive process, restoring
the traits lost during normalization. Additionally, ReVol combines geometric
Brownian motion for long-term trend modeling with neural networks for
short-term pattern recognition, unifying their complementary strengths.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ReVol enhances
the performance of the state-of-the-art backbone models in most cases,
achieving an average improvement of more than 0.03 in IC and over 0.7 in SR
across various settings.
