Prior PIM\narchitectures have shown potential to improve energy efficiency and\nperformance. However, such advantages rely on data proximity to the processing\nunits performing computations. Data movement overheads can degrade PIM's\nperformance and energy efficiency due to the need to move data between a\nprocessing unit and a distant memory location. %they face challenges due to the\noverhead of transferring data from remote memory locations to processing units\ninside memory for computation. In this paper, we demonstrate that a large\nfraction of PIM's latency per memory request is attributed to data transfers\nand queuing delays from remote memory accesses. To improve PIM's data locality,\nwe propose DL-PIM, a novel architecture that dynamically detects the overhead\nof data movement, and proactively moves data to a reserved area in the local\nmemory of the requesting processing unit. DL-PIM uses a distributed\naddress-indirection hardware lookup table to redirect traffic to the current\ndata location. We propose DL-PIM implementations on two 3D stacked memories:\nHMC and HBM.

Building upon this foundation, we introduce\nDynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that\nrefines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions\nof subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,\nconsidering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent\naggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets\nyielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively\ncombating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning\nmultiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves\ngeneralization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss\ncurves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of\nDUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization\nperformance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,\nestablishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating\noverfitting in modern deep learning.

We explore the role of visual tokens for\noutput generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to\nformulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and\nefficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive\nmodel finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning\ninformation in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find\nthat the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain\nreference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs\nbetter or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the\npre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a\npractical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper addresses the privacy concerns in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) when handling sensitive visual and textual data, proposing an efficient unlearning framework called CAGUL for Visual Question Answering tasks.", "motivation": "The motivation is to tackle privacy issues in VLMs which may memorize and leak sensitive information during inference, further complicated by the inclusion of visual data.", "method": "The authors developed the Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL) framework, leveraging cross-modal attention to transform low-importance visual tokens and encode unlearning information using external modules.", "result": "CAGUL preserves the reference model behavior while effectively preventing privacy leaks, outperforming or matching finetuning-based baselines without requiring model retraining.", "conclusion": "CAGUL provides a practical and efficient solution for unlearning in VLMs without altering pre-trained parameters, addressing privacy concerns in multi-modal tasks like VQA."}}

To close the gap\nbetween the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,\ni.e., \\textit{R\\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\\'enyi\nentropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss\nHessian.

These models typically rely on two key components: a\nVision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual\ncontent into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end\n-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to\nperform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the\ncognitive core -- the brain of the model.

While most\nexisting works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens\nreceiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus\nto the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from\nViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely\nstudied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these\nViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the\nLLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning.

Existing OS\nalgorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order\nderivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural\ncomponents that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce\nShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based\nagents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'\nlearning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate\nthat LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria\nin competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and\nChicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative\ngames (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).\nOur findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through\ninteraction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent\nLLM research.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores whether Large Language Model (LLM) agents can influence the learning dynamics of co-players in multi-agent interactions through opponent shaping (OS) strategies, introducing a novel method called ShapeLLM.", "motivation": "To address the gap in understanding how LLM agents can engage in strategic behavior to influence other agents' learning dynamics in multi-agent environments, a growing area of importance with the rise of autonomous LLM-based agents.", "method": "The researchers propose ShapeLLM, a model-free adaptation of opponent shaping methods tailored specifically for transformer-based LLM agents, and test it in various game-theoretic environments, including both competitive and cooperative games.", "result": "ShapeLLM enables LLM agents to shape opponents' learning dynamics successfully.
