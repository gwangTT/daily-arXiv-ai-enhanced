### [1] [Learning-Based Planning for Improving Science Return of Earth Observation Satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07997)
*Abigail Breitfeld,Alberto Candela,Juan Delfa,Akseli Kangaslahti,Itai Zilberstein,Steve Chien,David Wettergreen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reinforcement and imitation learning approaches to dynamic targeting in Earth-observing satellites improve sampling efficiency by 13.7% and 10%, respectively, over existing heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance Earth-observing satellites' data collection efficiency by optimizing resources, addressing their inability to easily deviate from trajectories or efficiently direct sensors.

Method: Develop reinforcement and imitation learning methods for dynamic targeting using dynamic programming solutions, then compare their performance against heuristic-based approaches.

Result: Reinforcement learning outperformed heuristic methods by 13.7%, and imitation learning by 10%; both methods required limited data for training.

Conclusion: Learning-based dynamic targeting methods demonstrate superior performance to heuristic approaches, representing a significant improvement in satellite data collection strategies.

Abstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific
information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily
deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of
view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the
spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the
data they collect and include only the most important or informative
measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite
resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently
reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that
dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered
versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different
learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and
imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic
programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our
approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing
the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning
performs on average 10.0\% better than the best heuristic method, while
reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\% better. We also show that
both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts
of data.

### [2] [EnvX: Agentize Everything with Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08088)
*Linyao Chen,Zimian Peng,Yingxuan Yang,Yikun Wang,Wenzheng Tom Tang,Hiroki H. Kobayashi,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EnvX transforms GitHub repositories into intelligent agents that collaborate and interact via natural language using a three-phase process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in manual software reuse from open-source repositories, simplifying integration and boosting collaboration.

Method: EnvX utilizes Agentic AI combining large language models and structured integration across three phases: environment setup, automation, and inter-agent collaboration.

Result: EnvX achieves a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task success rate in GitTaskBench, outperforming alternatives in diverse domains like image and speech processing.

Conclusion: EnvX successfully reimagines repositories as interactive agents, enhancing accessibility, automation, and cross-repository collaboration.

Abstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast
collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains
manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,
understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to
efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that
leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into
intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and
inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories
as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a
three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up
the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned
agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform
real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple
agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with
structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the
entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository
functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18
repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,
document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves
a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming
existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable
multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift
from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,
interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within
the open-source ecosystem.

### [3] [Trust Semantics Distillation for Collaborator Selection via Memory-Augmented Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08151)
*Botao Zhu,Jeslyn Wang,Dusit Niyato,Xianbin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model to efficiently evaluate trustworthiness for collaborating devices using a teacher-student AI architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenges of high overhead and inaccurate trust evaluation in complex computing tasks.

Method: A teacher-student agent architecture where a server-based teacher analyzes trust-related data and transfers task-specific semantics to device-side student agents.

Result: The proposed model reduces evaluation time, decreases resource consumption, and enhances collaborator selection accuracy.

Conclusion: The task-specific trust semantics distillation model improves efficiency and accuracy in trust evaluation for device collaboration.

Abstract: Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is
essential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This
evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from
potential collaborators, including historical performance and available
resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner
independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data
exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in
significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)
model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent
architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful
computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to
multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics
extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving
task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent
transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,
enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation
time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of
collaborator selection.

### [4] [Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning For Continual Embodied Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08222)
*Minjong Yoo,Jinwoo Jang,Wei-jin Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ExRAP framework to improve Large Language Models (LLMs) for embodied instruction following tasks by efficiently exploring and grounding task planning in dynamic environments. It surpasses alternatives in success rate and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable embodied agents to handle continual instruction-following tasks efficiently in dynamic, non-stationary environments, by leveraging enhanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The ExRAP framework combines exploration-integrated task planning and memory-augmented query evaluation. It grounds LLMs in environmental contexts through improved exploration and temporal consistency refinement schemes.

Result: ExRAP shows superior performance in diverse simulated environments, consistently outperforming existing LLM-based planning systems in success rate and efficiency, even with varying instruction scales and non-stationary contexts.

Conclusion: ExRAP significantly enhances embodied reasoning and task execution for dynamic and continual interaction scenarios, setting a high benchmark for LLM-based task planning approaches.

Abstract: This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency
refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of
knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and
CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied
instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and
types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal
success rate and execution efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect music intellectual property and address increasing concerns around music plagiarism in the age of accessible music creation and distribution.

Method: Developed a system for transcription of meaningful musical segments and computed similarity scores using multiple musical features. Also collected a publicly available Similar Music Pair dataset.

Result: The method showed promising results in detecting music plagiarism and demonstrated applicability to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed system is effective for music plagiarism detection and contributes both technical methodology and a public dataset to the field of music intellectual property protection.

Abstract: As a result of continuous advances in Music Information Retrieval (MIR)
technology, generating and distributing music has become more diverse and
accessible. In this context, interest in music intellectual property protection
is increasing to safeguard individual music copyrights. In this work, we
propose a system for detecting music plagiarism by combining various MIR
technologies. We developed a music segment transcription system that extracts
musically meaningful segments from audio recordings to detect plagiarism across
different musical formats. With this system, we compute similarity scores based
on multiple musical features that can be evaluated through comprehensive
musical analysis. Our approach demonstrated promising results in music
plagiarism detection experiments, and the proposed method can be applied to
real-world music scenarios. We also collected a Similar Music Pair (SMP)
dataset for musical similarity research using real-world cases. The dataset are
publicly available.

### [6] [Leveraging AI Agents for Autonomous Networks: A Reference Architecture and Empirical Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08312)
*Binghan Wu,Shoufeng Wang,Yunxin Liu,Ya-Qin Zhang,Joseph Sifakis,Ye Ouyang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a functional implementation of a Level 4 Autonomous Network (AN) architecture, achieving significant performance improvements in telecom networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to advance telecommunications networks from automated systems to genuinely cognitive systems in alignment with TM Forum’s vision for zero-touch, zero-fault operational capabilities.

Method: The study implements Joseph Sifakis’s AN Agent reference architecture, incorporating hybrid knowledge representation and proactive-reactive runtimes. It tests these systems using a case study focusing on Link Adaptation in Radio Access Networks (RAN).

Result: The implemented system demonstrated real-time control in under 10 milliseconds, a throughput improvement of 6% over existing algorithms, and a 67% reduction in Block Error Rate for ultra-reliable services using dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme optimization.

Conclusion: The findings validate the architecture's potential in addressing autonomy challenges, paving the way for adopting Level 4 ANs in next-generation telecommunications.

Abstract: The evolution toward Level 4 (L4) Autonomous Networks (AN) represents a
strategic inflection point in telecommunications, where networks must transcend
reactive automation to achieve genuine cognitive capabilities--fulfilling TM
Forum's vision of self-configuring, self-healing, and self-optimizing systems
that deliver zero-wait, zero-touch, and zero-fault services. This work bridges
the gap between architectural theory and operational reality by implementing
Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functional cognitive
system, deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid
knowledge representation. Through an empirical case study of a Radio Access
Network (RAN) Link Adaptation (LA) Agent, we validate this framework's
transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR
sub-6 GHz while achieving 6% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link
Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 67% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for
ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)
optimization. These improvements confirm the architecture's viability in
overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling
capabilities toward next-generation objectives.

*Prathamesh Vasudeo Naik,Naresh Kumar Dintakurthi,Zhanghao Hu,Yue Wang,Robby Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework designed to efficiently draft regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows, reducing costs and enhancing scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows is costly, time-consuming, low-scalability, and crucial for regulatory compliance. Current methods and large language models (LLMs) face challenges like factual inaccuracies and poor explainability, creating risks in compliance workflows.

Method: The proposed framework integrates specialized autonomous agents for planning, crime detection, external intelligence gathering, dynamic memory management, sensitive data handling, and a real-time validation agent using the Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm. It is still subject to human review in a collaborative workflow.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrates versatility across various financial crime scenarios, improving drafting speed and accuracy, aligning SAR narratives with regulatory standards, and allowing compliance teams to concentrate on analytical duties.

Conclusion: Co-Investigator AI ushers in a new era for compliance reporting, leveraging AI agents to enable scalable, reliable, and transparent SAR generation, while preserving human oversight and domain expertise.

Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a
high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from
factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor
explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains.
This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to
produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with
greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent
advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our
approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,
external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features
dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data
handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge
paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators
remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a
collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We
demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex
financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting,
align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to
focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a
new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI
agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable,
reliable, and transparent SAR generation.

### [8] [TCPO: Thought-Centric Preference Optimization for Effective Embodied Decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08500)
*Kechen Jiao,Zhirui Fang,Jiahao Liu,Bei Li,Qifan Wang,Xinyu Liu,Junhao Ruan,Zhongjian Qiao,Yifan Zhu,Yaxin Xu,Jingang Wang,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO), a method to improve decision-making capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for embodied AI in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with responding effectively to dynamic tasks in embodied AI due to sluggish responses and hallucination issues, which persist after supervised fine-tuning. Current methods, relying on reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought processes, suffer from sparse rewards and low sample efficiency.

Method: TCPO employs a stepwise preference-based optimization approach to turn sparse rewards into richer step sample pairs. It aligns the model's intermediate reasoning process and integrates Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC) for output consistency.

Result: TCPO achieves a 6% improvement over RL4VLM in the ALFWorld environment, with a 26.67% average success rate, addressing model degradation and enhancing task effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of combining preference-based learning with chain-of-thought processes, paving the way for improved embodied decision-making in vision-language models.

Abstract: Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs)
in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains
a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align
with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and
hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating
further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning
and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and
action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,
and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes
Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied
decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based
optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step
sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning
process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by
incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes
consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld
environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%
improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in
mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the
potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT
processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models
in embodied agents.

### [9] [No-Knowledge Alarms for Misaligned LLMs-as-Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08593)
*Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to evaluate the grading ability of LLM judges based on logical consistency between their decisions, avoiding infinite monitoring chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of evaluating LLM judges who assess the decisions of other LLMs, without relying on known ground truth or unconditionally trusting the judgments.

Method: A Linear Programming approach formalizes logical consistency between disagreeing LLM judges, allowing for the detection of misaligned judges based on their response patterns.

Result: The authors introduce 'no-knowledge alarms' that identify when one or more judges fail to meet user-specified grading criteria, with zero false positives.

Conclusion: Logical consistency among judges can be used to evaluate their grading reliability, enabling trust in AI evaluations without relying on infinite monitoring chains.

Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who
or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever
we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want
to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit
the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how
LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only
possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges
disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be
100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear
Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite
test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.
The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or
more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability
requirement.

### [10] [Automatic Failure Attribution and Critical Step Prediction Method for Multi-Agent Systems Based on Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08682)
*Guoqing Ma,Jia Zhu,Hanghui Guo,Weijie Shi,Jiawei Shen,Jingjiang Liu,Yidan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a failure attribution framework for multi-agent systems (MAS) utilizing multi-granularity causal inference, achieving improved accuracy in diagnostics and task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inadequacy of current diagnostic tools for MAS which achieve low accuracy in pinpointing failure causes, impeding practical deployment.

Method: Proposes two key contributions: (1) performance causal inversion with Shapley values for agent-level blame assignment; (2) CDC-MAS causal discovery tackling MAS non-stationarity, creating an automated optimization loop for actionable insights.

Result: Achieved up to 36.2% accuracy in identifying failure steps and increased overall task success rates by 22.4% on standard benchmarks like Who&When and TRAIL.

Conclusion: The framework offers an effective solution to debug MAS interactions, improving reliability and interpretability of such systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

*Shalima Binta Manir,Tim Oates*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Theory of Mind framework combining fast (graph-based reasoning with GCNs) and slow (meta-adaptive learning) systems, validated to replicate human-like adaptive behavior and cognitive biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an AI framework that mirrors human adaptive behavior and reasoning biases by integrating principles from cognitive science.

Method: A dual-process framework inspired by cognitive science, combining graph convolutional networks (System 1) for fast reasoning and meta-learning techniques (System 2) for slower, deliberative reasoning, regulated by a context gate mechanism. It is validated on false-belief tasks and cognitive bias exploration.

Result: The model mirrored human-like behavior in canonical tasks, demonstrated generalization to new contexts, and replicated reasoning biases such as cognitive-load fatigue and framing effects.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges AI and cognitive theory, demonstrating that AI systems can achieve human-like social cognition and adaptive decision-making.

Abstract: We introduce a novel Theory of Mind (ToM) framework inspired by dual-process
theories from cognitive science, integrating a fast, habitual graph-based
reasoning system (System 1), implemented via graph convolutional networks
(GCNs), and a slower, context-sensitive meta-adaptive learning system (System
2), driven by meta-learning techniques. Our model dynamically balances
intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism.
We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically
explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with
dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing
effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our
dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust
generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms
underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and
cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like
social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

*Ziming Luo,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Nihar B. Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates four key failure modes in AI scientist systems, conducting experiments to identify risks and suggesting mandatory access to workflow artifacts for transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks associated with flaws in AI scientist systems that may undermine scientific reliability and trustworthiness.

Method: Controlled experiments were designed to isolate and examine each identified failure mode in AI scientist systems.

Result: Failures were detected in prominent open-source AI scientist systems, with access to workflow artifacts proving more effective for detecting issues.

Conclusion: To ensure transparency and accountability, it is recommended that journals mandate submission of trace logs and code of the AI workflow alongside AI-generated research papers.

Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research
workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold
significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the
internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of
scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,
reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we
identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:
inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc
selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that
isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI
scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist
systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of
severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate
that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far
more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.
We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to
mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure
transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

### [13] [Narrative-Guided Reinforcement Learning: A Platform for Studying Language Model Influence on Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08785)
*Anup Tuladhar,Araz Minhas,Adam Kirton,Eli Kinney-Lang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a platform combining reinforcement learning and narrative reasoning using a dual-system architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems typically treat decision-making and narrative reasoning as separate domains. This paper explores their interaction to understand how narratives could influence reward-based learning.

Method: A dual-system architecture combines reinforcement learning and language model-based narrative frameworks within a configurable gridworld environment for controlled testing.

Result: The preliminary platform reveals how reinforcement learning interacts with narrative frameworks, with logged metrics capturing the system’s reasoning and action selection patterns.

Conclusion: Although in its initial phases, the platform lays the groundwork for studying connections between symbolic reasoning and optimization-based learning in AI systems.

Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative
elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning
(RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make
decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly
been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a
dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence
reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy
that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that
processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide
decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements
while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement
this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive
both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The
platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental
complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement
learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic
decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action
selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a
foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect
reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between
optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper investigates different FPGA designs for a Montgomery Modular Multiplier, optimized for the BLS12-381 elliptic curve, using coarsely integrated operand scanning with a focus on DSP primitive utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a high-frequency, high-throughput FPGA design for Montgomery Modular Multiplication that minimizes resource consumption, targeting applications in Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

Method: Three design approaches were analyzed: Verilog naive (automatic DSP instantiation), Verilog optimized (manual DSP instantiation), and High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Comparisons were made using AMD-Xilinx tools and Alveo FPGA boards following an RTL-HLS hybrid methodology.

Result: The study provides insights into the frequency, latency, and resource consumption trade-offs of each design approach and compares the FPGA implementations to an optimized Rust software equivalent.

Conclusion: Manual DSP instantiation and proper pipelining enable higher frequencies while also reducing resource usage, outperforming other approaches. FPGA-based designs hold competitive potential against software implementations for cryptographic applications.

Abstract: We present the analysis of various FPGA design implementations of a
Montgomery Modular Multiplier, compatible with the BLS12-381 elliptic curve,
using the Coarsely Integrated Operand Scanning approach of working with
complete partial products on different digit sizes. The scope of the
implemented designs is to achieve a high-frequency, high-throughput solution
capable of computing millions of operations per second, which can provide a
strong foundation for different Elliptic Curve Cryptography operations such as
point addition and point multiplication. One important constraint for our
designs was to only use FPGA DSP primitives for the arithmetic operations
between digits employed in the CIOS algorithm as these primitives, when
pipelined properly, can operate at a high frequency while also relaxing the
resource consumption of FPGA LUTs and FFs. The target of the analysis is to see
how different design choices and tool configurations influence the frequency,
latency and resource consumption when working with the latest AMD-Xilinx tools
and Alveo FPGA boards in an RTL-HLS hybrid approach. We compare three
categories of designs: a Verilog naive approach where we rely on the Vivado
synthesizer to automatically choose when and where to use DSPs, a Verilog
optimized approach by manually instantiating the DSP primitives ourselves and a
complete High-Level Synthesis approach. We also compare the FPGA
implementations with an optimized software implementation of the same
Montgomery multiplier written in Rust.

TL;DR: FlexiFlow framework integrates computation directly into disposable products using flexible electronics, optimizing designs for sustainability by considering product lifetimes and carbon footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing integrated into disposable items like food packaging and medical patches encounters unique sustainability challenges due to varied operational lifetimes and deployment scales.

Method: Developed the FlexiFlow framework including (1) workload suite (FlexiBench), (2) optimized microarchitectures (FlexiBits), and (3) carbon-aware models tailored for flexible electronics, validated via tape-out achieving 30.9kHz operation.

Result: Lifetime-aware design showed 1.62X reduction in carbon footprint, algorithmic optimization achieved 14.5X reduction, demonstrated feasibility through silicon tape-out.

Conclusion: FlexiFlow unlocks new possibilities for cost-effective, sustainable, and efficient computing in disposable products, introducing a paradigm shift in extreme edge electronics design practices.

Abstract: We present FlexiFlow, a lifetime-aware design framework for item-level
intelligence (ILI) where computation is integrated directly into disposable
products like food packaging and medical patches. Our framework leverages
natively flexible electronics which offer significantly lower costs than
silicon but are limited to kHz speeds and several thousands of gates. Our
insight is that unlike traditional computing with more uniform deployment
patterns, ILI applications exhibit 1000X variation in operational lifetime,
fundamentally changing optimal architectural design decisions when considering
trillion-item deployment scales. To enable holistic design and optimization, we
model the trade-offs between embodied carbon footprint and operational carbon
footprint based on application-specific lifetimes. The framework includes: (1)
FlexiBench, a workload suite targeting sustainability applications from
spoilage detection to health monitoring; (2) FlexiBits, area-optimized RISC-V
cores with 1/4/8-bit datapaths achieving 2.65X to 3.50X better energy
efficiency per workload execution; and (3) a carbon-aware model that selects
optimal architectures based on deployment characteristics. We show that
lifetime-aware microarchitectural design can reduce carbon footprint by 1.62X,
while algorithmic decisions can reduce carbon footprint by 14.5X. We validate
our approach through the first tape-out using a PDK for flexible electronics
with fully open-source tools, achieving 30.9kHz operation. FlexiFlow enables
exploration of computing at the Extreme Edge where conventional design
methodologies must be reevaluated to account for new constraints and
considerations.

*Chengzhen Meng,Xiuzhuang Chen,Hongjun Dai*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces FASE, a framework for FPGA-based syscall emulation designed to speed up early-stage performance validation for diverse processor designs without requiring full SoC or OS integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the slow validation process inherent in traditional workflows for emerging diverse microarchitectures and AI workloads.

Method: FASE innovates in exposing minimal CPU interfaces, employs a Host-Target Protocol to optimize cross-device communication, and leverages a host-side runtime to manage Linux-style syscalls remotely.

Result: FASE achieves less than 1% performance error with single-thread CoreMark and maintains over 90% accuracy for complex benchmarks compared to full SoC validation, performing 2000x faster than Proxy Kernel.

Conclusion: FASE significantly reduces design complexity and feedback time, and is made available as open-source for widespread adoption.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI workloads and domain-specific architectures has
led to increasingly diverse processor microarchitectures, whose design
exploration requires fast and accurate performance validation. However,
traditional workflows defer validation process until RTL design and SoC
integration are complete, significantly prolonging development and iteration
cycle.
  In this work, we present FASE framework, FPGA-Assisted Syscall Emulation, the
first work for adapt syscall emulation on FPGA platforms, enabling complex
multi-thread benchmarks to directly run on the processor design without
integrating SoC or target OS for early-stage performance validation. FASE
introduces three key innovations to address three critical challenges for
adapting FPGA-based syscall emulation: (1) only a minimal CPU interface is
exposed, with other hardware components untouched, addressing the lack of a
unified hardware interface in FPGA systems; (2) a Host-Target Protocol (HTP) is
proposed to minimize cross-device data traffic, mitigating the low-bandwidth
and high-latency communication between FPGA and host; and (3) a host-side
runtime is proposed to remotely handle Linux-style system calls, addressing the
challenge of cross-device syscall delegation.
  Experiments ware conducted on Xilinx FPGA with open-sourced RISC-V SMP
processor Rocket. With single-thread CoreMark, FASE introduces less than 1%
performance error and achieves over 2000x higher efficiency compared to Proxy
Kernel due to FPGA acceleration. With complex OpenMP benchmarks, FASE
demonstrates over 96% performance validation accuracy for most single-thread
workloads and over 91.5% for most multi-thread workloads compared to full SoC
validation, significantly reducing development complexity and time-to-feedback.
All components of FASE framework are released as open-source.

*Yan Tan,Xiangchen Meng,Zijun Jiang,Yangdi Lyu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoVeriFix, a Python-assisted two-stage framework designed to improve the functional correctness of Verilog code generated by large language models (LLMs) through iterative testing and error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of applying LLMs to generate Verilog code, specifically addressing issues of limited training data and functional errors in existing methods.

Method: The method involves a Python-assisted two-stage framework. First, Python reference models are generated by LLMs to define circuit behavior. Second, these models are used to create automated tests that iteratively identify and correct errors in the Verilog code.

Result: Experimental results show that AutoVeriFix outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of functional correctness and reliability of the LLM-generated Verilog code.

Conclusion: AutoVeriFix successfully enhances the functional accuracy of Verilog code generated by LLMs, addressing both training data scarcity and functional errors, and sets a new benchmark for Verilog code synthesis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating software code for high-level programming languages such as Python
and C++. However, their application to hardware description languages, such as
Verilog, is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.
Current approaches to Verilog code generation using LLMs often focus on
syntactic correctness, resulting in code with functional errors. To address
these challenges, we present AutoVeriFix, a novel Python-assisted two-stage
framework designed to enhance the functional correctness of LLM-generated
Verilog code. In the first stage, LLMs are employed to generate high-level
Python reference models that define the intended circuit behavior. In the
second stage, these Python models facilitate the creation of automated tests
that guide the generation of Verilog RTL implementations. Simulation
discrepancies between the reference model and the Verilog code are iteratively
used to identify and correct errors, thereby improving the functional accuracy
and reliability of the LLM-generated Verilog code. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in improving the functional correctness of generated
Verilog code.

TL;DR: BitROM is a CiROM-based accelerator designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA, leveraging extreme quantization and key innovations to achieve efficient edge-based inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses scalability challenges in CiROM accelerators due to the vast parameter sizes of LLMs, making their deployment inefficient in traditional setups.

Method: BitROM employs a co-design strategy with the BitNet 1.58-bit quantization model. It introduces innovations in ROM array design, accumulator optimization, integrated eDRAM for KV-cache management, and LoRA-based transfer learning adapters.

Result: BitROM demonstrates 20.8 TOPS/W and a density of 4,967 kB/mm2 in 65nm CMOS, achieving 10x area efficiency improvement and reducing external DRAM access by 43.6% compared to prior designs.

Conclusion: BitROM provides a practical path for deploying LLMs efficiently at the edge, overcoming scalability and energy challenges with novel hardware designs combined with advanced quantization techniques.

Abstract: Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory (CiROM) accelerators offer outstanding energy
efficiency for CNNs by eliminating runtime weight updates. However, their
scalability to Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by
their vast parameter sizes. Notably, LLaMA-7B - the smallest model in LLaMA
series - demands more than 1,000 cm2 of silicon area even in advanced CMOS
nodes. This paper presents BitROM, the first CiROM-based accelerator that
overcomes this limitation through co-design with BitNet's 1.58-bit quantization
model, enabling practical and efficient LLM inference at the edge. BitROM
introduces three key innovations: 1) a novel Bidirectional ROM Array that
stores two ternary weights per transistor; 2) a Tri-Mode Local Accumulator
optimized for ternary-weight computations; and 3) an integrated Decode-Refresh
(DR) eDRAM that supports on-die KV-cache management, significantly reducing
external memory access during decoding. In addition, BitROM integrates
LoRA-based adapters to enable efficient transfer learning across various
downstream tasks. Evaluated in 65nm CMOS, BitROM achieves 20.8 TOPS/W and a bit
density of 4,967 kB/mm2 - offering a 10x improvement in area efficiency over
prior digital CiROM designs. Moreover, the DR eDRAM contributes to a 43.6%
reduction in external DRAM access, further enhancing deployment efficiency for
LLMs in edge applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses bilingual language identification (BLID) for distinguishing between Wolaita and Gofa languages, using a BERT-based language model and LSTM, which achieved an F1 score of 0.72.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve language identification in text containing closely related languages (Wolaita and Gofa), which is challenging due to similarities and differences in language characteristics, particularly for addressing multilingual scenarios in Ethiopia.

Method: The paper combines BERT-based pretrained language models with LSTM and experiments with various approaches to optimize performance for the BLID task.

Result: The best-performing method achieved an F1 score of 0.72 on the test set.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrated effectiveness in identifying mixed languages and lays the groundwork for addressing social media challenges and further research in bilingual language identification.

Abstract: Language identification is the task of determining the languages for a given
text. In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language,
particularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification
(BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a
given text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part
of Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and
differences between the two languages makes the language identification task
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on
various approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language
model and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test
set. As a result, the work will be effective in tackling unwanted social media
issues and providing a foundation for further research in this area.

*Debdeep Sanyal,Manodeep Ray,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AntiDote is a bi-level optimization technique designed to make large language models resistant to adversarial tampering while maintaining their overall capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-weight LLMs pose a risk due to potential misuse, like malicious fine-tuning, which compromises safety measures. Current solutions struggle against adversaries with access to full model weights.

Method: AntiDote employs a bi-level optimization process using an adversarial hypernetwork to craft malicious LoRA weights. The defender LLM is trained to nullify these additions while retaining alignment.

Result: AntiDote improves tamper resistance by up to 27.4% across 52 attack scenarios while preserving general LLM functionality with less than 0.5% capability degradation.

Conclusion: AntiDote provides a practical and efficient way to enhance the resilience of open-weight LLMs against adversarial threats, making safety an intrinsic model property.

Abstract: The release of open-weight large language models (LLMs) creates a tension
between advancing accessible research and preventing misuse, such as malicious
fine-tuning to elicit harmful content. Current safety measures struggle to
preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined
adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use
full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we
introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be
resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary
hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender
LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these
adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We
validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,
including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct
weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\% more robust against adversarial
attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially,
this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a
performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\% across capability benchmarks
including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K. Our work offers a practical and compute
efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is a more
integral and resilient property.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MVPBench, a benchmark analyzing the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with diverse human values across various demographics and geographies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation benchmarks fail to address the cultural and demographic diversity needed for globally aligned LLMs.

Method: The authors developed MVPBench, a dataset containing annotated questions and metadata across 75 countries to evaluate LLMs' value alignment.

Result: Disparities in LLMs' alignment performance were found across demographic groups; fine-tuning methods like LoRA and DPO improved their alignment.

Conclusion: Population-aware evaluation is essential for developing culturally adaptive, equitable, and globally aligned LLMs.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations.
However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity,
leading to limited understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally.
In this work, we introduce MVPBench, a novel benchmark that systematically
evaluates LLMs' alignment with multi-dimensional human value preferences across
75 countries. MVPBench contains 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with
fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and rich demographic
metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using
MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic
and demographic lines. We further demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning
methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for
population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for
building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a
practical foundation for future research on global alignment, personalized
value modeling, and equitable AI development.

Abstract: This paper presents the methodologies and results of the NOWJ team's
participation across all five tasks at the COLIEE 2025 competition, emphasizing
advancements in the Legal Case Entailment task (Task 2). Our comprehensive
approach systematically integrates pre-ranking models (BM25, BERT, monoT5),
embedding-based semantic representations (BGE-m3, LLM2Vec), and advanced Large
Language Models (Qwen-2, QwQ-32B, DeepSeek-V3) for summarization, relevance
scoring, and contextual re-ranking. Specifically, in Task 2, our two-stage
retrieval system combined lexical-semantic filtering with contextualized LLM
analysis, achieving first place with an F1 score of 0.3195. Additionally, in
other tasks--including Legal Case Retrieval, Statute Law Retrieval, Legal
Textual Entailment, and Legal Judgment Prediction--we demonstrated robust
performance through carefully engineered ensembles and effective prompt-based
reasoning strategies. Our findings highlight the potential of hybrid models
integrating traditional IR techniques with contemporary generative models,
providing a valuable reference for future advancements in legal information

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciGPT, a domain-specific model optimized for scientific literature, and ScienceBench, a benchmark for evaluating scientific language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face challenges in synthesizing growing scientific literature efficiently, as general models fail to grasp technicality and interdisciplinary nuances.

Method: The authors utilized the Qwen3 architecture and proposed innovations like domain distillation, Sparse Mixture-of-Experts attention mechanism, and knowledge-aware adaptation.

Result: SciGPT demonstrated superior performance over GPT-4o in scientific tasks and showed robustness in unseen scenarios, as validated by experiments on ScienceBench.

Conclusion: SciGPT and ScienceBench provide tools to streamline scientific understanding and improve interdisciplinary research, addressing prior limitations in general-purpose models.

Abstract: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical
bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing,
they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical
jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks,
limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps,
this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific
literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to
evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations:
(1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance
performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention
mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document
reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to
bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in
core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference.
It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its
potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of personalized personas on large language models (LLMs), focusing on false refusal behaviors influenced by sociodemographic factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate and quantify how personalized sociodemographic personas can unintentionally cause biases or false refusals in LLM behavior, especially since these models are increasingly integrated into daily life.

Method: The study analyzes false refusals across 15 sociodemographic personas using Monte Carlo simulations, 16 different LLMs, 3 tasks, and 9 prompt paraphrases, aiming for efficiency and robust quantification.

Result: The results indicate that highly capable models are less affected by sociodemographic personas. However, some personas can still cause false refusals in specific tasks or models, highlighting biases in alignment and safety mechanisms.

Conclusion: Persona effects might be overestimated and could primarily be attributed to other model or task-related factors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily lives
and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended
side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to
falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent
of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15
sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on
false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models,
3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness
classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based
method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show
that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and
less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models,
which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety
mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly
influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings
suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other
factors.

### [25] [Culturally transmitted color categories in LLMs reflect a learning bias toward efficient compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08093)
*Nathaniel Imel,Noga Zaslavsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can replicate human-like semantic systems by achieving near-optimal compression as per the Information Bottleneck principle, especially in color categorization studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can evolve perceptually grounded semantic systems similar to human categorization patterns, specifically in the domain of color systems.

Method: The paper conducts two studies with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct): one replicating English color-naming behaviors and another simulating iterated language learning to examine cultural evolution toward optimal systems.

Result: Gemini aligned closely with native English speakers in color-naming and exhibited high IB-efficiency scores; Llama showed an efficient yet less complex system. In iterated learning, both LLMs evolved random systems toward greater efficiency, mimicking human-like trends.

Conclusion: LLMs display a human-like bias toward semantic efficiency, capable of evolving systems governed by the Information Bottleneck principle.

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human
languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB)
complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for
this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving
efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on
the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization
and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two
influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming
study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native
English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while
Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English.
Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or
actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate
cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated
in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively
restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and
increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These
findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded,
human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that
governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MERLIN is a framework designed to enhance reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in low-resource languages (LRLs), applying a curriculum learning strategy and achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methodologies for enhancing LLM reasoning, while effective for mid and high-resource languages, leave a notable performance gap for LRLs.

Method: MERLIN employs a two-stage model-stacking framework paired with a curriculum learning strategy that sequentially trains from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data, adapting only a small set of parameters known as DoRA weights.

Result: MERLIN achieves significant accuracy improvements, including +12.9 percentage points on the AfriMGSM benchmark against MindMerger, and demonstrates competitive gains on MGSM (+0.9 pp) and MSVAMP (+2.8 pp) datasets.

Conclusion: The framework proves its utility not only in low-resource languages but also extends benefits to high-resource settings, showcasing its adaptable and effective approach.

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex
reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder
methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and
high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN,
a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning
strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts
only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves
exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini.
It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp),
demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

*Nivedha Sivakumar,Natalie Mackraz,Samira Khorshidi,Krishna Patel,Barry-John Theobald,Luca Zappella,Nicholas Apostoloff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bias transfer occurs from pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to adapted models via prompt-based adaptation, undermining assumptions in prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a key assumption in prior research that suggests biases do not transfer from pre-trained LLMs to adapted models, aiming to invalidate this notion.

Method: Researchers assess bias transfer under prompt adaptations using causal models across various demographics and tasks, measuring correlation levels. They also evaluate the effectiveness of prompt-based debiasing strategies.

Result: The study finds strong bias correlation (e.g., rho ≥ 0.94 for gender, rho ≥ 0.98 for age) after prompt adaptation and reveals that current debiasing strategies do not effectively reduce bias transfer.

Conclusion: Bias correction within intrinsic language models is crucial to prevent bias propagation to downstream tasks and bolster reasoning performance.

Abstract: A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer
hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the
BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely
popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In
contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and
that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases
from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and
those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and
tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age
(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we
find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition
parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational
distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several
prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have
distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,
tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and
potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent
propagation of biases to downstream tasks.

### [28] [Verbalized Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08150)
*Supriya Lall,Christian Farrell,Hari Pathanjaly,Marko Pavic,Sarvesh Chezhian,Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes "verbalized algorithms" (VAs), which integrate classical algorithms with LLMs to perform reasoning tasks by breaking them into elementary operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs' one-shot reasoning by leveraging classical algorithms with proven theoretical understanding.

Method: Use verbalized algorithms (VAs) to decompose reasoning tasks into elementary natural language operations, relying on LLMs only for simple, reliable tasks.

Result: The approach demonstrated effectiveness in natural language-based sorting and clustering tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating classical algorithms with LLMs ensures more reliable and interpretable reasoning for tasks like sorting and clustering.

Abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right
answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized
algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established
theoretical understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary
operations on natural language strings that they should be able to answer
reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example,
for sorting a series of natural language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting}
uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting
algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.

### [29] [Balancing Quality and Variation: Spam Filtering Distorts Data Label Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08217)
*Eve Fleisig,Matthias Orlikowski,Philipp Cimiano,Dan Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current methods for annotator filtering in subjective tasks often mistakenly remove annotators who introduce label diversity, leading to suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy and representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure machine learning datasets reflect diverse opinions while effectively filtering out spam or low-quality responses.

Method: Empirical evaluation of annotator filtering heuristics and their impact on label variation, with performance comparisons using synthetic spam data.

Result: Conservative settings for annotator removal (<5%) performed best; current filtering methods often fail to distinguish real annotators from spammers effectively.

Conclusion: Existing spam filtering methods need to be revised to consider label diversity, as spammers are often less random than presumed and metrics treating variation as spam perform poorly.

Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a
population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out
spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and
representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator
filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find
that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single
ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree
instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy
and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal
(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error
from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to
observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than
real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable
from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give
fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of
variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers
tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is
spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that
account for label diversity.

### [30] [Towards Knowledge-Aware Document Systems: Modeling Semantic Coverage Relations via Answerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08304)
*Yehudit Aperstein,Alon Gottlib,Gal Benita,Alexander Apartsin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for understanding how information aligns across documents, termed Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR). It establishes three relation types and uses a QA-based method for their classification. A synthetic dataset benchmarks methods, highlighting that discriminative models perform better than generative ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance computational understanding of how documents share or align information content for applications like information retrieval and summarization.

Method: Developed a framework using QA-based approaches to identify SCR by analyzing answerability of shared questions between texts. Created a synthetic dataset through paraphrasing and controlled omissions from the SQuAD corpus.

Result: Discriminative models, such as RoBERTa-base, outperformed generative models with highest accuracy (61.4%) and balanced macro-F1 scores (52.9%). These findings prove QA's effectiveness in assessing semantic relations.

Conclusion: The QA-based approach successfully predicts and analyzes semantic relations in diverse texts, emphasizing the need for further improvement in model reasoning beyond surface-level data, and resources were released to foster further research.

Abstract: Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the
format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information
retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which
classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We
define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same
information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one
document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic
overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture
these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the
answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic
coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by
paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling
precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark
generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR
prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly
outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the
highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best
balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an
effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse
texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about
information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this
study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates enhancing transparency of automated writing scores with subtrait scoring using generative language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of lacking transparency in automated writing assessment systems, which can obscure understanding of scoring for educators and students.

Method: They prototype an explainability framework and implement subtrait scoring using generative language models, evaluating correlations between human and automated scores.

Result: The findings show modest correlations between human subtrait and trait scores, as well as between automated and human subtrait scores.

Conclusion: This approach introduces a potential method to make automated scoring more transparent, helping demystify scores for end users such as educators and students.

Abstract: Subtrait (latent-trait components) assessment presents a promising path
toward enhancing transparency of automated writing scores. We prototype
explainability and subtrait scoring with generative language models and show
modest correlation between human subtrait and trait scores, and between
automated and human subtrait scores. Our approach provides details to demystify
scores for educators and students.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of low-skill candidates using memorized templates in English language assessments to bypass automated scoring systems and proposes an automated detection system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the problem of test-takers gaming automated scoring systems by using pre-memorized essay templates, which jeopardizes the reliability of high-stakes English language assessments.

Method: The authors introduce the AuDITR (automated detection of inauthentic, templated responses) task and employ a machine learning-based approach to identify such responses.

Result: The study finds that machine learning models can detect these templated responses effectively, although regular updates are needed for consistent performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating and maintaining AuDITR models is essential to ensuring the integrity of automated scoring systems in English language assessments.

Abstract: In high-stakes English Language Assessments, low-skill test takers may employ
memorized materials called ``templates'' on essay questions to ``game'' or fool
the automated scoring system. In this study, we introduce the automated
detection of inauthentic, templated responses (AuDITR) task, describe a machine
learning-based approach to this task and illustrate the importance of regularly
updating these models in production.

*Sergey Pletenev,Daniil Moskovskiy,Alexander Panchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates the use of synthetic toxic data from Large Language Models for training detoxification systems, finding a significant drop in performance compared to human-generated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether LLM-generated toxic data can replace human-generated data for training detoxification models, given concerns about sensitive domains and the limitations of existing LLMs.

Method: Using Llama 3 and Qwen models, synthetic toxic data were generated to pair neutral texts. Models were fine-tuned on this synthetic data and compared to those trained on human-generated data.

Result: Models trained on synthetic data underperformed by up to 30%, owing to a lexical diversity gap in the synthetic toxic data generated by LLMs.

Conclusion: Synthetic toxic data is inadequate for training detoxification models due to limited lexical diversity, underscoring the importance of human-annotated data in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent at generating synthetic
data. However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text
detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community.
This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data
as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for
detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated
synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2
datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data
consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in
performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a
critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small,
repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety
of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in
this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated
data for building robust detoxification systems.

### [34] [Low-Resource Fine-Tuning for Multi-Task Structured Information Extraction with a Billion-Parameter Instruction-Tuned Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08381)
*Yu Cheng Chih,Yong Hao Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ETLCH, a billion-parameter model for structured data extraction, which performs well even with minimal data, offering a cost-effective alternative to large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to make structured data extraction affordable and practical for smaller teams by addressing the high cost of large language models and the challenges of preparing large datasets.

Method: The study develops ETLCH, a billion-parameter model based on LLaMA, fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation using only a few hundred to a thousand task-specific samples.

Result: ETLCH outperforms strong baselines across most metrics and shows significant improvements even in scenarios with very limited data.

Conclusion: Well-tuned small models like ETLCH can achieve stable and accurate results, reducing computational costs and enabling resource-constrained teams to execute data extraction tasks efficiently.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in
domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and
multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams
due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of
preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies
focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on
whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task
conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model
fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand
samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named
entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines
across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the
lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can
deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the
computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction
pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

*Jinzhong Ning,Paerhati Tulajiang,Yingying Le,Yijia Zhang,Yuanyuan Sun,Hongfei Lin,Haifeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) dataset with real human speech samples and proposes an advanced method, RPG-MoGe, for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SpeechRE benchmarks rely on synthetic data and lack diversity, alongside models having limitations like rigid generation templates and poor semantic alignment.

Method: The paper introduces the CommonVoice-SpeechRE dataset with nearly 20,000 diverse speech samples and proposes the RPG-MoGe framework. RPG-MoGe employs a multi-order triplet generation strategy and CNN-based relation prompts for improved cross-modal alignment.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in SpeechRE tasks.

Conclusion: The contributions include a new benchmark dataset and an advanced model, addressing real-world challenges in SpeechRE, with resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets
directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on
synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech.
Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation
templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their
performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a
large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from
diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research.
Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative
Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet
generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element
orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation
prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal
alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an
effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

*Fanzhen Liu,Alsharif Abuadbba,Kristen Moore,Surya Nepal,Cecile Paris,Jia Wu,Jian Yang,Quan Z. Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper provides a comprehensive review of adversarial attacks targeting automated fact-checking systems, categorizing attack methodologies and examining defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the vulnerabilities of fact-checking systems to adversarial attacks which can manipulate claims and evidence, undermining their reliability.

Method: Conduct a survey of adversarial attack strategies, evaluate their impact on automated fact-checking systems, and review recent defense mechanisms.

Result: Categorized existing attack methods and assessed the resilience of current systems, while identifying open research challenges.

Conclusion: It emphasizes the pressing need for robust fact-checking frameworks to maintain high verification accuracy amid adversarial manipulations.

Abstract: In an era where misinformation spreads freely, fact-checking (FC) plays a
crucial role in verifying claims and promoting reliable information. While
automated fact-checking (AFC) has advanced significantly, existing systems
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate or generate claims,
evidence, or claim-evidence pairs. These attacks can distort the truth, mislead
decision-makers, and ultimately undermine the reliability of FC models. Despite
growing research interest in adversarial attacks against AFC systems, a
comprehensive, holistic overview of key challenges remains lacking. These
challenges include understanding attack strategies, assessing the resilience of
current models, and identifying ways to enhance robustness. This survey
provides the first in-depth review of adversarial attacks targeting FC,
categorizing existing attack methodologies and evaluating their impact on AFC
systems. Additionally, we examine recent advancements in adversary-aware
defenses and highlight open research questions that require further
exploration. Our findings underscore the urgent need for resilient FC
frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial manipulations in pursuit of
preserving high verification accuracy.

### [37] [Acquiescence Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08480)
*Daniel Braun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit acquiescence bias, finding instead a tendency to answer 'no.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine if LLMs demonstrate acquiescence bias similar to humans, influenced by their training data and input sensitivity.

Method: Conducted experiments across multiple models, tasks, and three languages: English, German, and Polish.

Result: LLMs predominantly answer 'no,' displaying the opposite tendency of human-like acquiescence.

Conclusion: LLMs do not mimic human acquiescence bias; instead, they show a systematic bias towards negative responses.

Abstract: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in
surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and
documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very
influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on
human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar
tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in
LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and
Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias
towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or
disagreement.

*Pia Sommerauer,Giulia Rambelli,Tommaso Caselli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how persona-prompting in LLMs affects linguistic abstraction and stereotypes in text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the impact of persona-prompting on LLMs' representation of social groups and its influence on stereotypes.

Method: The paper evaluates linguistic abstraction in LLM-generated texts using the Linguistic Expectancy Bias framework, introducing the Self-Stereo dataset and measuring abstraction through concreteness, specificity, and negation.

Result: The study finds limitations in persona-prompting's ability to modulate abstraction and highlights the potential for propagating stereotypes, even when aiming to represent marginalized groups.

Conclusion: Persona-prompting has critical limitations and risks in representing socio-demographic identities, and its ecological validity as a representative tool is questioned.

Abstract: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating
particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified
identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on
how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic
abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short
texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or
non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias
framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting
conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI
assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of
self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three
metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the
limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming
criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic
groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when
seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

*Gautam Siddharth Kashyap,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TrinityX, a modular alignment framework using calibrated routing to optimize help, safety, and truth in language models, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of aligning LLM outputs with the principles of Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty while mitigating trade-offs seen in existing methods.

Method: The method involves a framework called TrinityX, which uses a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) architecture. Specialists are trained for each alignment dimension, and a task-adaptive routing process integrates their outputs into a unified system.

Result: TrinityX demonstrated significant performance improvements on alignment benchmarks: 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score, and 28.4% in truthfulness. It also reduced memory and latency usage over 40% compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: TrinityX is effective in achieving better alignment without sacrificing efficiency, confirmed through ablation and cross-model validation studies demonstrating its potential for general application in LLM development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range
of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness,
Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing
methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,
leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,
limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular
alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)
within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained
experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,
task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,
alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard
alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and
TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,
achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,
and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and
inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation
studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model
evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

*Xue Zhang,Yunlong Liang,Fandong Meng,Songming Zhang,Yufeng Chen,Jinan Xu,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CM-Align, a method to improve the alignment of large language models (LLMs) in multiple languages by addressing limitations in current preference data construction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: English-aligned preference data often lacks consistency and quality when applied across multiple languages, leading to misaligned multilingual performance in LLMs.

Method: The proposed method includes consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual consistency-based multilingual preference data construction.

Result: Experimental results on three LLMs across three tasks demonstrate significant improvement in multilingual alignment using CM-Align.

Conclusion: Constructing consistency-based high-quality preference data is both effective and necessary for improving LLM multilingual alignment performance.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance
gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap,
existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a
reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then
used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that
there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy
multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not
all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low
quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods
usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference
pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data
selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for
improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes
two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual
consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental
results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of
constructing high-quality preference data.

*Dima Galat,Diego Molla-Aliod*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of large language models (LLMs) and ensemble methods for biomedical question answering (QA) without fine-tuning or labeled data. It achieves state-of-the-art performance using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical QA requires precise interpretation of complex and specialized knowledge from extensive evolving datasets, which traditional systems struggle with.

Method: The study uses ensembles of zero-shot LLMs combined with effective information retrieval methods, aggregating outputs from multiple variants to enhance accuracy.

Result: The ensemble approach performed better than individual models and, in some cases, surpassed domain-tuned systems while maintaining generalizability.

Conclusion: Zero-shot ensemble techniques with robust RAG pipelines offer a scalable, practical alternative to traditional fine-tuned QA systems in the biomedical domain.

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the
need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast,
complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large
language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an
ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a
domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge
tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases
rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability
and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method
aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic
and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our
investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance:
while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they
simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These
findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused
retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant
information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our
results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with
effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to
domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper provides the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization by large language models (LLMs) in medical contexts, examining its prevalence, types, and impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the key question of how much medical data LLMs memorize, and the consequences of this for their use in medical applications.

Method: The study systematically analyzes memorization across three adaptation scenarios: continued pretraining on medical corpora, fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and fine-tuning on real-world clinical data.

Result: Memorization is prevalent in all scenarios, more so than in general domains, and categorized as beneficial, uninformative, or harmful.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided to enhance beneficial memorization, reduce uninformative memorization, and mitigate harmful memorization, enabling ethical and effective use of LLMs in medicine.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic
assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.
However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical
training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of
memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it
occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is
memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect
medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:
(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard
medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including
over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The
results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation
scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.
Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and
can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of
clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated
disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,
regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these
findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial
memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,
minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond
surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the
leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new model, OTESGN, to enhance aspect-based sentiment analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results via advanced syntactic and semantic attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aspect-based sentiment analysis struggle with complex semantic relationships and are vulnerable to noisy input, reducing effectiveness in identifying key opinion terms.

Method: The proposed model, OTESGN, employs a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative Attention composed of Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention and Semantic Optimal Transport Attention, combined through an Adaptive Attention Fusion module with contrastive regularization for robustness.

Result: OTESGN outperformed previous models with a +1.01% F1 improvement on Twitter and +1.30% F1 on Laptop14 datasets, demonstrating superior localization of opinion words and resistance to noise.

Conclusion: OTESGN efficiently captures latent syntactic and semantic dependencies, proving effective in addressing noise and improving sentiment analysis performance, as validated on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms and
determine their sentiment polarity. While dependency trees combined with
contextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods
relying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex
semantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails
to capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant
words to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal
Matching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph
Network (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative
Attention. It comprises a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for mining latent
syntactic dependencies and modeling global syntactic topology, as well as a
Semantic Optimal Transport Attention designed to uncover fine-grained semantic
alignments amidst textual noise, thereby accurately capturing sentiment signals
obscured by irrelevant tokens. A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates
these heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves
robustness. Experiments demonstrate that OTESGN achieves state-of-the-art
results, outperforming previous best models by +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30%
F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks. Ablative studies and visual analyses corroborate its
efficacy in precise localization of opinion words and noise resistance.

### [44] [X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S: Automated Discovery of Multi-turn to Single-turn Jailbreak Templates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08729)
*Hyunjun Kim,Junwoo Ha,Sangyoon Yu,Haon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to improve multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) red-teaming with automated optimization of structured prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of M2S red-teaming by automating the discovery and optimization of structured prompts, addressing the limitations of relying on manually crafted templates.

Method: The paper introduces X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated system that uses language model-guided evolution for prompt optimization. It combines sampling from 12 sources, an LLM-inspired judging mechanism, and maintains auditability throughout the process.

Result: The framework achieved five evolutionary generations, discovered two new template families, and demonstrated 44.8% success on GPT-4.1. Cross-model analysis with 2,500 trials showed structural transferability but highlighted model-specific variations and the impact of prompt length.

Conclusion: The study highlights the reproducibility of structure-level search for optimizing single-turn probes and emphasizes the importance of threshold calibration and cross-model evaluation for robust results.

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one
structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written
templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that
discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution.
The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired
by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta =
0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and
44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of
2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by
target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive
coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route
to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold
calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are
available at https://github.com/hyunjun1121/M2S-x-teaming.

### [45] [Streaming Sequence-to-Sequence Learning with Delayed Streams Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08753)
*Neil Zeghidour,Eugene Kharitonov,Manu Orsini,Václav Volhejn,Gabriel de Marmiesse,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez,Laurent Mazaré,Alexandre Défossez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a decoder-only formulation to address streaming multimodal sequence-to-sequence tasks with aligned input-output streams. It offers state-of-the-art performance in tasks like ASR and TTS, achieving competitive latency and accuracy even for long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance sequence-to-sequence learning, especially for streaming and multimodal use cases, by addressing limitations in aligning and processing input-output sequences in real-time.

Method: The DSM framework preprocesses input-output streams to ensure alignment and introduces delays in generation using a decoder-only language model. It does not rely on traditional policies for input-output advancement, streamlining the approach to streaming problems.

Result: DSM demonstrates state-of-the-art results in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) tasks with lower latency while being competitive even with offline baselines.

Conclusion: The DSM framework is versatile for streaming sequence-to-sequence tasks, providing efficient, real-time performance with wide applicability. It is suitable for handling complex scenarios requiring multimodal input-output relationships.

Abstract: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for
streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence
generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the
complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep.
Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for
choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream.
DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language
model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing
appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of
arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to
many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio
streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream
being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We
perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks,
showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while
supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline
baselines. Code, samples and demos are available at

### [46] [Do All Autoregressive Transformers Remember Facts the Same Way? A Cross-Architecture Analysis of Recall Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08778)
*Minyeong Choe,Haehyun Cho,Changho Seo,Hyunil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explored how various Transformer-based language models encode and retrieve factual information, revealing distinct behaviors in Qwen-based models versus others like GPT and LLaMA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance understanding of the mechanisms behind factual recall in Transformer-based language models and assess consistency across architectures.

Method: Researchers performed evaluations across several autoregressive Transformer models (GPT, LLaMA, Qwen, and DeepSeek), focusing on identifying which components were involved in factual recall.

Result: Qwen-based models showed a unique pattern, where attention modules in early layers contributed more significantly to factual recall than MLP modules, contrasting with previous findings on GPT-style models.

Conclusion: Autoregressive Transformers exhibit architectural variations, leading to differing mechanisms of factual association and recall.

Abstract: Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve
factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling
targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has
identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall.
However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different
autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA,
Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded
and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently
from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute
more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within
the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to
fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.

### [47] [Evaluating LLMs Without Oracle Feedback: Agentic Annotation Evaluation Through Unsupervised Consistency Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08809)
*Cheng Chen,Haiyan Yin,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new evaluation method for Large Language Model (LLM) annotations using a student model and CAI Ratio metric in unsupervised settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the quality of LLM-generated annotations is difficult in unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is rare, and traditional methods fail.

Method: The authors propose a student model collaborating with a 'noisy teacher' LLM to evaluate annotation quality using a user preference-based majority voting strategy and introduce the CAI Ratio metric for unsupervised quality measurement.

Result: The CAI Ratio demonstrated strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy across ten datasets and four LLMs, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The CAI Ratio is a valuable tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection when assessing LLMs in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have
significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators.
However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in
dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and
conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy
teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on
oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback
mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate
the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability
of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent
(CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only
quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user
preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the
identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to
ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a
strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential
tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

*Hailay Kidu Teklehaymanot,Dren Fazlija,Wolfgang Nejdl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoVoC, a morphology-aware tokenizer aimed at improving subword tokenization for Geez script languages, releasing datasets and methods for broader research applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subword tokenization often overlooks morphological boundaries, a significant challenge in low-resource languages with morphologically complex scripts like Geez.

Method: The authors propose MoVoC-Tok, a hybrid segmentation tokenizer combining morpheme-based analysis with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens, leveraging supervised morphological data.

Result: MoVoC-Tok improves intrinsic metrics like MorphoScore and Boundary Precision but shows no notable gains in automatic translation tasks.

Conclusion: Morphology-aware segmentation enhances linguistic fidelity and token efficiency, supporting further research in under-resourced languages. The datasets and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological
boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically
complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we
present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train
MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into
the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines
morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological
integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we
curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script
languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed
tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation
quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore,
and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation
in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated
datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research
in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores scalable methods for creating web-based corpora for LLMs in non-English languages. The authors focus on building a 120B token Portuguese corpus, demonstrating the importance of language-specific data preprocessing and selection strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of understanding regarding how to construct effective training corpora for languages other than English motivates this work.

Method: The authors build a 120B token corpus in Portuguese and use continual pretraining to analyze the impact of various data-selection and preprocessing strategies.

Result: They demonstrate performance improvements by employing language-specific data filtering methods, including classifiers for STEM topics and toxic content.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that adapting LLMs to target languages through high-quality, language-specific training data is essential. These methods are applicable to other languages, offering broader insights for multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the
quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work
has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct
effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for
building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token
corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade
corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data
selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when
transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our
findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines,
including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to
the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the
importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study
focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering
insights for multilingual LLM development.

*Joachim Baumann,Paul Röttger,Aleksandra Urman,Albert Wendsjö,Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco,Johannes B. Gruber,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates systematic biases and errors stemming from decisions made by researchers when using large language models (LLMs) for social science research, termed "LLM hacking."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and quantify the risks of relying on LLM-generated outputs for data annotation tasks, given the potential for biased or erroneous conclusions.

Method: The authors replicated 37 data annotation tasks from 21 studies, applying 18 different models and analyzing 13 million labels to test 2,361 hypotheses, exploring the effects of researcher choices on statistical conclusions.

Result: Incorrect conclusions were found in roughly one-third of hypotheses for state-of-the-art models and half for smaller models, highlighting significant risks of LLM hacking even in advanced systems.

Conclusion: LLM accuracy reduces but does not eliminate risks, and human annotation remains critical to mitigating errors. Common correction methods for Type I/II errors are largely ineffective, and intentional abuse via prompt manipulation is alarmingly easy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research
by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and
text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the
implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting
strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic
biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type
I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.
  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks
from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.
Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure
how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find
incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three
hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small
language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and
better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate
models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as
effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of
findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking
mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in
reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,
common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in
reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is
unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,
anything can be presented as statistically significant.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how RL advances reasoning capabilities in LLMs and identify strategies to overcome current scalability challenges.

Method: Survey recent developments in RL applications for reasoning tasks in LLMs/LRMs, especially post-DeepSeek-R1.

Result: Highlights foundational components, problems, and advancements in RL for LLM reasoning while proposing future research areas.

Conclusion: The review aims to foster innovative research on scaling RL to improve reasoning abilities in LLMs and advance ASI research.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for
reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success
in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing
complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has
emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the
rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces
foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in
algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely
to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore
strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence
(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for
reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including
foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream
applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly
evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for
broader reasoning models. Github:

TL;DR: This paper provides a survey on 3D/4D world modeling, establishing definitions, taxonomy, summarizing datasets and evaluation metrics, and addressing open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a fragmented understanding of 3D/4D world modeling with inconsistent claims and a lack of standardized definitions and taxonomies in the field.

Method: The authors develop precise definitions, a structured taxonomy, summarize relevant datasets, metrics, practical applications, and research challenges in 3D/4D world modeling and generation.

Result: This survey categorizes approaches (VideoGen, OccGen, and LiDARGen), organizes the literature systematically, and highlights open challenges and future directions.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a foundational resource for researchers to understand, apply, and advance 3D/4D world modeling technologies.

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of

TL;DR: XFloodNet is a deep-learning framework designed to improve urban flood classification, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with innovative attention mechanisms and refinement techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of urban flooding, which is poorly handled by traditional unimodal and static flood detection methods incapable of capturing complex, dynamic data relationships.

Method: XFloodNet introduces three key components: a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism, a Heterogeneous Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, and a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature Refinement technique for better cross-modal integration, feature prioritization, and robustness.

Result: The proposed XFloodNet framework performed exceptionally well on three datasets, achieving F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60% for Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, respectively, surpassing previous methods significantly.

Conclusion: XFloodNet effectively enhances urban flood detection by solving issues of feature integration, adaptability, and noise resistance, demonstrating superior performance and potential for real-world applications in sustainable city planning.

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

TL;DR: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face challenges in handling finer temporal details due to computational limits. The proposed Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) method leverages multiple inference streams for better processing without increasing training or context window limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge faced by VideoLLMs in handling fine-grained temporal details due to limitations of computational costs and long context lengths, which degrade performance.

Method: The paper introduces Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time method that utilizes multiple parallel inference streams, each processing distinct subsets of video frames, and then aggregates their outputs to enhance performance without additional model training.

Result: Extensive experiments (scales 2B-32B) with benchmarks such as Video-MME and EventHallusion show VPS significantly improves performance, scales better than other parallel alternatives, and complements existing decoding strategies.

Conclusion: VPS offers a memory-efficient and robust approach for improving temporal understanding in VideoLLMs, bypassing context-length limitations while enhancing performance.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses stance detection by integrating multimodal data (text and visuals) using a hierarchical fusion framework to improve classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stance detection models mainly focus on text, neglecting the increasing combination of textual and visual elements in social media content.

Method: A hierarchical fusion framework integrates textual and visual information using a large language model for text summaries, a domain-aware image caption generator, and a transformer module for modality interaction.

Result: On the MultiClimate dataset, the framework achieved 76.2% across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach demonstrates the potential to effectively advance stance detection by leveraging diverse and integrated data sources.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: SBDM is a novel and effective framework for individualized cortical trajectory forecasting, with potential applications in neurodegenerative research and interventions.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

*Rafał Osadnik,Pablo Gómez,Eleni Bohacek,Rickbir Bahia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduced the MCTED dataset for Martian DEM prediction, made suitable for machine learning applications, along with open-source data and tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in processing Martian DEM data and develop a comprehensive dataset suitable for elevation prediction tasks.

Method: Created MCTED dataset using high-resolution orthographic imagery and elevation data from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, complemented by tools to manage artefacts and missing data.

Result: Developed MCTED dataset with 80,898 samples, conducted comparative analysis using U-Net and DepthAnythingV2, highlighting the advantages of the small architecture.

Conclusion: MCTED dataset enhances Martian DEM prediction, outperforms general depth estimation models in focused tasks, and is openly available for research and applications.

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

### [59] [APML: Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss for Robust 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08104)
*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Mohammad Sabokrou,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a novel approach for point cloud prediction tasks that approximates one-to-one matching effectively and efficiently using Sinkhorn iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing loss functions like Chamfer Distance and Earth Mover Distance have limitations in handling spatial distributions and computational efficiency, affecting model performance.

Method: The authors propose APML, leveraging Sinkhorn iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix to approximate one-to-one matching, ensuring minimum assignment probability while being computationally efficient.

Result: APML demonstrates faster convergence, better spatial distributions (particularly in low-density regions), and improved or comparable quantitative performance in various deep-learning architectures and benchmarks.

Conclusion: APML offers a scalable and differentiable loss function for point cloud prediction tasks, enabling efficient and precise modeling. It improves outcomes without requiring additional hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

### [60] [Lightweight Deep Unfolding Networks with Enhanced Robustness for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08205)
*Jingjing Liu,Yinchao Han,Xianchao Xiu,Jianhua Zhang,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight framework, L-RPCANet, for infrared small target detection (ISTD), leveraging robust principal component analysis (RPCA) and a channel-wise approach to achieve noise robustness and reduced network parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ISTD methods face issues with parameter lightweightness and noise robustness despite leveraging deep unfolding networks.

Method: Hierarchical bottleneck structures refine features, reduce channel dimensions, and embed noise reduction modules with squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) for effective feature attention.

Result: Experimental validation has shown that L-RPCANet outperforms contemporary methods like RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++ on ISTD datasets.

Conclusion: L-RPCANet is an efficient, lightweight, and robust alternative for ISTD, offering performance superiority with reduced computational complexity.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

### [61] [Sparse Transformer for Ultra-sparse Sampled Video Compressive Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08228)
*Miao Cao,Siming Zheng,Lishun Wang,Ziyang Chen,David Brady,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) approach to improve energy efficiency and video frame recovery in digital cameras, supported by the innovative BSTFormer model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing pixel density and frame rates in digital cameras result in unsustainable power demands, necessitating more energy-efficient methods.

Method: The authors propose USS, leveraging Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding and the BSTFormer model applying sparse TransFormers for recovering high-speed frames.

Result: USS measurement coupled with BSTFormer demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art algorithms across simulated and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: USS is effective in reducing power consumption, offers a higher dynamic range, and is feasible for implementation in complete video SCI systems on chip.

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GTA-Crime, a synthetic dataset and framework for improving video anomaly detection of fatal incidents using data generated in GTA5 and proposes a snippet-level domain adaptation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting fatal incidents like shootings and stabbings in surveillance videos is challenging due to their rarity and ethical concerns in real-world data collection.

Method: The authors developed a dataset in GTA5 featuring fatal situations captured from diverse CCTV perspectives, alongside a video generation framework and a snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training.

Result: Incorporating GTA-Crime and the domain adaptation strategy improves the accuracy of fatal violence detection in real-world datasets, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: The study provides an ethical and accessible solution for addressing data scarcity in detecting fatal incidents, with the dataset and framework enhancing detection technologies and being made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

*Faisal Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RepViT-CXR, a novel method to adapt single-channel grayscale chest X-rays for Vision Transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tuberculosis and pneumonia detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the grayscale nature of chest X-rays and the need for three-channel inputs required by Vision Transformers, enabling more effective deep learning applications in medical imaging.

Method: The authors developed a channel replication strategy, RepViT-CXR, which transforms grayscale CXR images into a compatible three-channel format for Vision Transformers, without additional information loss.

Result: RepViT-CXR achieved state-of-the-art accuracy and AUC across three datasets: 99.9% accuracy and AUC on TB-CXR, 99.0% accuracy and AUC on Pediatric Pneumonia, and 91.1% accuracy and AUC on Shenzhen TB.

Conclusion: RepViT-CXR demonstrates that a simple channel replication strategy enables Vision Transformers to excel in grayscale medical image tasks, setting a new benchmark for chest X-ray analysis and paving the way for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

*Zheng Yang,Yanteng Zhang,Xupeng Kou,Yang Liu,Chao Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new AI model, combining 3D CNN and Symmetry Interactive Transformer (SIT), to improve Alzheimer's disease detection by focusing on brain asymmetry caused by left and right hemisphere atrophy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Alzheimer’s diagnostic models often ignore asymmetrical brain changes caused by the disease. The authors aimed to improve diagnostic accuracy by addressing these asymmetries effectively.

Method: The paper presents an end-to-end model that includes a 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive Transformer. Features of the left and right brain hemispheres are aligned for further asymmetry-focused analysis.

Result: The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 92.5% on the ADNI dataset, outperforming CNN-only models and CNN-Transformer hybrids. It also showed a strong focus on brain regions affected by asymmetric atrophy.

Conclusion: The approach not only improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances interpretability by targeting regions impacted by Alzheimer’s-related brain asymmetry, proving its effectiveness.

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EVDI++, a self-supervised framework that uses event cameras to tackle motion blur and predict intermediate frames, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frame-based cameras struggle with motion blur and information loss during extended exposure times, necessitating methods to improve video quality.

Method: EVDI++ employs the Learnable Double Integral (LDI) network for deblurring and intermediate frame prediction, refining results via a division reconstruction module and adaptive fusion strategy. It uses self-supervised learning with real-world blurry videos and event data.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate EVDI++'s superior performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

Conclusion: EVDI++ effectively enhances video quality by leveraging event cameras to mitigate motion blur, showing its applicability and generalizability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyMamba proposes a novel hyperspectral object tracking method leveraging spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling to enhance performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyperspectral trackers fail to adequately capture intrinsic spectral data, temporal dependencies, and cross-depth interactions that are crucial for robust tracking.

Method: HyMamba introduces the Spectral State Integration (SSI) module for progressive refinement of spectral features and incorporates Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) modules for synchronous spatial-spectral learning through state space systems.

Result: HyMamba achieves top-tier results on seven benchmark datasets, including an AUC score of 73.0% and DP@20 score of 96.3% on the HOTC2020 dataset.

Conclusion: HyMamba's innovative design integrating spectral, depth, and temporal aspects proves highly effective for hyperspectral object tracking, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

*Saurav Sengupta,Nazanin Moradinasab,Jiebei Liu,Donald E. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies how Vision Language Models (VLMs) rely on biases during question answering and introduces a framework to systematically evaluate input data characteristics affecting their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding VLM biases is essential as these models fail to accurately answer questions that require focus on specific image details, particularly when relying on inherent biases rather than visual evidence.

Method: The researchers developed a systematic framework to examine how changes in input data (image and prompts) impact VLM performance, and analyzed attention values across varying parameters using open-source models.

Result: The study found that minor modifications in image features and prompt specificity cause significant changes in VLM's answers and overall accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of considering input variability and bias in improving the reliability of VLMs for tasks requiring detailed visual analysis.

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

*Hyeonseok Kim,Byeongkeun Kang,Yeejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'E3DPC-GZSL,' a novel method for generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds, addressing biases toward seen classes and improving performance on unseen classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D semantic segmentation models are biased towards seen classes, due to limited training data, and struggle with generalized zero-shot learning tasks.

Method: The method integrates an evidence-based uncertainty estimator into the classifier for dynamic prediction calibration and refines the semantic space by combining learnable parameters with text-based features for better unseen class optimization.

Result: E3DPC-GZSL demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on 3D semantic segmentation datasets like ScanNet v2 and S3DIS, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: By introducing improved uncertainty estimation and semantic space refinement, the method effectively reduces prediction bias and enhances capabilities in recognizing unseen classes in 3D point clouds.

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

*Yuelin Guo,Haoyu He,Zhiyuan Chen,Zitong Huang,Renhao Lu,Lu Shi,Zejun Wang,Weizhe Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses key limitations in weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) and introduces new methods to improve performance, including a novel proposal selector, network architecture, and loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSOD is attractive due to not requiring box-level annotations, but current approaches fail in capturing full object extents, distinguishing adjacent intra-class objects, bridging semantic gaps, and optimizing ignored proposals efficiently.

Method: The authors propose a Heatmap-Guided Proposal Selector algorithm, a Weakly Supervised Basic Detection Network, and a Negative Certainty Supervision loss to address challenges in proposal selection, semantic representation, and optimization efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate improved performance, achieving mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and 55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, outperforming state-of-the-art WSOD methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing WSOD methods, improves performance on standard benchmarks, and makes the code publicly available to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Result: The dataset provides polygon-based annotations across agro-ecological zones, differentiates planting stages, and offers suitability for training neural networks and foundation models.

Conclusion: The dataset contributes to transparent monitoring of oil palm expansion, supports deforestation reduction goals, and adheres to FAIR data principles.

Abstract: Oil palm cultivation remains one of the leading causes of deforestation in
Indonesia. To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable
mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory
frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm
plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert
labeling of high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 to 2024. The dataset
provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of
agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes
oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was
ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset
was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it
suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural
networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY
license, it fills a key gap in training data for remote sensing and aims to
improve the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent
monitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global
deforestation reduction goals and follows FAIR data principles.

*Rongsheng Wang,Fenghe Tang,Qingsong Yao,Rui Yan,Xu Zhang,Zhen Huang,Haoran Lai,Zhiyang He,Xiaodong Tao,Zihang Jiang,Shaohua Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Similarity-Driven Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) to improve radiograph interpretation, particularly in CT scans with sparse and intricate structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical vision-language models underperform in interpreting spatially sparse lesion structures in CT scans and addressing the implicit relationships between pathological descriptions and corresponding sub-regions in radiographs.

Method: The authors use multi-modal masked modeling for precise semantic understanding, similarity-driven alignment to adaptively map sentences to correct radiograph patches, and a cross-granularity fusion module for multi-level multimodal integration.

Result: SimCroP, pre-trained on a large paired CT-reports dataset, significantly enhances performance in image classification and segmentation over five public datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The innovative SimCroP framework proves highly effective for radiograph interpretation by addressing core challenges in CT scan analysis, reinforcing its relevance for medical downstream tasks.

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

### [72] [Boosted Training of Lightweight Early Exits for Optimizing CNN Image Classification Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08318)
*Yehudit Aperstein,Alexander Apartsin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE) that improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs in early-exit image classification for resource-constrained systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficacy of early-exit strategies in real-time image classification stemming from a mismatch between training and inference data distributions, limiting their effectiveness in resource-constrained environments.

Method: The authors propose BTS-EE, a sequential training scheme that aligns intermediate branch training with inference distributions. Additionally, they introduce lightweight 1D convolution-based branches and a Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method for fine-tuning exit decisions.

Result: Experimental results on the CINIC-10 dataset using a ResNet18 backbone show BTS-EE achieves up to a 45% reduction in computation power with only a 2% degradation in accuracy.

Conclusion: BTS-EE enhances the trade-offs between computation efficiency and accuracy, supporting real-time deployment of CNNs in applications like industrial inspection and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

*Jihyun Moon,Charmgil Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a retrieval-augmented vision-language model (VLM) framework that enhances melanoma diagnosis by incorporating semantically similar patient cases, achieving better accuracy without fine-tuning and surpassing traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional neural networks often neglect metadata and require preprocessing, while traditional vision-language models fail to capture clinical specificity. Better diagnostic methods are needed.

Method: A retrieval-augmented VLM framework is used, incorporating semantically relevant patient cases directly into the model's diagnostic prompts to improve predictions.

Result: The proposed method significantly boosts classification accuracy and error correction compared to conventional baselines.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented prompting is a promising clinical decision support strategy for melanoma diagnosis, providing informed predictions without model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

TL;DR: InsFusion is a method enhancing 3D object detection by addressing accumulated errors during feature extraction and fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the noise and errors that accumulate during feature extraction, perspective transformation, and feature fusion in multi-view cameras and LiDAR systems.

Method: Proposing InsFusion, extracting proposals from raw and fused features, utilizing attention mechanisms to refine and query raw features.

Result: InsFusion delivers state-of-the-art performance in 3D object detection, as tested on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: The study establishes InsFusion as compatible with various methods, improving performance and addressing error accumulation issues.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a
crucial component for autonomous driving and smart transportation. However, in
the process of basic feature extraction, perspective transformation, and
feature fusion, noise and error will gradually accumulate. To address this
issue, we propose InsFusion, which can extract proposals from both raw and
fused features and utilizes these proposals to query the raw features, thereby
mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

*Xiao Li,Qi Chen,Xiulian Peng,Kai Yu,Xie Chen,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a self-supervised framework for disentangling video data into dynamic motion and static content with minimal assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to provide a robust method for separating video components to advance video analysis and generation while reducing inductive biases in disentanglement.

Method: Utilizes a transformer-based architecture for implicit feature extraction, vector quantization as a bottleneck for disentanglement, and a denoising diffusion model for representation learning.

Result: Validated on talking head videos, showing promising performance in motion transfer and auto-regressive motion generation, and generalizes well to other types, like 2D cartoon sprites.

Conclusion: Presents a novel perspective in self-supervised video representation learning, enhancing disentanglement techniques and applications in video analysis.

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

### [76] [Semantic Causality-Aware Vision-Based 3D Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08388)
*Dubing Chen,Huan Zheng,Yucheng Zhou,Xianfei Li,Wenlong Liao,Tao He,Pai Peng,Jianbing Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel causal loss to enable end-to-end supervision for vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction, overcoming the limitations of modular pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modular pipelines for 3D semantic occupancy prediction often suffer due to cascading errors and lack of end-to-end optimization.

Method: The authors introduce a causal loss that regulates gradient flow between 2D features and 3D voxel representations, making the pipeline fully differentiable. They propose components like Channel-Grouped Lifting, Learnable Camera Offsets, and Normalized Convolution.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, showing improved robustness to camera perturbations and better 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

Conclusion: Unifying the learning process of 3D semantic occupancy prediction results in better performance, robustness, and consistency by addressing modular pipeline limitations.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

*Cuong Nguyen,Dung T. Tran,Hong Nguyen,Xuan-Vu Phan,Nam-Phong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE) for enhancing degraded vehicle images in traffic surveillance, showing performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance license plate recognition accuracy by pre-processing degraded vehicle images captured in adverse traffic conditions, where existing solutions fall short.

Method: The proposed VRAE architecture integrates an auxiliary block for input-aware feature injection at encoding stages, maintaining general information and improving restoration.

Result: VRAE outperformed AE, GAN, and FB methods on metrics like PSNR, NMSE, and SSIM with only a marginal 1% parameter increment, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The VRAE method improves image quality significantly, enhancing traffic surveillance systems' accuracy and efficiency with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

### [78] [Sparse BEV Fusion with Self-View Consistency for Multi-View Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08421)
*Keisuke Toida,Taigo Sakai,Naoki Kato,Kazutoyo Yokota,Takeshi Nakamura,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCFusion is a multi-view multi-object tracking framework that improves feature integration for tasks like surveillance and autonomous driving, attaining state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking consistent object identities across multiple cameras is challenging due to viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions. Traditional BEV projection methods often introduce feature distortion which reduces accuracy.

Method: SCFusion employs sparse transformation to minimize interpolation errors, density-aware weighting for adaptive feature fusion, and a multi-view consistency loss to refine features independently before fusion.

Result: The framework achieved remarkable results, including an IDF1 score of 95.9% on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, surpassing the baseline TrackTacular.

Conclusion: SCFusion addresses limitations associated with BEV projection, enhancing multi-object tracking performance and robustness against occlusion.

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

TL;DR: LD-ViCE introduces a method to provide interpretable and temporally coherent explanations for video-based AI models using a state-of-the-art diffusion model in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based AI systems lack interpretability due to the complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models.

Method: LD-ViCE leverages latent space representations and a state-of-the-art diffusion model, coupled with refinement techniques, to generate counterfactual explanations.

Result: LD-ViCE improves explanation fidelity with a 68% increase in R2 score and halves inference time compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrated across three video datasets.

Conclusion: LD-ViCE enhances interpretability and trustworthiness in video-based AI, facilitating its deployment in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

*Xia Yue,Anfeng Liu,Ning Chen,Chenjia Huang,Hui Liu,Zhou Huang,Leyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HyperTTA, a framework for enhancing the robustness of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification under diverse degradation conditions using a spectral-spatial transformer classifier and a test-time adaptation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI classification models struggle with distribution shifts caused by real-world degradations such as noise, blur, or compression, which hinder their robustness and generalization capabilities.

Method: The authors designed HyperTTA, which includes a multi-degradation dataset, a spectral-spatial transformer classifier enhanced with multi-level receptive field and label smoothing regularization, and a test-time adaptation strategy (CELA) that updates only the affine parameters of LayerNorm layers using confidence-aware prediction entropy.

Result: HyperTTA demonstrated superior performance compared to existing baselines across various degradation scenarios, validated through experiments on two benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HyperTTA enhances HSI classification robustness by effectively combining a novel spectral-spatial transformer and confidence-aware test-time adaptation, setting a new benchmark for addressing real-world degradation challenges.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to enhance lightweight image super-resolution tasks using state space models (SSMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of SSMs in vision, particularly lightweight super-resolution tasks, and address the lack of attention on SSM modules in Mamba-based vision models.

Method: A modified calculation process for SSMs is introduced through the derivation of a first-order hold condition and its new discretized form, without increasing parameter counts.

Result: FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark datasets and surpasses current state-of-the-art lightweight super-resolution methods.

Conclusion: The FSSM enhances Mamba modules by capturing token correlations, providing an effective and parameter-efficient solution for image super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### [82] [Maximally Useful and Minimally Redundant: The Key to Self Supervised Learning for Imbalanced Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08469)
*Yash Kumar Sharma,Vineet Nair,Wilson Naik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) on imbalanced datasets, proposing a multi-view approach (more than two views) grounded on mutual information, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced datasets pose a challenge in self-supervised learning, as CSSL typically fails to generalize well to such data scenarios. Inspired by Yann LeCun's suggestion of extending multi-view approaches to more than two views, the paper addresses this gap.

Method: The authors propose leveraging the concept of mutual information to enable a more than two-view CSSL framework. By introducing a tailored loss function, they focus on extracting representative features and filtering extreme features for imbalanced datasets.

Result: The method outperforms previous approaches, achieving 2% improvement on CIFAR10-LT (ResNet-18), 5% on CIFAR100-LT (ResNet-18), and 3% on Imagenet-LT (ResNet-50).

Conclusion: The multi-view (more than two views) framework enhances CSSL performance on imbalanced datasets, opening new avenues for improving self-supervised learning in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

*Kaleem Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified pipeline for prompt-driven image analysis combining various tasks with one natural-language instruction, ensuring transparency, reliability, and user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to streamline how image analysis tasks such as detection, segmentation, editing, and description can be unified into a single pipeline using natural-language prompts, reducing the complexity of separate workflows.

Method: The authors developed a system that combines open-vocabulary detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and vision-language description. The pipeline is accessible via an interactive UI and scriptable CLI, includes debugging artifacts, and employs techniques like threshold adjustments and morphology optimization.

Result: The system achieves high accuracy in segmentation (above 85%) and usable masks (over 90%). Inpainting, being time-intensive, takes 60–75% of runtime on high-end GPUs, emphasizing the need for tuning. Operational practices are shared for reproducibility and reducing brittleness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a robust, transparent methodology for image analysis from a single prompt, providing insights for reliable implementation in tasks like object replacement, augmentation, and removal.

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in underwater object detection critical for marine applications and assess the potential of emerging technologies like LVLMs in overcoming these issues.

Method: Systematic categorization of challenges, evaluation of historical advancements, analysis of LVLMs' capabilities, and case studies using DALL-E 3 for synthetic data generation and Florence-2 LVLM fine-tuning.

Result: Key insights indicate current methods' inadequacy for dynamic underwater environments, synthetic data generation potential with LVLMs needing refinement, and the promise of LVLMs for real-time applications requiring optimization.

Conclusion: Existing UOD methods are insufficient for underwater complexity, yet LVLMs offer potential despite needing further improvement in realism, applicability, and optimization for real-time use.

including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

### [85] [Chirality in Action: Time-Aware Video Representation Learning by Latent Straightening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08502)
*Piyush Bagad,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper aims to create compact video representations that are sensitive to temporal visual changes, introducing the 'chiral action recognition' task to measure this. They propose a self-supervised adaptation method using an auto-encoder, demonstrating superior performance in video representation across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Common video embeddings struggle to represent temporal changes effectively, especially for actions that are visually opposite over time. The authors aim to address this gap by developing a method sensitive to such dynamics.

Method: The method involves a self-supervised adaptation framework with an auto-encoder that enforces a latent space inductively biased towards perceptual straightening. This improves time-sensitivity in frozen image feature sequences.

Result: The proposed compact video representation outperforms larger pre-trained video models and improves classification performance on both new and existing benchmarks across three datasets (Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, Charade).

Conclusion: The approach successfully creates compact, time-aware video embeddings that excel in distinguishing chiral action pairs and enhance performance when combined with current video models.

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

*Liyang Chen,Tianxiang Ma,Jiawei Liu,Bingchuan Li,Zhuowei Chen,Lijie Liu,Xu He,Gen Li,Qian He,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuMo introduces unified Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods for better multimodal integration, featuring a comprehensive dataset and advanced training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of scarce training data for multimodal input coordination and the difficulty of simultaneously handling subject preservation and audio-visual synchronization.

Method: HuMo constructs a paired multimodal dataset and employs a two-stage training paradigm with task-specific strategies for subject preservation and audio-visual synchronization.

Result: HuMo outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods in multimodal video generation sub-tasks, showcasing its potential as a unified framework.

Conclusion: HuMo successfully coordinates multimodal inputs, enhancing human-centric video generation through progressive learning and flexible inference strategies.

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

### [87] [MESH -- Understanding Videos Like Human: Measuring Hallucinations in Large Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08538)
*Garry Yang,Zizhe Chen,Man Hon Wong,Haoyu Lei,Yongqiang Chen,Zhenguo Li,Kaiwen Zhou,James Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MESH, a benchmark to evaluate hallucinations in Large Video Models (LVMs) using a question-answering framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Video Models (LVMs) are prone to hallucinations, producing inaccurate descriptions, and current benchmarks inadequately address this issue through human-centric evaluation processes.

Method: MESH uses a bottom-up, question-answering approach with binary and multi-choice formats to evaluate understanding of objects, subject features, and action pairs in videos.

Result: MESH effectively identifies hallucinations in LVMs, revealing that while LVMs excel in basic perception tasks, their errors increase in fine-grained or multi-action scenarios in longer videos.

Conclusion: MESH provides a systematic and comprehensive method to analyze and improve LVMs' susceptibility to hallucinations, advancing understanding of their performance patterns.

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

### [88] [ViewSparsifier: Killing Redundancy in Multi-View Plant Phenotyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08550)
*Robin-Nico Kampa,Fabian Deuser,Konrad Habel,Norbert Oswald*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of single-view deep learning methods for plant phenotyping by introducing a multi-view dataset and a novel ViewSparsifier approach, achieving success in Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve accuracy in plant phenotyping tasks (Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation) by overcoming the limitations of single-view models using multi-view datasets that capture diverse perspectives and redundant information for better feature extraction.

Method: The study incorporates multi-view embeddings where images of plants are captured from 24 selected angles. It further explores randomized view selection with increased sample diversity through selection matrices involving 120 views.

Result: The proposed ViewSparsifier approach outperformed competitors, winning both Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation tasks in the GroMo Grand Challenge.

Conclusion: Multi-view embedding strategies are effective for phenotypic analysis, suggesting expanded randomized view selection can offer further improvements. This approach is validated as a promising direction for better plant phenotyping models.

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

*Wenjun Yu,Yinchen Zhou,Jia-Xuan Jiang,Shubin Zeng,Yuee Li,Zhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes improved methods for multimodal medical image segmentation using semantic aggregation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models underperform in medical image segmentation due to challenges like a semantic gap between textual prompts and visual features and feature dispersion.

Method: The authors introduce an Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism to cluster features and a Text-Guided Pixel Decoder to bridge semantic gaps with domain-invariant knowledge.

Result: Experiments on cardiac and fundus datasets show consistent state-of-the-art performance across domain generalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively close the performance gap in medical image segmentation, improving model generalization in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

### [90] [Improving Greenland Bed Topography Mapping with Uncertainty-Aware Graph Learning on Sparse Radar Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08571)
*Bayu Adhi Tama,Homayra Alam,Mostafa Cham,Omar Faruque,Jianwu Wang,Vandana Janeja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphTopoNet is a graph-learning framework designed to map Greenland's subglacial bed accurately, improving on existing models by handling sparse and uneven radar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by sparse and uneven radar observations in mapping Greenland's subglacial bed, which is critical for predicting sea-level rise.

Method: GraphTopoNet utilizes graph-based learning with Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty modeling. It incorporates surface observables, gradient features, and polynomial trends, and combines confidence-weighted radar supervision with balanced regularization to handle data gaps.

Result: When applied to Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet reduced mapping errors by up to 60% compared to other methods while preserving detailed glacial features.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the accuracy of Greenland's subglacial bed maps, supporting climate agencies with better modeling tools, and demonstrates the potential of graph machine learning for processing sparse geophysical datasets.

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

### [91] [Calibrating MLLM-as-a-judge via Multimodal Bayesian Prompt Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08777)
*Eric Slyman,Mehrab Tanjim,Kushal Kafle,Stefan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multimodal Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB), a novel method to improve the performance and calibration of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) used in text-to-image (TTI) generation evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional "judge" models evaluating TTI systems face issues like biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across image domains. Existing prompt ensembling methods from unimodal applications fail to address these challenges effectively in the multimodal context.

Method: The proposed MMB method utilizes a Bayesian prompt ensemble technique combined with image clustering. This allows dynamic assignment of prompt weights based on the visual features of each sample.

Result: MMB demonstrated improved accuracy and enhanced calibration in pairwise preference judgment tasks. It outperformed baseline models in terms of alignment with human annotations and consistency across diverse image content on HPSv2 and MJBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMB offers a robust multimodal-specific approach for calibrating TTI evaluation models, paving the way for more reliable large-scale assessments with reduced biases and greater interpretability.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to reduce the manual workload for 3D segmentation in medical imaging by using an implicit shape prior and an interaction-minimizing framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity and workload in manual medical image segmentation tasks that are essential but cannot be completely automated yet.

Method: Introducing an implicit shape prior for segmentation and a framework for automatically selecting informative slices to minimize manual interactions.

Result: Validated on two use cases: segmentation of organs at risk in brain cancer radiotherapy and creation of a muscle shape database for sarcopenia patients.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces manual segmentation burden and accelerates medical database creation in selected applications.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

*Jinhan Li,Haoyang He,Lei Xie,Jiangning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a high-resolution dataset for detecting diffusion-based image manipulations and introduces an efficient model, EfficientIML, which achieves superior performance in localization and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging diffusion-based forgery methods remain underrepresented in traditional training datasets, limiting the effectiveness of current manipulation detectors.

Method: The authors present a novel high-resolution SIF dataset and propose the EfficientIML model, which employs a lightweight EfficientRWKV backbone combining state-space and attention mechanisms with multi-scale supervision for efficient and accurate detection.

Result: The proposed method outperforms SOTA models in terms of localization accuracy, computational efficiency (FLOPs), and inference speed on both the novel dataset and standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: EfficientIML demonstrates its capability for real-time forensic applications, thanks to its lightweight design and superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

*Zhihao Zhao,Yinzheng Zhao,Junjie Yang,Xiangtong Yao,Quanmin Liang,Shahrooz Faghihroohi,Kai Huang,Nassir Navab,M. Ali Nasseri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLAPS (CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation), a method for unified and automated segmentation in retinal imaging, addressing challenges faced by existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image segmentation methods, particularly in retinal imaging, struggle with modality ambiguity in textual descriptions, manual prompting in SAM workflows, and a lack of unified frameworks.

Method: CLAPS uses a CLIP-based image encoder pre-trained on a large multi-modal retinal dataset, GroundingDINO for automatic bounding box prompts, and text prompts enhanced with a 'modality signature' for guidance. This system integrates these inputs with SAM for precise segmentation.

Result: Experiments on 12 retinal datasets across 11 segmentation tasks showed CLAPS performing comparably to specialized models while surpassing current benchmarks in most metrics.

Conclusion: CLAPS demonstrates high generalizability and efficiency, offering a unified solution to retinal imaging segmentation challenges.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using advertisement videos to evaluate large language models (LLMs) beyond their general capabilities, introducing a new benchmark called AdsQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore specialized applications for knowledgeable LLMs using clue-rich ad videos, which demand understanding persuasive strategies and marketing logic.

Method: Developed AdsQA, a benchmark derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips. Also introduced ReAd-R, a reinforcement learning model optimized for answering questions about ad content.

Result: Benchmarked 14 leading LLMs on AdsQA, with ReAd-R achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing models designed for deep reasoning.

Conclusion: Advertisement videos challenge LLMs in a novel way and highlight their ability to process nuanced tasks. ReAd-R showcases the potential of further optimizing LLMs for specialized test-beds.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain
reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

*Zhihao Zhao,Yinzheng Zhao,Junjie Yang,Xiangtong Yao,Quanmin Liang,Daniel Zapp,Kai Huang,Nassir Navab,M. Ali Nasseri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven framework named \UOPSL for enhancing ophthalmic disease recognition using unpaired multimodal data, specifically integrating OCT spatial priors into fundus image-based diagnoses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ophthalmic disease diagnosis has benefited significantly from multimodal techniques, but the scarcity and cost of paired OCT data restrict further advancements. The goal is to overcome this limitation and improve disease recognition using unpaired fundus and OCT images.

Method: The proposed \UOPSL framework employs contrastive learning for unpaired OCT and fundus images, developing a predilection sites matrix to capture lesion localization in the OCT feature space. During fundus image classification, OCT data is excluded, and the matrix is utilized for enhanced recognition.

Result: Experiments across 9 datasets and 28 disease categories demonstrate superior performance of \UOPSL compared to existing benchmarks, effectively managing modality imbalance.

Conclusion: The study successfully bridges unpaired fundus and OCT image modalities via a novel framework, offering a significant improvement in ophthalmic disease classification and advancing approaches for scenarios with imbalanced data availability.

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

*Xuqin Wang,Tao Wu,Yanfeng Zhang,Lu Liu,Dong Wang,Mingwei Sun,Yongliang Wang,Niclas Zeller,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LADB proposes a semi-supervised framework for data-scarce domain translation using pretrained models coupled with partially paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges with diffusion models in data-scarce domains, especially when full supervision or paired data is unavailable.

Method: A semi-supervised approach aligning latent spaces of source and target domains, integrating pretrained models and custom latent-target alignments.

Result: Superior performance in partial supervision for tasks like depth-to-image translation, multi-source, and multi-target domain translation.

Conclusion: LADB offers scalable and effective solutions for domain translation tasks where fully paired data or exhaustive supervision is infeasible.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

*Liangjin Liu,Haoyang Zheng,Pei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DSLNet, a dual-stream architecture specifically designed for isolated sign language recognition, effectively addressing challenges related to gestures with similar morphology yet distinct semantics, and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in ISLR posed by morphologically similar but semantically distinct gestures that existing methods fail to differentiate due to reliance on single reference frames.

Method: Proposes DSLNet, a dual-reference, dual-stream architecture using wrist-centric and facial-centric frames for shape and trajectory analysis, processed with specialized networks integrated using optimal transport fusion.

Result: DSLNet achieves 93.70%, 89.97%, and 99.79% accuracy on WLASL-100, WLASL-300, and LSA64 datasets, outperforming existing models with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The approach effectively decouples gesture morphology and trajectory modeling, enhancing accuracy while maintaining efficiency, establishing a new benchmark for ISLR systems.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape

*Sara Behnamian,Rasoul Khaksarinezhad,Andreas Langer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FractalPINN-Flow is a deep learning framework for optical flow estimation, learning directly from grayscale frames without ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework for dense optical flow estimation that does not rely on labeled ground truth data.

Method: Introduced a Fractal Deformation Network (FDN) with recursive encoder-decoder architecture and trained using an energy functional combining brightness constancy and total variation regularization.

Result: Experiments demonstrated accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow estimation, particularly on high-resolution data and limited annotation scenarios.

Conclusion: FractalPINN-Flow effectively addresses dense optical flow estimation challenges while being unsupervised, making it useful for scenarios with sparse annotations.

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Abstract: Coastal water segmentation from satellite imagery presents unique challenges
due to complex spectral characteristics and irregular boundary patterns.
Traditional RGB-based approaches often suffer from training instability and
poor generalization in diverse maritime environments. This paper introduces a
systematic robust enhancement framework, referred to as Robust U-Net, that
leverages HSV color space supervision and multi-modal constraints for improved
coastal water segmentation. Our approach integrates five synergistic
components: HSV-guided color supervision, gradient-based coastline
optimization, morphological post-processing, sea area cleanup, and connectivity
control. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that HSV
supervision provides the highest impact (0.85 influence score), while the
complete framework achieves superior training stability (84\% variance
reduction) and enhanced segmentation quality. Our method shows consistent

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)
techniques and their transformative impact on computer vision (CV)
applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity
visual data in challenging conditions, such as low light, motion blur, or high
dynamic range scenes, thereby limiting the performance of state-of-the-art CV

dynamic range (HDR) imaging, deblurring, high-speed imaging, and glare
mitigation, address these limitations by enhancing image acquisition and
reconstruction processes. This survey systematically explores the synergies
between CI techniques and core CV tasks, including object detection, depth

analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of deploying resource-intensive large-scale multimodal language models in real-world, resource-constrained environments while balancing computational efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and environmental sustainability.

Method: The authors propose a new framework called BcQLM, centered on BreezeCLIP, which is a compact vision-language encoder optimized for lightweight and efficient multimodal tasks with only 1.2 billion parameters.

Result: The model significantly reduces computational requirements, delivering performance comparable to standard large-scale multimodal models. Experiments across multiple datasets validate its balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: BcQLM demonstrates the feasibility of deploying high-performance, lightweight multimodal models under practical hardware constraints, making it suitable for broader real-world applications.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

*Marius Dähling,Sebastian Krebs,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CrowdQuery (CQ), a novel method for enhancing crowd detection in both 2D and 3D using density information, yielding state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of detecting objects in crowded scenes, which is difficult for traditional detection methods due to high object density and overlapping. A bridging solution for both 2D and 3D detection is also lacking.

Method: The new method introduces the CQ module that predicts and embeds object density maps into object queries for transformer-based detection architectures. This approach enhances detection accuracy in crowded environments and is adaptable to both 2D and 3D domains.

Result: CQ enhances the performance of base transformer models in crowded scenes, achieving significant improvements on the STCrowd and CrowdHuman datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CrowdQuery is a versatile and effective approach for improving object detection in crowded scenes, bridging 2D and 3D detection tasks and showing generalizability across datasets.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

*Lena Wild,Rafael Valencia,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArgoTweak introduces a dataset with realistic map priors for HD maps to address the sim2real gap, enabling self-updating and self-verifying mapping solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HD map development lacks the complete set of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data, forcing reliance on synthetic priors which produce inconsistencies and limit real-world applicability.

Method: ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework to detect and integrate changes at the atomic map element level. This ensures accurate updates while preserving unchanged elements.

Result: Training models on ArgoTweak significantly minimizes the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors, and structured priors with detailed annotations improve mapping outcomes.

Conclusion: ArgoTweak establishes a benchmark for scalable, explainable HD mapping solutions, advancing prior-aided self-improving mapping technologies.

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes a deep-learning framework for diagnosing arsenicosis through mobile phone skin images, achieving high accuracy with Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arsenicosis caused by arsenic-contaminated water is underdiagnosed in rural areas due to a lack of accessible dermatological expertise. There is a need for automated, image-based tools for early diagnosis and timely intervention.

Method: The researchers curated a dataset of 11000+ images across 20 dermatological classes, benchmarked CNN and Transformer-based models, and integrated interpretability tools like LIME and Grad-CAM. They also deployed a web-based diagnostic prototype.

Result: Transformer-based models outperformed CNNs, with Swin Transformer achieving 86% accuracy. The system generalized well to external validation samples, showing promise for real-world use.

Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of an explainable, mobile-friendly deep learning framework to aid in early arsenicosis diagnosis, especially in underserved rural areas, reducing dependency on specialist availability.

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

### [106] [Quantifying Accuracy of an Event-Based Star Tracker via Earth's Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08794)
*Dennis Melamed,Connor Hashemi,Scott McCloskey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates event-based cameras (EBCs) for star tracking, leveraging Earth's motion as ground truth and achieving promising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurate ground truth determination when using event-based cameras for star tracking.

Method: An EBC was kept static and used with a telescope to track stars, leveraging Earth's rotational motion as the only reference for calibration. Comparison was made with the International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS).

Result: The EBC achieved a root mean squared error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds for star tracking performance.

Conclusion: Event-based cameras demonstrate sufficient accuracy for low-cost, low-latency star tracking, with additional benefits like reduced computation, high dynamic range, and faster updates.

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

*Matthieu Vilain,Rémi Giraud,Yannick Berthoumieu,Guillaume Bourmaud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEAMER is introduced as a novel image matching architecture that maintains multiple hypothesis predictions at each scale, addressing challenges like depth discontinuities and strong zooms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art methods struggle to accurately match images in challenging scenarios due to reliance on single correspondent prediction at each scale.

Method: BEAMER uses beam search for propagating multiple hypotheses and integrates them into cross-attention layers for dense matching.

Result: The architecture improves robustness and accuracy in image matching, especially under challenging conditions like depth discontinuities and zoomed-in target images.

Conclusion: BEAMER effectively enhances dense image matching performance by leveraging the propagation of multiple hypotheses.

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GeneVA, a dataset for analyzing artifacts in text-driven video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address limitations in probabilistic generative models for video, such as unpredictable artifacts and temporal inconsistencies.

Method: Developed a large-scale dataset called GeneVA focused on spatio-temporal video artifacts generated from text prompts.

Result: Provides a benchmark for evaluating and improving text-driven generative video models.

Conclusion: GeneVA is expected to facilitate critical advancements in video model benchmarking and quality enhancements.

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RewardDance introduces a scalable reward modeling framework to overcome limitations of existing models in visual generation using RLHF. It aligns reward objectives with VLM architectures to enable better scaling and effective outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models for visual generation face challenges like architectural constraints, misalignment with next-token prediction, and reward hacking, limiting scaling and quality improvement.

Method: Introduced RewardDance, which reformulates reward scoring using VLM architecture to predict success probabilities via a 'yes' token. It scales models and contexts, integrating task instructions and reasoning.

Result: RewardDance significantly outperformed state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video generation, resolving reward hacking and improving output quality and diversity.

Conclusion: The RewardDance framework not only addresses key challenges like reward hacking and mode collapse but also enables scalable and high-performance visual generation models, showcasing its effectiveness.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the challenging task of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes, specifically fabrics, using monocular video data while addressing depth ambiguity.

Method: The method integrates physical simulation of cloth geometry and differentiable rendering, introducing two novel regularization terms to enhance depth accuracy.

Result: The approach reduced reconstruction error by a factor of 2.64 compared to previous methods and achieved sharp appearance estimations from RGB video data.

Conclusion: The proposed system significantly advances the field by offering realistic and detailed 3D reconstruction and rendering using only a single monocular RGB video, proving effective against existing challenges.

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

TL;DR: Hetis is a new LLM serving system designed to optimize performance on heterogeneous GPU clusters by employing fine-grained and dynamic parallelism strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to fully utilize heterogeneous hardware in LLM serving production clusters to address inefficiencies of existing coarse-grained static parallelization strategies.

Method: Hetis introduces dynamic parallelization, distributing attention computations selectively to low-end GPUs, combined with an online load dispatching mechanism optimizing memory and computational balance.

Result: Through evaluation, Hetis demonstrates a 2.25× improvement in throughput and a 1.49× reduction in latency compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Hetis significantly boosts efficiency and performance for LLM serving in heterogeneous GPU clusters through its innovative design.

Abstract: The significant resource demands in LLM serving prompts production clusters
to fully utilize heterogeneous hardware by partitioning LLM models across a mix
of high-end and low-end GPUs. However, existing parallelization approaches
often struggle to scale efficiently in heterogeneous environments due to their
coarse-grained and static parallelization strategies.
  In this paper, we introduce Hetis, a new LLM system tailored for
heterogeneous GPU clusters. Hetis addresses two critical challenges: (1) memory
inefficiency caused by the mismatch between memory capacity and computational
power in heterogeneous devices, and (2) computational inefficiency arising from
performance gaps across different LLM modules. To tackle these issues, Hetis
employs a fine-grained and dynamic parallelism design. Specifically, it
selectively parallelizes compute-intensive operations to reduce latency and
dynamically distributes Attention computations to low-end GPUs at a head
granularity, leveraging the distinct characteristics of each module.
Additionally, Hetis features an online load dispatching policy that
continuously optimizes serving performance by carefully balancing network
latency, computational load, and memory intensity. Evaluation results
demonstrate that Hetis can improve serving throughput by up to $2.25\times$ and
reduce latency by $1.49\times$ compared to existing systems.

TL;DR: Duplex provides a unified framework for optimized network topology and graph sampling in Decentralized Federated Graph Learning, improving efficiency and training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address high communication costs and training degradation in decentralized federated graph learning caused by cross-worker communication and statistical heterogeneity.

Method: Duplex offers a learning-driven algorithm that jointly optimizes network topology and graph sampling, adapting to dynamic network environments and worker-specific needs.

Result: Experiments show reductions in completion time (20.1%-48.8%) and communication costs (16.7%-37.6%) while improving accuracy (3.3%-7.9%) under identical resource budgets.

Conclusion: The Duplex framework mitigates communication overhead and training inefficiencies, enhancing the practicality of decentralized federated graph learning.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Graph Learning (DFGL) overcomes potential bottlenecks
of the parameter server in FGL by establishing a peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication network among workers. However, while extensive cross-worker
communication of graph node embeddings is crucial for DFGL training, it
introduces substantial communication costs. Most existing works typically
construct sparse network topologies or utilize graph neighbor sampling methods
to alleviate the communication overhead in DFGL. Intuitively, integrating these
methods may offer promise for doubly improving communication efficiency in
DFGL. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that directly combining
these methods leads to significant training performance degradation if they are
jointly optimized. To address this issue, we propose Duplex, a unified
framework that jointly optimizes network topology and graph sampling by
accounting for their coupled relationship, thereby significantly reducing
communication cost while enhancing training performance in DFGL. To overcome
practical DFGL challenges, eg, statistical heterogeneity and dynamic network
environments, Duplex introduces a learning-driven algorithm to adaptively
determine optimal network topologies and graph sampling ratios for workers.
Experimental results demonstrate that Duplex reduces completion time by
20.1%--48.8% and communication costs by 16.7%--37.6% to achieve target
accuracy, while improving accuracy by 3.3%--7.9% under identical resource
budgets compared to baselines.

*Federico Fontana,Anxhelo Diko,Romeo Lanzino,Marco Raoul Marini,Bachir Kaddar,Gian Luca Foresti,Luigi Cinque*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of continual learning in deepfake detection by proposing an efficient framework to adapt to new manipulation techniques while retaining past knowledge. It evaluates the method using real-world simulations and introduces new metrics for historical and future performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity and evolution of deepfake technologies make it challenging for detection systems to keep up with emerging techniques using traditional retraining methods.

Method: The paper reframes deepfake detection as a continual learning problem by implementing a lightweight framework for real-time adaptation to new deepfake techniques, incorporating simulations over a 7-year span of deepfake technology evolution, and introducing two novel metrics (C-AUC and FWT-AUC).

Result: Experiments showed the framework is 155 times faster than full retraining, efficient at retaining historical knowledge, but struggles to generalize to future generators, achieving near-random performance.

Conclusion: Deepfake detection systems must address the challenge of non-universal distributions, as current methods fail to future-proof against unseen generators.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.
  \textbf{Code will be released upon acceptance.}

### [119] [How Far Are We from True Unlearnability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08058)
*Kai Ye,Liangcai Su,Chenxiong Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the limitations of unlearnable examples (UEs) in model training across multiple tasks, finding they often fail in domains like semantic segmentation and proposing metrics like Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) and Unlearnable Distance (UD) to quantify unlearnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper lies in protecting the interests of data owners by exploring methods to create truly unlearnable data that prevent their unauthorized use in model training.

Method: The authors examine model optimization processes, study differences in loss landscapes, and introduce SAL and UD metrics to evaluate the unlearnability of data.

Result: The study revealed gaps in achieving cross-task unlearnability and highlighted the relationship between loss convergence and unlearnability. New metrics (SAL and UD) were successfully applied for quantitative benchmarks of unlearnable methods.

Conclusion: Unlearnable examples continue to fall short of being universally effective across tasks. Better metrics like SAL and UD might guide improvements in creating robust unlearnable methods and safeguard data ownership.

Abstract: High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but
the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests
of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been
proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the
training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and
the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these
data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,
they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we
find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks
such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.
This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly
unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective
of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the
convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model
architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of
the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,
implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.
Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons
for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the
unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose
an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the
SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we
conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed
UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of
existing unlearnable methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entity linking is crucial for connecting textual mentions with knowledge graph entities, especially in applications like News Analytics to save costs and improve insights.

Method: The paper develops JEL, a multi-neural network-based model for computationally efficient entity linking.

Result: JEL performs better than the current state-of-the-art EL models, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: JEL is a significant advancement in entity linking, offering efficiency and performance improvements for practical applications, like News Analytics, in organizations.

Abstract: We present JEL, a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural
network based entity linking model, which beats current state-of-art model.
Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing
critical relationships among the entities of interest and integrating data from
multiple heterogeneous sources. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph
is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are
encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there
are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking
mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental
task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,
such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an
essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a
survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the
firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \$2
million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is
critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling
users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and
dramatically facilitating their daily work.

TL;DR: The paper discusses evaluation methods for generative AI applications in healthcare, emphasizing the limitations of current quantitative benchmarks and exploring alternative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing benchmarks for assessing generative AI in healthcare, which may not generalize well to real-world clinical tasks.

Method: The paper reviews state-of-the-art methodologies and explores strategies involving human expertise and cost-effective computational evaluators.

Result: It highlights the need for diverse evaluation approaches that consider clinical applicability and real-world variability.

Conclusion: Current evaluation methods for generative AI in healthcare must evolve to incorporate broader and more realistic measures of performance.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represent an emerging paradigm
within artificial intelligence, with applications throughout the medical
enterprise. Assessing GenAI applications necessitates a comprehensive
understanding of the clinical task and awareness of the variability in
performance when implemented in actual clinical environments. Presently, a
prevalent method for evaluating the performance of generative models relies on
quantitative benchmarks. Such benchmarks have limitations and may suffer from
train-to-the-test overfitting, optimizing performance for a specified test set
at the cost of generalizability across other task and data distributions.
Evaluation strategies leveraging human expertise and utilizing cost-effective
computational models as evaluators are gaining interest. We discuss current
state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing the performance of GenAI
applications in healthcare and medical devices.

*Hritik Arasu,Faisal R Jahangiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of modern generative models to synthesize realistic EEG artifact segments for analysis, comparing WGAN-GP and 1D diffusion models for their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG artifacts hinder automated analysis and labeling them is resource-intensive, requiring finding scalable solutions to synthesize artifact data.

Method: The study utilizes a TUH EEG Artifact corpus with preprocessing tailored to different models (WGAN-GP and diffusion models) to evaluate their fidelity, specificity, and utility.

Result: WGAN-GP performed better in spectral alignment and MMD scores, but both models showed limitations in class-conditional recovery and augmentation gains.

Conclusion: Generative models offer potential for EEG artifact synthesis, but need improved conditioning and broader coverage for real-world utility. The work sets a baseline and outlines areas for improvement.

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode,
chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at
scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic,
label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing.
Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and
fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing
tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training;
per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional
WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with
classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch
band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$),
channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and
distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional
recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation
effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer
spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak
class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing
opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible
pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts --
to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable
failure modes for future work.

*Ho Ming Lee,Katrien Antonio,Benjamin Avanzi,Lorenzo Marchi,Rui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distance covariance regularization framework to address fairness across multiple protected attributes, including intersectional subgroups, in machine learning regression and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure fairness across protected attributes, including intersectional subgroups, in machine learning applications to comply with anti-discrimination laws.

Method: The framework minimizes associations between predictions and protected attributes using demographic parity definitions and extends to multivariate dependence measures, namely joint distance covariance (JdCov) and concatenated distance covariance (CCdCov).

Result: The proposed framework effectively mitigates fairness gerrymandering for intersectional subgroups and applies to various datasets including COMPAS and motor insurance claims.

Conclusion: The paper provides a robust method for achieving fairness in both regression and classification machine learning tasks across diverse and intersectional subgroups.

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as
gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing
literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in
regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is
equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous
attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In
practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,
methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called
"fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional
subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we
propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the
association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with
the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear
and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of
multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two
multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously
proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance
covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both
regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various
types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,
including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies
dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our
framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims
dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on federated learning vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks and introduces a new adaptive adversary alongside a combined defense called Krum+ to counter them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces security challenges, especially from backdoor attacks facilitated by malicious clients. Existing defenses fail against adaptive attackers.

Method: The authors introduce a new adaptive adversary with enhanced attack capabilities to exploit vulnerabilities in federated learning. Additionally, they propose a combined defense approach named Hammer and Anvil, leveraging orthogonal defenses.

Result: The new adaptive adversary demonstrates the ability to compromise models with very few malicious clients. The Krum+ defense successfully mitigates these attacks as well as existing ones.

Conclusion: The study establishes that combining orthogonal defenses like Hammer and Anvil into Krum+ provides robust protection against advanced adaptive adversaries and other backdoor attacks in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning technique in which multiple
clients cooperate to train a machine learning model. Distributed settings
facilitate backdoor attacks by malicious clients, who can embed malicious
behaviors into the model during their participation in the training process.
These malicious behaviors are activated during inference by a specific trigger.
No defense against backdoor attacks has stood the test of time, especially
against adaptive attackers, a powerful but not fully explored category of
attackers. In this work, we first devise a new adaptive adversary that
surpasses existing adversaries in capabilities, yielding attacks that only
require one or two malicious clients out of 20 to break existing
state-of-the-art defenses. Then, we present Hammer and Anvil, a principled
defense approach that combines two defenses orthogonal in their underlying
principle to produce a combined defense that, given the right set of
parameters, must succeed against any attack. We show that our best combined
defense, Krum+, is successful against our new adaptive adversary and
state-of-the-art attacks.

*Caio de Prospero Iglesias,Kimberly Villalobos Carballo,Dimitris Bertsimas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Prescribe-then-Select (PS) for choosing the best policy in contextual stochastic optimization, outperforming single-policy approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In contextual stochastic optimization, existing policies exhibit varying performance across covariates, and no single policy universally performs best.

Method: PS first constructs a library of candidate policies and then uses data-driven meta-policies based on ensembles of Optimal Policy Trees to select the optimal policy for given covariates.

Result: PS outperformed single-policy methods in heterogeneous covariate spaces and converged to the dominant policy when heterogeneity was absent in benchmark problems.

Conclusion: The modular PS framework offers an effective, data-driven solution for policy selection in contextual stochastic optimization under varied covariate conditions.

Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic
optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information
and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings,
multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice
entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage
newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the
best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and
converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the

TL;DR: PhysioCLR is a self-supervised, physiology-aware contrastive learning framework for ECG analysis, aimed at improving arrhythmia classification using less labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited availability of labeled ECG data hampers the effectiveness of AI in diagnostic tasks. Leveraging large-scale unlabeled data through SSL and integrating domain-specific knowledge can enhance clinical outcomes.

Method: PhysioCLR uses contrastive learning to closely align similar ECG features while separating dissimilar ones. It incorporates ECG-specific augmentations, physiological similarity cues, and a hybrid loss function to refine learned data representations.

Result: PhysioCLR improves the mean AUROC by 12% compared to the strongest baseline on multiple public and private ECG datasets, proving its robustness in generalization.

Conclusion: PhysioCLR, by embedding physiological insights into SSL frameworks, shows promise for advancing more efficient and clinically meaningful ECG diagnostics.

Abstract: Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart
conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based
ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning
Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that
incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and
clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During
pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that
share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are
dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological
similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically
meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific
augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a
hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.
Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,
for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for
binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,
PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,
underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding
physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model
to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:
PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a
promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive
temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability
techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction
and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and
validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),
employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed
two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.
Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner
2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various
standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.
ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC
subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and
frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and
activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding
in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of
DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

### [128] [Modified Loss of Momentum Gradient Descent: Fine-Grained Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08483)
*Matias D. Cattaneo,Boris Shigida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB), demonstrating memory decay and modified dynamics on invariant manifolds, supported by rigorous approximation bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics and mathematical structure of the HB method, particularly its impact on memory decay and optimization efficiency.

Method: The authors explore invariant manifold dynamics, derive modified loss approximations, analyze HB combinatorics, and provide rigorous mathematical bounds for approximation accuracy.

Result: HB dynamics are shown to effectively act as modified gradient descent, with rich polynomial structures described and rigorous bounds provided for approximation.

Conclusion: The insights deepen understanding of HB and provide avenues for analyzing other optimization algorithms, highlighting its theoretical underpinnings and practical implications.

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed
momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory.
Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially
attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent
with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although
the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with
arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation
bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless
approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in
$\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We
derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with
rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics,
generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch
and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features
of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for
similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.

*Konstantin Burlachenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Federated Learning (FL), introducing novel approaches to improve its practical and theoretical aspects while emphasizing real-world implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning presents challenges related to decentralized environments, heterogeneous data, communication issues, and privacy, making it necessary to bridge theoretical advancements with practical implementations.

Method: The paper identifies core challenges in FL and proposes innovative methods to address these through improved algorithms and systems, emphasizing the interplay between theory and real-world application.

Result: The contributions enhance the effectiveness of Federated Learning by improving both theoretical understanding and practical implementation, offering actionable strategies for researchers.

Conclusion: The study serves as guidance for addressing complexities in FL, promoting both theory-to-practice translation and the reverse adaptation of practical insights into theoretical algorithm design.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.

*Kishan Padayachy,Ronald Richman,Salvatore Scognamiglio,Mario V. Wüthrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an advanced neural network architecture, leveraging the Credibility Transformer combined with an in-context learning mechanism to improve predictive accuracy and generalization, notably for unseen categorical feature levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of traditional Transformers in predictive modeling by introducing credibility mechanisms and in-context learning to enhance feature representations and improve generalization.

Method: They extend the Credibility Transformer with an in-context learning paradigm, where information is enriched via a 'context batch' containing similar instances. This mechanism augments CLS token representations through fine-tuning with additional context information.

Result: Empirical tests demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and model adaptability to new instances, notably managing unseen categorical feature levels during training.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture shows promise in enhancing the flexibility, accuracy, and generalization of models in predictive tasks, particularly in dynamic scenarios such as the introduction of new categorical features.

Abstract: The starting point of our network architecture is the Credibility Transformer
which extends the classical Transformer architecture by a credibility mechanism
to improve model learning and predictive performance. This Credibility
Transformer learns credibilitized CLS tokens that serve as learned
representations of the original input features. In this paper we present a new
paradigm that augments this architecture by an in-context learning mechanism,
i.e., we increase the information set by a context batch consisting of similar
instances. This allows the model to enhance the CLS token representations of
the instances by additional in-context information and fine-tuning. We
empirically verify that this in-context learning enhances predictive accuracy
by adapting to similar risk patterns. Moreover, this in-context learning also
allows the model to generalize to new instances which, e.g., have feature
levels in the categorical covariates that have not been present when the model
was trained -- for a relevant example, think of a new vehicle model which has
just been developed by a car manufacturer.

### [131] [Sketched Gaussian Mechanism for Private Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08195)
*Qiaobo Li,Zhijie Chen,Arindam Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM) for federated learning, combining sketching and the Gaussian mechanism to offer improved privacy guarantees without increasing noise budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges in communication cost and client-level privacy. Current approaches address these factors individually but lack joint frameworks leveraging their interplay.

Method: SGM integrates sketching and the Gaussian mechanism, while a joint Rènyi Differential Privacy (DP) analysis assesses its privacy performance. The method applies to federated learning with gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, ensuring theoretical optimization convergence.

Result: SGM achieves stronger privacy guarantees compared to traditional Gaussian mechanisms under a similar noise budget. It demonstrates competitive or superior performance in federated learning settings, confirmed by theoretical and experimental assessments.

Conclusion: SGM offers a more flexible and effective privacy-preserving method for federated learning, improving performance at the same noise and privacy budget, especially when coupled with adaptive server optimization.

Abstract: Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated
learning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the
clients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round
communication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of
clipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee
client-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes
privacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching
provides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to
supply any additional desired privacy.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which
directly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using
R\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy
guarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to
isolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the
privacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for
moderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the
original GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM
to FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish
theoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a
logarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results
confirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive
with non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.
Moreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical
performance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework combining LLMs with an ML-based ensemble model for rare, high-impact outcome prediction, applied to Venture Capital decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of predicting rare, high-impact events with improved precision and interpretability, particularly in decision-making with incomplete and noisy data, such as in Venture Capital.

Method: The framework integrates LLM-powered feature engineering for unstructured data analysis followed by a layered ensemble comprising methods like XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. It outputs a continuous success likelihood, thresholded into binary predictions.

Result: The model significantly outperforms a random baseline, achieving precision between 9.8X and 11.1X in various test subsets, with interpretability insights like startup category and founder count as key predictors.

Conclusion: The approach combines predictive strength with interpretability, effectively addressing the complexities of startup evaluation in Venture Capital and offering a replicable model for other domains.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for predicting rare, high-impact outcomes by
integrating large language models (LLMs) with a multi-model machine learning
(ML) architecture. The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box
models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use
LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from
unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models
including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first
produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded
to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the
domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with
limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong
performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random
classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity
analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category
list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of
founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet
consistent effects.

TL;DR: The paper examines model-heterogeneous federated learning (FL) and builds a benchmarking platform "PracMHBench" to evaluate such algorithms under practical edge device constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-heterogeneous FL supports customized models on edge devices, making it more practical than traditional FL. However, there is a lack of quantitative analysis of these algorithms concerning edge constraints.

Method: The authors developed a system platform, PracMHBench, to classify and test different model-heterogeneous FL algorithms across various data tasks, metrics, and edge device constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments were performed using PracMHBench, yielding insights into the applicability of model-heterogeneous algorithms under different edge constraints and heterogeneity patterns.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for rethinking and improving model-heterogeneous FL paradigms under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource
constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional
federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to
cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the
model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately,
no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms
under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis
on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and
re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform
\textbf{PracMHBench} to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical
constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are
classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the
platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the
different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding
heterogeneity pattern.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a data-driven, model-free alternative for generating SDE sample paths and explore its potential for financial decision-making, overcoming limitations of traditional Monte Carlo methods.

Method: Employing conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic paths from given finite sample paths of an SDE, and comparing it against benchmarks like neural SDEs through simulations and empirical studies.

Result: The method outperforms benchmarks in simulations and aids reinforcement learning for portfolio selection, demonstrating its practical utility in finance.

Conclusion: Diffusion models represent a viable tool for generating synthetic paths of SDEs and finding applications in finance, potentially advancing data-driven reinforcement learning and decision-making in the field.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.

TL;DR: This paper introduces mmm-fair, an open-source toolkit for balancing model performance and fairness through dynamic optimization that supports diverse fairness objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing regulatory and societal demands for equitable AI, alongside intersectional biases and conflicting fairness definitions, create challenges in deploying fair machine learning models.

Method: The paper proposes mmm-fair, leveraging boosting-based ensemble approaches for dynamic optimization of model weights, aiming to minimize classification errors and fairness violations.

Result: mmm-fair uniquely supports multi-objective optimization and fairness exploration with features such as interactive Pareto exploration, custom constraints, LLM-powered explanations, and deployment-ready models.

Conclusion: As an innovative toolkit, mmm-fair addresses limitations of existing fairness tools and facilitates equitable AI development by enabling context-sensitive fairness evaluation and optimization.

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification requires balancing performance and fairness,
often intensified by intersectional biases. Conflicting fairness definitions
further complicate the task, making it difficult to identify universally fair
solutions. Despite growing regulatory and societal demands for equitable AI,
popular toolkits offer limited support for exploring multi-dimensional fairness
and related trade-offs. To address this, we present mmm-fair, an open-source
toolkit leveraging boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically
optimizes model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse
fairness violations, enabling flexible multi-objective optimization. The system
empowers users to deploy models that align with their context-specific needs
while reliably uncovering intersectional biases often missed by
state-of-the-art methods. In a nutshell, mmm-fair uniquely combines in-depth
multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, a no-code, chat-based
interface, LLM-powered explanations, interactive Pareto exploration for model
selection, custom fairness constraint definition, and deployment-ready models
in a single open-source toolkit, a combination rarely found in existing
fairness tools. Demo walkthrough available at: https://youtu.be/_rcpjlXFqkw.

*Honghui Du,Leandro Minku,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARLINE is a novel method addressing concept drift by leveraging knowledge from multiple data sources using ensemble-based predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept drift in online learning deteriorates predictive performance and existing methods assume source models represent similar concepts to the target, which is often unrealistic.

Method: MARLINE maps the target concept to the space of each source concept, enabling source sub-models to predict the target concept in an ensemble approach.

Result: The method outperformed state-of-the-art data stream learning approaches in accuracy across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MARLINE effectively handles non-stationary environments by tapping into multiple sources, even without matching source and target concepts, enhancing predictive reliability.

Abstract: Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the
predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have
started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle
concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption
that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the
target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng
for Non-stationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge
from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and
target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept
to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers
to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an
ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning
approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two methods, BR-MARLENE and BRPW-MARLENE, for multi-label transfer learning in non-stationary data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label drift and inter-label dependencies in multi-label data streams challenge effective knowledge transfer in non-stationary environments.

Method: BR-MARLENE facilitates knowledge transfer across labels, while BRPW-MARLENE adds pairwise label dependency modeling for enhanced adaptation.

Result: Both methods outperform current state-of-the-art techniques in multi-label data stream tasks in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Inter-label knowledge transfer significantly improves predictive performance in multi-label non-stationary data streams.

Abstract: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift in
non-stationary environments, either independently or in relation to other
labels. Transferring knowledge between related labels can accelerate
adaptation, yet research on multi-label transfer learning for data streams
remains limited. To address this, we propose two novel transfer learning
methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source
and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE builds on this
by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to enhance
learning performance. Comprehensive experiments show that both methods
outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary
environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of inter-label knowledge transfer
for improved predictive performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers were analyzed for their ability to handle variable causal structures in token sequences dynamically through the development of Selective Induction Heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how transformers deal with dynamic causal dependencies in natural language, which are more complex than fixed structures.

Method: It introduces a framework varying causal structures with interleaved Markov Chains and analyzes Selective Induction Heads that enable transformers to pick the correct causal paths.

Result: Authors show that transformers can learn to dynamically identify proper causal lags for token prediction, implementing Selective Induction Heads with theoretical and empirical evidence.

Conclusion: The study enhances interpretability of transformers, highlighting their capability to handle adaptive causal structures for improved understanding of sequence modeling.

Abstract: Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling
tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this
success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens
based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal
structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of
induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and
learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal
structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the
relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our
framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with
different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting
unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows
transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure
in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism
to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the
corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a
3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a
theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to
the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how
transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their
functioning and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the efficiency and accuracy of reduced-order models (ROMs) over long time horizons for solving parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs).

Method: The authors introduce a high-order finite-difference scheme combined with a Rollout loss to train ROMs for accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons.

Result: The approach was validated using the 2D Burgers equation, showing effective performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the predictive power of ROMs for parameterized PDEs, addressing challenges in long-term prediction accuracy while remaining computationally efficient.

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical
sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods.
Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction
to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized
families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We
address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive
finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to
make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our
approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the communication bottleneck that hinders the efficiency of distributed and federated learning, particularly when handling decentralized data sources while maintaining privacy.

Method: The authors propose a unified framework for compression operators and develop adaptive local training strategies with personalization. Novel methods like Scafflix, Cohort-Squeeze, and SymWanda are introduced to optimize communication and training efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper offers practical and theoretical insights into improving distributed learning efficiency, paving the way for scalable and more communication-efficient systems in decentralized environments.

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are essential paradigms for training

communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. This dissertation explores
strategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,
local training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for
biased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then
propose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to
accelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix
balances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance
under both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving
pruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,
with Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device
overhead. Finally, SymWanda, a symmetric post-training pruning method, enhances
robustness under high sparsity and maintains accuracy without retraining.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks and large-scale language models demonstrate
favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication, offering
theoretical and practical insights for scalable, efficient distributed
learning.

*Xiaolong Luo,Michael Lingzhi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The CRITICAL dataset offers an unprecedented scale and diversity, capturing comprehensive patient data across pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU settings from multiple sites, and is processed using CRISP for efficient, standardized ML-readiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing critical care datasets like MIMIC and eICU lack diversity and comprehensive patient journeys, hindering generalizable predictive modeling and health equity research, which CRITICAL aims to solve.

Method: The paper introduces CRISP, a pipeline that preprocesses CRITICAL's data by standardizing vocabularies, managing data quality, optimizing modular architecture for efficiency, and providing benchmarks for clinical prediction tasks.

Result: CRISP successfully transformed raw heterogeneous data into unified ML-ready datasets in less than one day, offering baseline model benchmarks and saving researchers significant preprocessing time.

Conclusion: CRISP democratizes access to extensive critical care data by providing a transparent, efficient preprocessing pipeline and facilitating advancements in clinical AI research.

Abstract: While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled
significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new
frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion
records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA
institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum
patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both
inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal
perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable
predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness
of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data
harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary
usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource.
CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data
quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary
mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards,
with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with
parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on
standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks
spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible
performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline
implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves
researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to
large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on
advancing clinical AI.

### [145] [Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models with Forgetting-aware Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08255)
*Wei Huang,Anda Cheng,Yinggui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM) to address Catastrophic Forgetting in large language models by optimizing weight pruning based on task vector overlap with pre-trained parameters, achieving minimal forgetting with high task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models exhibit impressive task capabilities but suffer from Catastrophic Forgetting when fine-tuned for downstream tasks. This paper aims to mitigate CF without altering training processes or architectures.

Method: The study proposes FAPM, a pruning metric that uses the ratio of task vector to pre-trained model parameters to evaluate CF. This metric is integrated into pruning criteria without requiring auxiliary data or process modifications.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets reveal that FAPM reduces CF to 0.25% while maintaining a high accuracy of 99.67% on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: FAPM effectively addresses CF in LLM fine-tuning without additional complexity, showing its viability and effectiveness across varied datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the
Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to
balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from
the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model
parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%
accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on understanding 2D physics, showing varied performance across four consistent domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and assess the capacity of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand fundamental scientific principles, particularly physics.

Method: The authors create a pragmatic scenario generator, testing VLMs on over 400 problems across Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics, Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics.

Result: Evaluation shows a strong correlation between model scale and reasoning ability. The best model achieved a score of 0.815, but abstract spatial reasoning remains a difficulty for all models.

Conclusion: The framework provides a platform for advancing the study of scientific reasoning in VLMs and understanding their strengths and weaknesses.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to
perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at
many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics,
remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these
capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to
rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework
features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over
400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics,
Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four
state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale
and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving
an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic
problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial
reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of
scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities
and limitations.

TL;DR: The study introduces a rainfall forecasting framework in Vietnam, using a Matrix Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE) approach that outperforms existing models in accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam faces challenges due to climatic diversity and geographical variability, yet it is critical for flood management, hydropower, and disaster preparedness.

Method: The paper proposes MPWE, a regime-switching framework that incorporates covariant dependencies and redundancy-aware weighting to enhance predictions across geographical models.

Result: MPWE exhibited superior performance in accuracy and stability over various forecast horizons, compared to baseline ensembles and geographical models, in eight river basins in Vietnam.

Conclusion: MPWE proves to be an effective and reliable approach for rainfall forecasting, offering substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and stability.

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse
climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins,
yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower
operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix
Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that
dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model
forecasts while incorporating redundancy-aware weighting to balance
contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from
eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and
accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results
show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of
prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines,
demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FoQuS, a method that reduces the training data requirements for deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) models while maintaining high accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training AMR models is resource-intensive due to the need for massive labeled datasets, making it challenging during tasks like hyperparameter tuning or new model development.

Method: FoQuS selects a coreset—representative subset—of the original dataset by recording prediction trajectories during full-dataset training and computing three importance metrics based on training dynamics.

Result: FoQuS achieves high recognition accuracy and generalization using only 1%-30% of the original dataset across multiple AMR datasets.

Conclusion: FoQuS effectively reduces the training overhead of AMR models while maintaining performance, providing a scalable and energy-efficient solution.

Abstract: Deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model has made
significant progress with the support of large-scale labeled data. However,
when developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and
energy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of
data are often unbearable. To address the above challenges, we propose
\emph{FoQuS}, which approximates the effect of full training by selecting a
coreset from the original dataset, thereby significantly reducing training
overhead. Specifically, \emph{FoQuS} records the prediction trajectory of each
sample during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics
based on training dynamics. Experiments show that \emph{FoQuS} can maintain
high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization on
multiple AMR datasets using only 1\%-30\% of the original data.

*Bohan Yu,Yekun Chai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvolKV is a novel framework for optimizing key-value (KV) cache compression, surpassing heuristic methods with up to 7% improvement, while significantly reducing memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identified that existing heuristic-based KV cache compression methods fail to account for the interplay between layer-specific patterns and task performance, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

Method: EvolKV uses evolutionary search to dynamically allocate layer-wise cache budgets with the goal of simultaneously optimizing memory efficiency and task performance.

Result: EvolKV outperformed baseline methods across 11 tasks, with notable achievements including a 7% improvement on GSM8K and using only 1.5% of the memory budget in code completion while exceeding full-cache performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of adaptive, task-aware compression techniques like EvolKV, demonstrating a significant leap in both performance and memory efficiency for KV cache allocation.

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

### [150] [Accelerating Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Convergence using Pre-trained Large Language Models as Tutors With Advice Reusing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08329)
*Lukas Toral,Teddy Lazebnik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) as tutors can accelerate reinforcement learning (RL) training, demonstrating notable improvements while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lengthy training durations of RL algorithms in complex, sparse-reward environments, where existing techniques are problem-specific and require domain expertise.

Method: The authors employ a student-teacher setup where LLMs tutor RL algorithms. They investigate the impact of this guidance on RL convergence through 54 configurations with varying RL algorithms, LLM tutors, and environments.

Result: LLM tutoring was found to significantly reduce RL training time while retaining optimal performance. Reusing LLM advice improves training speed further, though at the cost of stability in convergence dynamics.

Conclusion: LLM-based tutoring enhances RL convergence speed and shows potential effectiveness, though its impact depends on the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model used.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become
useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While
techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate
training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's
professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this
challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL
algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster
convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's
advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical
examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,
PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,
Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly
accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.
Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training
duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings
suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness
is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

### [151] [Accelerating Mixture-of-Expert Inference with Adaptive Expert Split Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08342)
*Jiaming Yan,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Liusheng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoEpic is an optimized MoE inference system using an expert split mechanism and adaptive caching strategies to substantially reduce GPU memory demands and inference latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in adopting Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures for large language models (LLMs), particularly the massive GPU memory demands that make their inference inefficient and less accessible.

Method: MoEpic introduces an expert split mechanism, dividing each expert into top and bottom segments, and caches the top segments of frequently used ('hot') experts. This increases cache efficiency and reduces data fetching latency. It also employs a fixed-point iteration based divide-and-conquer algorithm for adaptive cache configurations.

Result: MoEpic reduces GPU memory costs by almost 50% and decreases inference latency by 37.51% to 65.73%, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MoEpic effectively mitigates the computational and memory constraints of MoE inference systems, enabling more efficient and accessible deployment of large language models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU
memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.
Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches
typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch
experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in
inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading
latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the
performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each
layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a
divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache
configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that
MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference
latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

### [152] [Prediction Loss Guided Decision-Focused Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08359)
*Haeun Jeon,Hyunglip Bae,Chanyeong Kim,Yongjae Lee,Woo Chang Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a combined gradient approach to stabilize training in decision-focused learning and improve decision-making under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches in decision-making under uncertainty (PFL and DFL) have issues—PFL overlooks decision quality, while DFL struggles with unstable convergence.

Method: The paper introduces a method that perturbs the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient and employs a sigmoid-like decaying parameter for guidance, requiring no additional training.

Result: The method showed improved stability and decision quality across three stochastic optimization problems, outperforming both PFL and DFL approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves lower regret and more stable training, making it effective even in scenarios where the baseline methods fail.

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:
predicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on
predictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these
two stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive
model by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.
However, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often
suffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In
contrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream
decision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:
perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to
construct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and
can be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying
parameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient
to train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild
assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic
optimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.
We validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,
even in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.

*Kosuke Kihara,Junki Mori,Taiki Miyagawa,Akinori F. Ebihara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new FL framework, CI-FFREEDA, that addresses class imbalance and label shift issues. It demonstrates the use of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as feature extractors to enhance accuracy and efficiency, showing their significant advantage over complex adaptation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in Federated Learning arising from class imbalances and label shifts between clients and domains, a challenge not adequately handled by current methods.

Method: The study involved replacing traditional FFREEDA backbones with frozen Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to analyze their effectiveness in mitigating challenges such as domain gaps, class imbalances, and non-IID data.

Result: Experimental findings show that VFMs significantly boost accuracy, reduce computational costs, and handle issues of class imbalance and non-IID-ness among clients.

Conclusion: Strong feature extractors like VFMs are more crucial than complex FL adaptations for real-world FL scenarios involving class imbalances and domain adaptation challenges.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a framework for training models
collaboratively while preserving data privacy of each client. Recently,
research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a
more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains
unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during
pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:
Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class
imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts
between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing
methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing
aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors
within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a
frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy
without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication
costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs
effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even
non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,
not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.

*Matan Avitan,Moran Baruch,Nir Drucker,Itamar Zimerman,Yoav Goldberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses enhancing privacy-preserving neural text generation using homomorphic encryption with novel methods for efficient text decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the issue of performing sensitive data processing using large language models (LLMs) on untrusted servers while preserving privacy, aiming to optimize homomorphic encryption techniques for neural text decoding.

Method: The work introduces cutmax, a homomorphic encryption-friendly argmax algorithm for efficient greedy decoding, and an HE-compatible nucleus sampling method based on cutmax for efficient stochastic text generation.

Result: The proposed methods reduce ciphertext operations, achieve rapid convergence, and significantly improve inference efficiency, demonstrating 24x-35x latency reductions compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The techniques facilitate practical and privacy-preserving text generation under homomorphic encryption, with the potential to enable more secure and efficient AI applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

*Xunkai Li,Daohan Su,Sicheng Liu,Ru Zhang,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies two key pitfalls in graph foundation models (GFMs) and proposes a solution called MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) to address these issues, achieving strong performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph foundation models (GFMs) face challenges in simultaneous encoding of graph topologies and textual attributes from multiple domains, and they struggle with issues like model degradation and representation collapse, impacting their generalizability.

Method: The authors propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers), which includes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy, a mixture-of-codebooks, domain-aware routing to enhance information capacity, and additional regularizations to address optimization bottlenecks.

Result: MoT achieves significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrated on 22 datasets spanning 6 domains in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: By addressing information bottlenecks and regularization deficits, MoT improves GFM performance and scalability, helping overcome critical optimization challenges.

Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to
learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream
cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE
stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This
is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes
from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic
boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause
imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are
just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model
Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;
Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail
to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation
subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and
generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.

Result: The VLM outperformed the CNN in classification tasks, demonstrated higher flexibility in integrating textual or semantic information, and provided more interpretable predictions.

Conclusion: VLMs offer significant advantages as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification due to their superior performance, interpretability, and ability to incorporate multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating

Motivation: The need for a model that combines the predictive power of neural networks with interpretability crucial for general insurance pricing.

Method: The model assigns neural subnetworks to covariates and interactions with constraints for interpretability and practical insurance requirements.

Result: The model outperformed traditional actuarial and state-of-the-art machine learning methods in prediction accuracy across datasets.

Conclusion: The Actuarial Neural Additive Model achieves a balance between transparency and prediction accuracy, validating its use for insurance applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently
interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers
fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong
predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural
network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction
term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing
various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g.
sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in
insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid
foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within
the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework.
Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial
and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real
insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other
methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal
logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.

Motivation: Event log characteristics significantly impact process mining algorithm metrics, but prior studies lacked systematic and associational analyses.

Method: Developed SHAining, a method to quantify the marginal impact of individual event log characteristics using over 22,000 logs and metrics like fitness, precision, and complexity.

Result: Identified which event log characteristics most affect metrics and provided insights on the correlation between the characteristics' values and their algorithmic impact.

Conclusion: SHAining contributes to understanding and improving algorithm robustness by highlighting specific impactful event log characteristics on process mining tasks.

Abstract: Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights from event logs, yet
algorithm metric results vary widely depending on structural event log
characteristics. Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of
real-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log
characteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on
associational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping
individual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated
causal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,
the first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log
characteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics. Using process discovery
as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000 event logs covering a wide span of
characteristics to uncover which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g.,
fitness, precision, complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights
about how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm's robustness.

### [159] [Generative Data Refinement: Just Ask for Better Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08653)
*Minqi Jiang,João G. M. Araújo,Will Ellsworth,Sian Gooding,Edward Grefenstette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Data Refinement (GDR), a framework to refine datasets by using generative models, enhancing their safety, usability, and diversity for training large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that training data availability is becoming a bottleneck as datasets grow faster than web-indexed data, risking data scarcity in future years. Additionally, much available data exists in unindexed forms but poses risks like privacy leaks and inappropriate content.

Method: The proposed GDR framework uses pretrained generative models to transform a dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset. It involves generating synthetic data conditioned on real examples to match the diversity seen in large-scale datasets.

Result: GDR outperforms industry-grade anonymization tools and enables detoxification of unsafe datasets. The framework achieves comparable diversity to web-scale datasets without relying on ad-hoc model prompting techniques.

Conclusion: GDR is an effective and practical tool for scaling diverse, safe, and high-quality data for training advanced machine learning models, addressing a critical challenge in the field.

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentGym-RL, a framework for training large language model (LLM) agents to perform multi-turn decision-making via reinforcement learning (RL), without supervised fine-tuning. It also proposes ScalingInter-RL, an approach for balancing exploration and exploitation during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of a unified RL framework for training intelligent LLM agents from scratch across real-world tasks without relying on supervised fine-tuning.

Method: The study employs a modular AgentGym-RL framework that supports diverse real-world scenarios and mainstream RL algorithms. The ScalingInter-RL strategy is introduced to gradually shift the focus from exploitation to exploration during training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that agents trained using AgentGym-RL and ScalingInter-RL match or outperform commercial models across 27 tasks in diverse environments.

Conclusion: AgentGym-RL and ScalingInter-RL provide effective tools for RL-driven training of intelligent agents, empowering the research community with open-source code and datasets to further advance this field.

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent
decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

### [161] [Heart Disease Prediction: A Comparative Study of Optimisers Performance in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08499)
*Chisom Chibuike,Adeyinka Ogunsanya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares 10 optimizers on training a Multi-layer Perceptron model for heart disease prediction using Kaggle data. RMSProp is recommended for its balanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of emphasis on selecting optimizers for training deep learning models and establishing more scientific metrics for their selection.

Method: The authors evaluated 10 optimizers on a heart disease classification problem using a consistent training paradigm and evaluated metrics like convergence speed, stability, precision, recall, and AUC.

Result: RMSProp was identified as the most effective optimizer, achieving 0.765 precision, 0.827 recall, and 0.841 AUC with faster training time but lower stability.

Conclusion: The paper suggests adopting thorough evaluation methods to select optimizers, especially in non-compute-constrained environments, to improve training outcomes in deep learning models.

Abstract: Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training
deep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the
optimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper
into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that
determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10
different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a
heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and
evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and
stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such
as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification
problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed
and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,
took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be
the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it
offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of
0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.
However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less
compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a
thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and
performance in training deep learning models.

### [162] [Variational Rank Reduction Autoencoders for Generative](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08515)
*Alicia Tierz,Jad Mounayer,Beatriz Moya,Francisco Chinesta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework combining Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) to improve thermal design of complex geometries, addressing limitations of conventional generative models and high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address two key challenges in generative thermal design: high computational costs in high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional methods like autoencoders that produce unstructured and inconsistent solutions.

Method: The proposed method uses VRRAEs to create structured, interpretable latent spaces via truncated SVD, reducing collapse issues. DeepONets are employed to leverage the latent encoding and spatial coordinates for efficient and accurate prediction of temperature gradients.

Result: The hybrid framework improved both the quality of generated geometries and the accuracy of temperature gradient predictions while significantly enhancing inference efficiency over traditional numerical solvers.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining generative models and operator networks, highlighting their potential in thermal design and broader engineering applications by emphasizing structured latent representations for operator learning.

Abstract: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient graph-based active clustering algorithm that optimizes computational performance, reduces user input, and improves scalability for large-scale data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in computational cost, user input minimization, and memory usage for large-scale active clustering tasks.

Method: A graph-based algorithm with two sparse graphs: one modeling data relationships (data skeleton) and the other updating it to refine subgraphs into nested clusters.

Result: Empirical analysis shows more accurate clustering with reduced user constraints and significant improvements in performance and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for clustering with minimal user effort and better computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise
constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in
applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model
pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for
iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided
constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)
to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we
propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse
graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data
skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in
concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data
skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the
proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with
dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its
counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while
maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a framework for effectively incorporating reasoning capabilities from multiple teachers into a student model, achieving superior performance on math benchmarks and demonstrating additional benefits like improved general reasoning and teacher quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the limitations of single-teacher distillation in reasoning tasks and the availability of diverse teachers and large CoT corpora.

Method: The MoT framework alternates between teacher-specific fine-tuning and weight-space merging of student models trained under different teachers.

Result: MoT surpasses state-of-the-art reasoning models, outperforms single-teacher and multi-teacher distillation baselines, mitigates overfitting, and enhances model robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: MoT offers a scalable and effective approach for distilling diverse reasoning capabilities into compact student models, improving reasoning performance across tasks while cultivating more versatile reasoning skills.

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAESTRO is an advanced multi-modal ensemble framework designed for robust influenza forecasting by integrating surveillance, web trends, and meteorological data into a spectro-temporal architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve influenza incidence forecasting for timely public health responses by utilizing multi-modal data and advanced modeling methods.

Method: MAESTRO uses multi-modal data sources, decomposes time series into seasonal/trend components, and processes them via Transformer-based encoders, a state-space model, temporal convolutions, and frequency-domain analysis combined with cross-channel attention for forecasting.

Result: The model was evaluated on 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data and achieved state-of-the-art performance with an R-square of 0.956.

Conclusion: MAESTRO demonstrates the importance of combining spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data for robust epidemiological forecasting, and the pipeline is publicly available for broader use and adaptation.

Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public
health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal
Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves
robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web
search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive
spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into
seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid
feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba
state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal
convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention
mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.
Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,
with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on
over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),
MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model
fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.
Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal
fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible
pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to
other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a
powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced
spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust
epidemiological forecasting.

### [166] [Interpretability as Alignment: Making Internal Understanding a Design Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08592)
*Aadit Sengupta,Pratinav Seth,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes making interpretability, especially mechanistic approaches, a central principle in AI alignment rather than a supplementary tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large neural models are being used in critical applications, but their behavior often lacks alignment with human values, raising ethical and safety concerns.

Method: The authors differentiate between post-hoc interpretability tools like LIME/SHAP and mechanistic methods such as circuit tracing/activation patching, highlighting the causal insights offered by mechanistic approaches.

Result: Mechanistic interpretability can identify internal failures that other behavioral metrics (e.g., RLHF, red teaming) might miss, emphasizing its importance in ensuring trustworthy AI.

Conclusion: The future of safe and trustworthy AI requires prioritizing interpretability in AI research, ensuring systems are transparent, auditable, and aligned with human values.

Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings,
raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human
values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing
the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially
mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment,
not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer
intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like
circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal
failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods
like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these
advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic
uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts.
Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making
interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development,
ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent,
and aligned with human intent.

### [167] [Classification of 24-hour movement behaviors from wrist-worn accelerometer data: from handcrafted features to deep learning techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08606)
*Alireza Sameh,Mehrdad Rostami,Mourad Oussalah,Vahid Farrahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study compared deep learning (DL) and classical machine learning (ML) algorithms for categorizing 24-hour movement behavior intensities using wrist-worn accelerometer data, finding that DL methods slightly outperformed classical ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to assess whether deep learning algorithms using raw accelerometer signals can perform better than classical machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features for classifying movement behavior intensities.

Method: Using data from 151 adults, raw acceleration signals were segmented and handcrafted features extracted. Four DL methods (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, 1D-CNN) were trained on raw signals and handcrafted features, while six classical ML methods (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, ANN, Decision Tree) were trained on handcrafted features.

Result: DL methods using raw signals achieved approximately 85% accuracy, outperforming classical ML methods trained on handcrafted features which achieved 70-81% accuracy. Confusion was higher for MVPA and LPA categories compared to sleep and sedentary categories.

Conclusion: DL algorithms using raw signals offer slightly better classification accuracy for movement behaviors compared to algorithms trained on handcrafted features. However, the improvements are marginal, especially for certain movement categories.

Abstract: Purpose: We compared the performance of deep learning (DL) and classical
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of 24-hour movement
behavior into sleep, sedentary, light intensity physical activity (LPA), and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Open-access
data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.
Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets
(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented
into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted
features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw
acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals
to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were
also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression
(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying
24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an
overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration
signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on
handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML
algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in
classification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.
Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better
performance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to
when DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XNNTab is an interpretable neural architecture for tabular data combining sparse autoencoders for feature extraction and semantic assignment without sacrificing predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep neural networks for tabular data lack interpretability despite their strong predictive capabilities, which hinders practical understanding and application in critical fields like finance and healthcare.

Method: XNNTab employs a sparse autoencoder to create monosemantic features and assigns human-interpretable semantics to them through an automated procedure, enabling straightforward interpretation of predictions.

Result: XNNTab matches or surpasses the performance of cutting-edge black-box neural networks and classical machine learning methods while offering full interpretability.

Conclusion: This research resolves the longstanding trade-off between interpretability and predictive accuracy in tabular data models, making XNNTab a robust and transparent tool for sensitive fields.

Abstract: Tabular data is the foundation of many applications in fields such as finance
and healthcare. Although DNNs tailored for tabular data achieve competitive
predictive performance, they are blackboxes with little interpretability. We
introduce XNNTab, a neural architecture that uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to
learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for
prediction. Using an automated method, we assign human-interpretable semantics
to these features. This allows us to represent predictions as linear
combinations of semantically meaningful components. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that XNNTab attains performance on par with or exceeding that of
state-of-the-art, black-box neural models and classical machine learning
approaches while being fully interpretable.

### [169] [An upper bound of the silhouette validation metric for clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08625)
*Hugo Sträng,Tai Dinh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for calculating a data-dependent upper bound on the silhouette width, addressing limitations in clustering quality evaluation by providing more realistic upper limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering quality measures like average silhouette width (ASW) often lack dataset-specific maximum values and use an upper limit of 1, which is not always achievable.

Method: The authors derive a sharp upper bound on silhouette width for individual data points and aggregate these bounds to obtain a canonical, data-specific upper bound on ASW.

Result: Their proposed bounds are provably near-tight on both synthetic and real datasets, allowing improved evaluation and insights into cluster quality.

Conclusion: The bounds enhance clustering evaluation by revealing potential placements for data points, enabling early optimization stopping, and indicating proximity to optimal clustering outcomes.

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient summarizes, per observation, cohesion versus
separation in [-1, 1]; the average silhouette width (ASW) is a common internal
measure of clustering quality where higher values indicate more coveted
results. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and
the standard upper limit 1 is often unattainable. In this work, we derive for
each data point in a given dataset a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width.
By aggregating these individual bounds, we present a canonical data-dependent
upper bound on ASW that often assumes values well below 1. The presented bounds
can indicate whether individual data points can ever be well placed, enable
early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and help answer a key
question: How close is my clustering result to the best possible outcome on
this specific data? Across synthetic and real datasets, the bounds are provably
near-tight in many cases and offer significant enrichment of cluster quality
evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper addresses replicability in machine learning, introducing methods for reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replication of results is challenging across scientific disciplines, including machine learning, especially in reinforcement learning where algorithms are unstable.

Method: The authors developed efficient algorithms for replicable random design regression and uncentered covariance estimation, applying them to create replicable RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes.

Result: Provably efficient replicable RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes were introduced, experimentally validated, and shown to inspire consistent neural policies.

Conclusion: This work advances replicable RL algorithms in linear function approximation and provides tools of independent interest, contributing toward more stable and replicable methods in RL.

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many
scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on
the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that
an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different
samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are
especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are
known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular
RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function
approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make
progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in
RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design
regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest.
We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable
RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model
and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and
show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

*Jingya Cheng,Jiazi Tian,Federica Spoto,Alaleh Azhir,Daniel Mork,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the degradation of machine learning models in healthcare due to inconsistent diagnostic data quality and proposes a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) and calibration method to improve performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenge of distributional shifts in machine learning models used for Electronic Health Records (EHR), specifically due to diagnostic signal decay, which undermines model reliability across institutions.

Method: The authors developed a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) with six interpretable components to quantify diagnostic data quality and applied an SFI-aware calibration method optimized through a simulation framework of synthetic dementia datasets for calibration adjustments.

Result: SFI-aware calibration significantly improved prediction metrics across heterogeneous datasets, with increases in Balanced Accuracy (10.3%), Recall (32.5%), Precision (31.9%), F1-score (26.1%), and improvements in metrics nearing reference standards.

Conclusion: Diagnostic signal decay is a resolvable issue that affects model generalization, and the proposed SFI-aware calibration method offers a robust label-free solution to enhance predictions in datasets lacking outcome labels.

Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy
to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, particularly for large-scale
administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a torus-based secure parameter aggregation method for federated learning that provides perfect privacy and avoids accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Secure aggregation using traditional finite field computations faces inherent challenges like fixed-point arithmetic tradeoffs and information leakage risk with real-valued data in federated learning.

Method: The authors propose utilizing a torus for secure aggregation, taking advantage of its uniform distribution to ensure perfect privacy and eliminating accuracy degradation associated with finite field approaches.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed torus-based protocol has comparable performance to models without secure aggregation, surpasses finite field methods in accuracy and cosine similarity, all while ensuring privacy.

Conclusion: The torus-based method is presented as a more accurate and safer choice for privacy-preserving federated learning compared to finite field techniques.

Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their
parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global
model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,
secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to
enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a
uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a
problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals
that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is
bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,
but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due
to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can
simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel
secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather
than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's
data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding
accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs
similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect
privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based
protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model
accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

*James Gong,Raymond Luo,Emma Wang,Leon Ge,Bruce Li,Felix Marattukalam,Waleed Abdulla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FAUST, an enhanced version of the Forward-Forward algorithm, which increases accuracy through similarity learning frameworks while maintaining inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation is successful but has biological and functional limitations, prompting the need for an alternative like the Forward-Forward algorithm.

Method: FAUST integrates the Forward-Forward algorithm with similarity-based tuplet loss to remove the need for multiple forward passes during inference.

Result: FAUST improves accuracy on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. On CIFAR-10, it reaches 56.22% accuracy, close to backpropagation's 57.63%.

Conclusion: FAUST is a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation, offering improved accuracy and efficiency on key datasets.

Abstract: Backpropagation is the pivotal algorithm underpinning the success of
artificial neural networks, yet it has critical limitations such as
biologically implausible backward locking and global error propagation. To
circumvent these constraints, the Forward-Forward algorithm was proposed as a
more biologically plausible method that replaces the backward pass with an
additional forward pass. Despite this advantage, the Forward-Forward algorithm
significantly trails backpropagation in accuracy, and its optimal form exhibits
low inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes required. In this work,
the Forward-Forward algorithm is reshaped through its integration with
similarity learning frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward
passes during inference. This proposed algorithm is named Forward-Forward
Algorithm Unified with Similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). Empirical
evaluations on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FAUST
substantially improves accuracy, narrowing the gap with backpropagation. On
CIFAR-10, FAUST achieves 56.22\% accuracy with a simple multi-layer perceptron
architecture, approaching the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63\% accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a three-layered architecture (Log Investigation, Anomaly Detection, and Root Cause Analysis) to help DevOps teams efficiently address IT system failures and enhance reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of IT systems makes it challenging to ensure stability and reliability, necessitating improved failure detection and resolution mechanisms.

Method: The paper proposes a three-layered architecture: (1) Log Investigation for autonomous log labeling and anomaly classification, (2) Anomaly Detection based on adaptable methods, and (3) Root Cause Analysis to identify failure sources and key events.

Result: The system demonstrated impressive results: F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0 for Anomaly Detection and 90-98% accuracy in identifying root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates in Root Cause Analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture enhances the efficiency and reliability of DevOps teams by providing robust methods to analyze logs, detect anomalies, and trace root causes of system failures.

Abstract: In the evolving IT landscape, stability and reliability of systems are
essential, yet their growing complexity challenges DevOps teams in
implementation and maintenance. Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides
critical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation
introduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure
resolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log
labeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data
without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of
anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies
into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,
Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a
flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,
and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show
F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third
layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,
their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying
key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of
root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable
insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be
designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By
integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust
methods to enhance IT system reliability.

*Nikasadat Emami,Amirhossein Khalilian-Gourtani,Jianghao Qian,Antoine Ratouchniak,Xupeng Chen,Yao Wang,Adeen Flinker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study develops machine learning models to identify brain regions critical for speech, using intracranial ECoG data to predict speech-arrest zones mapped by invasive Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods, such as ESM, are invasive and time-intensive, creating the need for alternative approaches to safely map cortical regions critical for speech during brain surgery.

Method: The authors analyzed ECoG data from 16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning classifiers based on neural signals, anatomical labels, and connectivity features. Performance was validated against ground truth ESM labels.

Result: Models combining spatial region and network features outperformed simpler models, achieving strong ROC-AUC and PR-AUC scores on unseen participants. The best model utilized an RBF-kernel SVM for trial-level predictions and an MLP for aggregation.

Conclusion: Integrating neural signals, anatomical information, and connectivity features with machine learning offers an effective non-invasive alternative to ESM for presurgical functional brain mapping.

Abstract: Identifying cortical regions critical for speech is essential for safe brain
surgery in or near language areas. While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)
remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To
address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from
16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models
to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is
critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived
independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train
classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,
anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both
local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining
region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature
set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each
electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to
histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel
Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong
accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings
highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with
non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.

### [176] [Securing Private Federated Learning in a Malicious Setting: A Scalable TEE-Based Approach with Client Auditing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08709)
*Shun Takagi,Satoshi Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a solution to enable maliciously secure differentially private federated learning by introducing a trusted computing base (TCB) using ephemeral trusted execution environments (TEE) to remove semi-honest server assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to cross-device private federated learning rely on a semi-honest server assumption, which compromises security in practical scenarios involving client dropouts or corruptions.

Method: The paper implements a novel server extension using ephemeral TEE modules for verifiable server actions, coupled with client auditing to ensure privacy and security.

Result: The proposed framework maintains scalability and liveness, introduces minimal computational and communication overheads, and provides formal interactive differential privacy guarantees in malicious settings.

Conclusion: This solution addresses the challenges posed by semi-honest server assumptions by securely leveraging ephemeral TEEs, while minimizing audit-related overhead and preserving system integrity.

Abstract: In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private
follow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest
server and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this
assumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly
problematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.
While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious
solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or
availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper
introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)
to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral
TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.
Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with
small additional communication and computational demands. This extension
solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability
and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential
privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we
experimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients
in several realistic settings.

### [177] [Compressing CNN models for resource-constrained systems by channel and layer pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08714)
*Ahmed Sadaqa,Di Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid pruning framework combining channel and layer pruning to compress Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), achieving lower complexity and latency with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity and size of CNNs make deploying them on edge devices challenging, necessitating effective model compression techniques.

Method: A hybrid pruning framework inspired by EfficientNet's scaling principles but applied in reverse for pruning both channels and layers.

Result: The hybrid pruning approach achieved significant complexity reduction and lower latency on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2, while maintaining minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: This hybrid pruning framework enhances efficiency for edge device deployment without heavily sacrificing model accuracy.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant breakthroughs
in various fields. However, these advancements have led to a substantial
increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge
when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model
compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and
complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model
pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both
channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework".
Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up
networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies
the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through
pruning. Experiments on the hybrid approach demonstrated a notable decrease in
the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy
compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into
reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2
embedded AI device.

TL;DR: SAPO is a decentralized RL algorithm designed to enhance language models' reasoning capabilities, while addressing scaling challenges and removing dependency on homogeneous hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL techniques for post-training language models face challenges like latency, memory issues, and high financial costs during scale-up.

Method: SAPO is fully decentralized, enabling nodes to share rollouts asynchronously without assuming homogeneity in hardware or latency, fostering independent operation and learning propagation.

Result: SAPO achieved significant cumulative reward gains (up to 94%) in controlled experiments, and succeeded on a diverse network of thousands of nodes contributed by the Gensyn community.

Conclusion: This approach allows scalable RL post-training with reduced bottlenecks, leveraging decentralized networks to enhance language models effectively without hardware constraints.

Abstract: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

*Andreas Burger,Luca Thiede,Alán Aspuru-Guzik,Nandita Vijaykumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel deep equilibrium model for molecular dynamics simulations, improving performance by leveraging the continuity of molecular states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for molecular dynamics lack accuracy, and most machine learning methods so far have focused only on symmetries, neglecting the continuity of successive molecular states.

Method: The authors adapt a state-of-the-art equivariant base model into a deep equilibrium model to recycle intermediate neural network features from previous time steps.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 10%-20% improvement in accuracy and speed on benchmark datasets (MD17, MD22, OC20 200k) and is more memory-efficient in training.

Conclusion: Exploiting molecular system continuity enhances model performance and scalability, showing promise for more accurate and efficient molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields show great promise in enabling more accurate
molecular dynamics simulations compared to manually derived ones. Much of the
progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about
physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and
reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of
prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular
system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely
similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by
recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium
model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from
previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by
$10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ
base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to
train more expressive models on larger systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChemBOMAS, an LLM-enhanced multi-agent system, accelerates Bayesian optimization in chemistry by combining knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained optimization, achieving superior results compared to domain experts in real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in Bayesian optimization for chemistry, caused by sparse experimental data and intricate reaction mechanisms, by introducing a novel framework to improve effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: ChemBOMAS incorporates LLMs to divide the vast chemical search space into manageable regions and uses pseudo-data generation for improved optimization. Two synergistic strategies are employed: knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained optimization.

Result: ChemBOMAS significantly outperformed various existing BO algorithms in benchmarks and achieved a 96% optimal objective value in wet-lab experiments targeting a challenging chemical reaction, compared to 15% by domain experts.

Conclusion: ChemBOMAS is validated as a robust tool for accelerating chemical discovery, showcasing both strong benchmark performance and industry application success in optimizing complex chemical reactions.

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered
by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced
Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization
process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:
knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained
optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,
LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing
chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in
the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process
within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark
evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical
discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduced a deep reinforcement learning AI agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during mass casualty incidents (MCIs) and validated its effectiveness in improving decision quality through simulations and user studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare systems are often overwhelmed during mass casualty incidents, necessitating efficient patient-hospital allocation under stressful conditions. The need for improved tools to optimize decision-making in such scenarios motivated this study.

Method: The researchers developed an AI agent using deep reinforcement learning to balance factors like patient acuity, hospital capacity, and transport logistics. They integrated it into a web-based dashboard, MasTER, and evaluated its performance through controlled user studies with trauma experts and non-experts.

Result: The results showed that AI collaboration greatly improved decision consistency and quality. The AI agent outperformed trauma surgeons and enabled non-experts to match expert-level performance when assisted.

Conclusion: The AI-driven decision support approach has the potential to enhance preparedness training and the management of real-world emergency responses during MCIs.

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) overwhelm healthcare systems and demand rapid,
accurate patient-hospital allocation decisions under extreme pressure. Here, we
developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI
agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing
patient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and
transport logistics. To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a
web-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations. Through a
controlled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts and 24
non-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent
(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI
scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Results demonstrate that increasing AI
involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI
agent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to
achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their
significantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001). These findings
establish the potential for our AI-driven decision support to enhance both MCI
preparedness training and real-world emergency response management.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network architecture capable of representing multidimensional Fourier series for scientific computing problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing Fourier-inspired neural networks, which struggle to fully represent multidimensional, separable Fourier bases.

Method: The FLM employs a feedforward structure with cosine activation functions to learn series parameters, creating a problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to diverse functions.

Result: FLM demonstrated competitive or superior performance compared to existing architectures like SIREN and standard feedforward neural networks in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and optimal control problems (OCPs).

Conclusion: The FLM successfully provides a general-purpose architecture for Fourier representation, offering enhanced adaptability and effectiveness in multidimensional scientific computing tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network (NN)
architecture designed to represent a multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier
series. The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation
functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series
as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a
problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic
functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first
architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple
dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A
one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and
phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,
separable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we
evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,
including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the
performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established
architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.

Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and
deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside
emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge

TL;DR: This survey reviews recent advancements in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for optimization problems, creating a structured taxonomy and framework to classify their roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks a unified framework and taxonomy for using LLMs in optimization problems.

Method: The paper classifies research into modeling and solving optimization problems using LLMs, further dividing solving into LLM roles: stand-alone optimizers, embedded low-level components, and high-level tools for algorithm generation.

Result: Representative methods are analyzed, interdisciplinary applications are reviewed, and technical challenges and gaps in existing research are highlighted.

Conclusion: Directions for future work are suggested, emphasizing the development of self-evolving ecosystems for optimization and contrasting LLM-driven approaches with conventional techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning
capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization
problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. Despite rapid
progress, however, the field still lacks a unified synthesis and a systematic
taxonomy. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of
recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We
classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling
and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three
paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as
stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms,
and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category,
we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine
their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary
applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning.
By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key
limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for
developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization. An up-to-date

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for precise bottleneck evaluation in HPC applications using noise injection, enabling better understanding and optimization of performance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for bottleneck evaluation often lack precision or portability. This paper aims to develop a model-agnostic and instruction-accurate framework to identify bottlenecks in HPC applications more effectively.

Method: The framework analyzes HPC applications by injecting performance noise at the instruction level to classify programs as being bottlenecked by computation, data bandwidth, or latency. It is integrated with the LLVM toolchain for wide portability across architectures.

Result: The framework was validated on various hardware benchmarks and kernels, including detailed analysis of an SPMXV kernel. It successfully identified performance bottlenecks, which also facilitated hardware selection decisions such as between HBM and DDR memory systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the precision of bottleneck analysis and offers portability across architectures, making it a valuable tool for performance tuning in HPC applications and hardware optimization.

Abstract: Bottleneck evaluation plays a crucial part in performance tuning of HPC
applications, as it directly influences the search for optimizations and the
selection of the best hardware for a given code. In this paper, we introduce a
new model-agnostic, instruction-accurate framework for bottleneck analysis
based on performance noise injection. This method provides a precise analysis
that complements existing techniques, particularly in quantifying unused
resource slack. Specifically, we classify programs based on whether they are
limited by computation, data access bandwidth, or latency by injecting
additional noise instructions that target specific bottleneck sources. Our
approach is built on the LLVM compiler toolchain, ensuring easy portability
across different architectures and microarchitectures which constitutes an
improvement over many state-of-the-art tools. We validate our framework on a
range of hardware benchmarks and kernels, including a detailedstudy of a
sparse-matrix--vector product (SPMXV) kernel, where we successfully detect
distinct performance regimes. These insights further inform hardware selection,
as demonstrated by our comparative evaluation between HBM and DDR memory
systems.

Abstract: We present memshare\footnote{The Software package is published as a CRAN
package under https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=memshare, a package that
enables shared memory multicore computation in R by allocating buffers in C++
shared memory and exposing them to R through ALTREP views. We compare memshare
to SharedObject (Bioconductor) discuss semantics and safety, and report a 2x
speedup over SharedObject with no additional resident memory in a column wise
apply benchmark. Finally, we illustrate a downstream analytics use case:
feature selection by mutual information in which densities are estimated per
feature via Pareto Density Estimation (PDE). The analytical use-case is an RNA
seq dataset consisting of N=10,446 cases and d=19,637 gene expressions
requiring roughly n_threads * 10GB of memory in the case of using parallel R
sessions. Such and larger use-cases are common in big data analytics and make R
feel limiting sometimes which is mitigated by the addition of the library
presented in this work.

*Faruk Alpay,Taylan Alpay*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured prompting framework using XML tags for large language models (LLMs), focusing on grammar-constrained decoding, fixed-point semantics, and iterative human-AI interaction loops, backed by mathematical proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for schema-adherent and parseable outputs from large language models in real-world use cases.

Method: The authors establish a formal framework using XML prompting by defining a lattice structure for XML trees, employing context-free grammars for constraints, and leveraging mathematical proofs for steady-state protocols and convergence in iterative processes.

Result: The framework ensures that XML-based structured outputs are well-formed while maintaining task performance. It also offers practical human-AI interaction recipes like multi-step routines (e.g., plan, verify, revise) for deployment.

Conclusion: The research provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for XML-based prompting in LLMs, combining formal methods and practical deployment strategies to improve structured outputs and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Structured prompting with XML tags has emerged as an effective way to steer
large language models (LLMs) toward parseable, schema-adherent outputs in
real-world systems. We develop a logic-first treatment of XML prompting that
unifies (i) grammar-constrained decoding, (ii) fixed-point semantics over
lattices of hierarchical prompts, and (iii) convergent human-AI interaction
loops. We formalize a complete lattice of XML trees under a refinement order
and prove that monotone prompt-to-prompt operators admit least fixed points
(Knaster-Tarski) that characterize steady-state protocols; under a task-aware
contraction metric on trees, we further prove Banach-style convergence of
iterative guidance. We instantiate these results with context-free grammars
(CFGs) for XML schemas and show how constrained decoding guarantees
well-formedness while preserving task performance. A set of multi-layer
human-AI interaction recipes demonstrates practical deployment patterns,
including multi-pass "plan $\to$ verify $\to$ revise" routines and agentic tool
use. We provide mathematically complete proofs and tie our framework to recent
advances in grammar-aligned decoding, chain-of-verification, and programmatic
prompting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the modeling of robotic swarms by leveraging quantum mechanics concepts like probability amplitudes and density matrices.

Method: The swarm is represented as a mixed quantum state, described using a density matrix that remains consistent in size regardless of the number of robots.

Result: Proposed a framework that overcomes robot scalability challenges by using a fixed-size density matrix for swarm modeling.

Conclusion: The study integrates mixed quantum state concepts into swarm robotics and highlights potential avenues for expanding this research further.

Abstract: In a robotic swarm, parameters such as position and proximity to the target
can be described in terms of probability amplitudes. This idea led to recent
studies on a quantum approach to the definition of the swarm, including a
block-matrix representation. Here, we propose an advancement of the idea,
defining a swarm as a mixed quantum state, to be described with a density
matrix, whose size does not change with the number of robots. We end the

Result: Improved capabilities in sensor placement and reconstruction, providing users with visualization tools and practical code examples.

Conclusion: The updates enhance PySensors’ flexibility and robustness, making it suitable for broader applications and emerging challenges.

Abstract: PySensors is a Python package for selecting and placing a sparse set of
sensors for reconstruction and classification tasks. In this major update to
\texttt{PySensors}, we introduce spatially constrained sensor placement
capabilities, allowing users to enforce constraints such as maximum or exact
sensor counts in specific regions, incorporate predetermined sensor locations,
and maintain minimum distances between sensors. We extend functionality to
support custom basis inputs, enabling integration of any data-driven or
spectral basis. We also propose a thermodynamic approach that goes beyond a
single ``optimal'' sensor configuration and maps the complete landscape of
sensor interactions induced by the training data. This comprehensive view
facilitates integration with external selection criteria and enables assessment
of sensor replacement impacts. The new optimization technique also accounts for
over- and under-sampling of sensors, utilizing a regularized least squares
approach for robust reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate noise-induced
uncertainty quantification of the estimation error and provide visual
uncertainty heat maps to guide deployment decisions. To highlight these
additions, we provide a brief description of the mathematical algorithms and
theory underlying these new capabilities. We demonstrate the usage of new
features with illustrative code examples and include practical advice for
implementation across various application domains. Finally, we outline a
roadmap of potential extensions to further enhance the package's functionality
and applicability to emerging sensing challenges.

Conclusion: SVN-ICP is effective for precise pose estimation and uncertainty management, making it suitable for diverse environments and reducing manual intervention.

Abstract: This letter introduces SVN-ICP, a novel Iterative Closest Point (ICP)
algorithm with uncertainty estimation that leverages Stein Variational Newton
(SVN) on manifold. Designed specifically for fusing LiDAR odometry in
multisensor systems, the proposed method ensures accurate pose estimation and
consistent noise parameter inference, even in LiDAR-degraded environments. By
approximating the posterior distribution using particles within the Stein
Variational Inference framework, SVN-ICP eliminates the need for explicit noise
modeling or manual parameter tuning. To evaluate its effectiveness, we
integrate SVN-ICP into a simple error-state Kalman filter alongside an IMU and

Result: NetConEmb outperformed with a MedAE of $0.58 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s offline and 100% navigation success rate in both known and unknown environments.

Conclusion: NetConEmb demonstrates robust obstacle avoidance capabilities and outperforms other models in real-time navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is a critical component of the navigation stack required
for mobile robots to operate effectively in complex and unknown environments.
In this research, three end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were
trained and evaluated offline and deployed on a differential-drive mobile robot
for real-time obstacle avoidance to generate low-level steering commands from
synchronized color and depth images acquired by an Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D
camera in diverse environments. Offline evaluation showed that the NetConEmb
model achieved the best performance with a notably low MedAE of $0.58 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s. In comparison, the lighter NetEmb architecture adopted in this
study, which reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 25\%
and converges faster, produced comparable results with an RMSE of $21.68 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s, close to the $21.42 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s obtained by
NetConEmb. Real-time navigation further confirmed NetConEmb's robustness,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenges of performing simultaneous learning and coverage in multi-robot systems, especially in environments where the density function of interest is unknown and time-varying.

Method: The proposed framework integrates Random Feature GP (RFGP) and its online variant (O-RFGP) for scalable inference with Voronoi-based coverage control and an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy to refine learning and focus on critical regions.

Result: Simulations show the effectiveness of the framework in static scenarios and its applicability to dynamic, time-varying scenarios is validated through additional simulations and physical experiments.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, adaptive learning and coverage in multi-robot systems with theoretical guarantees, overcoming GP regression's limitations and demonstrating utility in dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for multi-robot systems to perform
simultaneous learning and coverage of the domain of interest characterized by
an unknown and potentially time-varying density function. To overcome the
limitations of Gaussian Process (GP) regression, we employ Random Feature GP
(RFGP) and its online variant (O-RFGP) that enables online and incremental
inference. By integrating these with Voronoi-based coverage control and Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy, a team of robots can adaptively focus
on important regions while refining the learned spatial field for efficient
coverage. Under mild assumptions, we provide theoretical guarantees and
evaluate the framework through simulations in time-invariant scenarios.
Furthermore, its effectiveness in time-varying settings is demonstrated through
additional simulations and a physical experiment.

*Houjian Yu,Zheming Zhou,Min Sun,Omid Ghasemalizadeh,Yuyin Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo,Arnie Sen,Changhyun Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OGRG introduces a method for robotic object grasping via natural language instructions, addressing limitations in ambiguous scenes and reliance on dense annotations. It utilizes vision-language fusion and depth-based reasoning to outperform baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve human-robot interaction by enabling robots to grasp objects based on natural language instructions, overcoming challenges like ambiguous object targeting and reliance on dense annotations.

Method: The paper proposes OGRG framework with components like a bi-directional vision-language fusion module and depth integration, allowing planar grasp poses and spatial reasoning in scenes with duplicated objects. It investigates two learning settings: Referring Grasp Synthesis and Referring Grasp Affordance.

Result: OGRG outperformed baselines in tabletop grasping tasks and demonstrated high accuracy, speed, and robustness under both supervised and weakly-supervised settings in simulation and real-world trials.

Conclusion: OGRG is a promising framework for natural-language-based robotic grasping that excels in complex scenes while being computationally efficient and effective under varying supervision levels.

Abstract: Enabling robots to grasp objects specified through natural language is
essential for effective human-robot interaction, yet it remains a significant
challenge. Existing approaches often struggle with open-form language
expressions and typically assume unambiguous target objects without duplicates.
Moreover, they frequently rely on costly, dense pixel-wise annotations for both
object grounding and grasp configuration. We present Attribute-based Object
Grounding and Robotic Grasping (OGRG), a novel framework that interprets
open-form language expressions and performs spatial reasoning to ground target
objects and predict planar grasp poses, even in scenes containing duplicated
object instances. We investigate OGRG in two settings: (1) Referring Grasp
Synthesis (RGS) under pixel-wise full supervision, and (2) Referring Grasp
Affordance (RGA) using weakly supervised learning with only single-pixel grasp
annotations. Key contributions include a bi-directional vision-language fusion
module and the integration of depth information to enhance geometric reasoning,
improving both grounding and grasping performance. Experiment results show that
OGRG outperforms strong baselines in tabletop scenes with diverse spatial
language instructions. In RGS, it operates at 17.59 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX
2080 Ti GPU, enabling potential use in closed-loop or multi-object sequential
grasping, while delivering superior grounding and grasp prediction accuracy
compared to all the baselines considered. Under the weakly supervised RGA
setting, OGRG also surpasses baseline grasp-success rates in both simulation
and real-robot trials, underscoring the effectiveness of its spatial reasoning
design. Project page: https://z.umn.edu/ogrg

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field (IUPF) framework for improving trajectory planning in autonomous driving that balances safety, efficiency, and computational scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing trajectory planning methods, which either are computationally expensive or rely on separate safety critics, and to effectively handle diverse driving behaviors.

Method: The proposed IUPF framework fuses benefit and risk fields into a unified model using a physics-inspired variational framework grounded in mean field game theory, leveraging stochastic differential equations for Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence.

Result: The framework ensures safe and smooth trajectories in lane-changing and overtaking scenarios while outperforming traditional baselines in adaptability and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: IUPF successfully addresses the challenges of interactive autonomous driving by integrating diverse driving behaviors into a unified model and ensuring high performance without additional safety modules.

Abstract: Interactive trajectory planning in autonomous driving must balance safety,
efficiency, and scalability under heterogeneous driving behaviors. Existing
methods often face high computational cost or rely on external safety critics.
To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field
(IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a
physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The
approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without
additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to
guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane
changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances,
generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional
optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and
computational efficiency.

### [195] [Risk-Bounded Multi-Agent Visual Navigation via Dynamic Budget Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08157)
*Viraj Parimi,Brian C. Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RB-CBS is a new multi-agent path planning method that balances safety and efficiency using dynamic risk allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current methods where overly conservative graph-pruning limits mission efficiency in risky regions.

Method: Propose RB-CBS, an extension of Conflict-Based Search (CBS), which dynamically allocates risk bounds among agents for efficient navigation.

Result: Experimental results show RB-CBS improves navigation efficiency while adhering to safety constraints in complex environments.

Conclusion: RB-CBS achieves better mission efficiency compared to traditional approaches by flexibly balancing risk and safety.

Abstract: Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous
environments, especially when multiple agents must coordinate using just visual
inputs over extended time horizons. Traditional planning methods excel at
solving long-horizon tasks but rely on predefined distance metrics, while safe
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors using high-dimensional
inputs yet struggles with multi-agent, goal-conditioned scenarios. Recent work
combined these paradigms by leveraging goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) to build an
intermediate graph from replay buffer states, pruning unsafe edges, and using
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) for multi-agent path planning. Although effective,
this graph-pruning approach can be overly conservative, limiting mission
efficiency by precluding missions that must traverse high-risk regions. To
address this limitation, we propose RB-CBS, a novel extension to CBS that
dynamically allocates and adjusts user-specified risk bound ($\Delta$) across
agents to flexibly trade off safety and speed. Our improved planner ensures
that each agent receives a local risk budget ($\delta$) enabling more efficient
navigation while still respecting overall safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that this iterative risk-allocation framework yields
superior performance in complex environments, allowing multiple agents to find
collision-free paths within the user-specified $\Delta$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous navigation and collision avoidance for lightweight quadrotors without relying on heavy sensors or data-intensive methods.

Method: Proposes zero-shot rescaling strategies to transform relative depth estimates into metric depth using data from a visual-inertial navigation system, with evaluations in simulations and real-world deployment.

Result: Achieved 15 Hz on-board metric depth estimation using the best monotonic spline fitting approach, with successful integration into a motion planner for collision avoidance.

Conclusion: Lightweight and efficient metric depth estimation is feasible for autonomous flight using monocular RGB and IMU data.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to predict metric depth from monocular RGB
images and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). To enable collision avoidance
during autonomous flight, prior works either leverage heavy sensors (e.g.,
LiDARs or stereo cameras) or data-intensive and domain-specific fine-tuning of
monocular metric depth estimation methods. In contrast, we propose several
lightweight zero-shot rescaling strategies to obtain metric depth from relative
depth estimates via the sparse 3D feature map created using a visual-inertial
navigation system. These strategies are compared for their accuracy in diverse
simulation environments. The best performing approach, which leverages
monotonic spline fitting, is deployed in the real-world on a
compute-constrained quadrotor. We obtain on-board metric depth estimates at 15
Hz and demonstrate successful collision avoidance after integrating the
proposed method with a motion primitives-based planner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability issues and dependency on vast training datasets in multi-arm motion planning methods for complex tasks in shared spaces.

Method: The proposed approach trains two conditional diffusion models: the first generates single-arm trajectories, and the second resolves pairwise collision dynamics, integrated using a MAPF-inspired decomposition.

Result: DG-MAP demonstrates enhanced scalability and efficiency when applied to larger multi-arm systems compared to existing learning-based approaches.

Conclusion: DG-MAP scales effectively to larger multi-arm setups, making it a practical solution for planning in complex team sizes with reduced reliance on expansive datasets.

Abstract: Multi-arm motion planning is fundamental for enabling arms to complete
complex long-horizon tasks in shared spaces efficiently but current methods
struggle with scalability due to exponential state-space growth and reliance on
large training datasets for learned models. Inspired by Multi-Agent Path
Finding (MAPF), which decomposes planning into single-agent problems coupled
with collision resolution, we propose a novel diffusion-guided multi-arm
planner (DG-MAP) that enhances scalability of learning-based models while
reducing their reliance on massive multi-arm datasets. Recognizing that
collisions are primarily pairwise, we train two conditional diffusion models,
one to generate feasible single-arm trajectories, and a second, to model the
dual-arm dynamics required for effective pairwise collision resolution. By
integrating these specialized generative models within a MAPF-inspired
structured decomposition, our planner efficiently scales to larger number of
arms. Evaluations against alternative learning-based methods across various
team sizes demonstrate our method's effectiveness and practical applicability.

Result: The policy demonstrated an 86% success rate in simulations, outperforming baseline methods by 34%, and achieved collision-free performance across 20 real-world flights totaling 589 meters at speeds up to 4 m/s.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances quadrotor navigation around large obstacles, showing both high simulation success rates and robust real-world performance, demonstrating its practical viability.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based quadrotor navigation
method that leverages efficient differentiable simulation, novel loss
functions, and privileged information to navigate around large obstacles. Prior
learning-based methods perform well in scenes that exhibit narrow obstacles,
but struggle when the goal location is blocked by large walls or terrain. In
contrast, the proposed method utilizes time-of-arrival (ToA) maps as privileged
information and a yaw alignment loss to guide the robot around large obstacles.
The policy is evaluated in photo-realistic simulation environments containing
large obstacles, sharp corners, and dead-ends. Our approach achieves an 86%
success rate and outperforms baseline strategies by 34%. We deploy the policy
onboard a custom quadrotor in outdoor cluttered environments both during the

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This survey reviews about 100 papers employing RL for autonomous-driving within the CARLA simulator, categorizing methods, challenges, and evaluation benchmarks in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clarity over how RL algorithms are applied, benchmarked, and evaluated in autonomous driving research using CARLA.

Method: The authors surveyed peer-reviewed papers and categorized them by RL algorithm types, state/action/reward choices, and defined evaluation metrics within CARLA.

Result: Over 80% of studies use model-free RL methods; they detail state representation (e.g., RGB, LiDAR), control styles, reward shaping, evaluation metrics, and persistent challenges.

Conclusion: The paper provides taxonomy, statistics, unresolved challenges, and future directions, serving as both a reference and a roadmap for RL-based autonomous driving deployment.

Abstract: Autonomous-driving research has recently embraced deep Reinforcement Learning
(RL) as a promising framework for data-driven decision making, yet a clear
picture of how these algorithms are currently employed, benchmarked and
evaluated is still missing. This survey fills that gap by systematically
analysing around 100 peer-reviewed papers that train, test or validate RL
policies inside the open-source CARLA simulator. We first categorize the
literature by algorithmic family model-free, model-based, hierarchical, and
hybrid and quantify their prevalence, highlighting that more than 80% of
existing studies still rely on model-free methods such as DQN, PPO and SAC.
Next, we explain the diverse state, action and reward formulations adopted
across works, illustrating how choices of sensor modality (RGB, LiDAR, BEV,
semantic maps, and carla kinematics states), control abstraction (discrete vs.
continuous) and reward shaping are used across various literature. We also
consolidate the evaluation landscape by listing the most common metrics
(success rate, collision rate, lane deviation, driving score) and the towns,
scenarios and traffic configurations used in CARLA benchmarks. Persistent
challenges including sparse rewards, sim-to-real transfer, safety guarantees
and limited behaviour diversity are distilled into a set of open research
questions, and promising directions such as model-based RL, meta-learning and
richer multi-agent simulations are outlined. By providing a unified taxonomy,
quantitative statistics and a critical discussion of limitations, this review
aims to serve both as a reference for newcomers and as a roadmap for advancing
RL-based autonomous driving toward real-world deployment.

*Yoshiki Kanai,Akira Kanazawa,Hideyuki Ichiwara,Hiroshi Ito,Naoaki Noguchi,Tetsuya Ogata*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a simple bilateral teleoperation method using low-cost hardware without force sensors, ensuring effective force feedback for contact-rich manipulation. It is highly operable, stable, robust, and versatile, as demonstrated through experiments and numerical simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current teleoperation systems for contact tasks lack widespread adoption due to the complexity and difficulty in implementing bilateral systems with force feedback.

Method: The authors develop a bilateral teleoperation method that uses a simple feedback controller, eliminating the need for force sensors. It is designed for leader-follower setups and tested on affordable hardware. The method is robust at various communication cycle rates and doesn't require parameter adjustments when switching hardware.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated superior operability and contact stability compared to existing approaches. It also showed minimal performance degradation under low communication speeds and worked seamlessly on diverse low-cost hardware without parameter tuning.

Conclusion: The simplicity, robustness, and hardware versatility of this method can accelerate the adoption of force feedback teleoperation systems, advancing autonomy in contact-rich tasks and imitation learning.

Abstract: Effective data collection in contact-rich manipulation requires force
feedback during teleoperation, as accurate perception of contact is crucial for
stable control. However, such technology remains uncommon, largely because
bilateral teleoperation systems are complex and difficult to implement. To
overcome this, we propose a bilateral teleoperation method that relies only on
a simple feedback controller and does not require force sensors. The approach
is designed for leader-follower setups using low-cost hardware, making it
broadly applicable. Through numerical simulations and real-world experiments,
we demonstrate that the method requires minimal parameter tuning, yet achieves
both high operability and contact stability, outperforming conventional
approaches. Furthermore, we show its high robustness: even at low communication
cycle rates between leader and follower, control performance degradation is
minimal compared to high-speed operation. We also prove our method can be
implemented on two types of commercially available low-cost hardware with zero
parameter adjustments. This highlights its high ease of implementation and
versatility. We expect this method will expand the use of force feedback
teleoperation systems on low-cost hardware. This will contribute to advancing
contact-rich task autonomy in imitation learning.

Motivation: Existing event-based visual odometry struggles with reliability in field robots under low-light and HDR conditions. Leveraging deep neural networks can improve performance in these challenging environments.

Method: Stereo-DEVO integrates a static-stereo depth association strategy into a bundle adjustment framework, utilizes recurrent networks for optical flow estimation via voxel-based event representations, and combines these for real-time pose estimation.

Result: The system exhibits high precision pose estimation, processes VGA-resolution event data in real-time, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various datasets, showing robustness in nighttime HDR scenarios.

Conclusion: Stereo-DEVO expands the reliability and versatility of event-based visual odometry, and is particularly effective in handling motion blur and HDR conditions in real-world applications.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired sensors with pixels that independently
and asynchronously respond to brightness changes at microsecond resolution,
offering the potential to handle state estimation tasks involving motion blur
and high dynamic range (HDR) illumination conditions. However, the versatility
of event-based visual odometry (VO) relying on handcrafted data association
(either direct or indirect methods) is still unreliable, especially in field
robot applications under low-light HDR conditions, where the dynamic range can
be enormous and the signal-to-noise ratio is spatially-and-temporally varying.
Leveraging deep neural networks offers new possibilities for overcoming these
challenges. In this paper, we propose a learning-based stereo event visual
odometry. Building upon Deep Event Visual Odometry (DEVO), our system (called
Stereo-DEVO) introduces a novel and efficient static-stereo association
strategy for sparse depth estimation with almost no additional computational
burden. By integrating it into a tightly coupled bundle adjustment (BA)
optimization scheme, and benefiting from the recurrent network's ability to
perform accurate optical flow estimation through voxel-based event
representations to establish reliable patch associations, our system achieves
high-precision pose estimation in metric scale. In contrast to the offline
performance of DEVO, our system can process event data of \zs{Video Graphics
Array} (VGA) resolution in real time. Extensive evaluations on multiple public
real-world datasets and self-collected data justify our system's versatility,
demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art event-based VO
methods. More importantly, our system achieves stable pose estimation even in
large-scale nighttime HDR scenarios.

*Zixin Zhang,James Avtges,Todd D. Murphey*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recursive Koopman Learning (RKL), a new lightweight and sample-efficient method for real-time control updates using Koopman theory. It outperforms benchmarks with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most modern data-driven control methods require large datasets and struggle with real-time model updates, hindering their effectiveness in dynamic environments with limited computational resources.

Method: The authors propose Recursive Koopman Learning (RKL), a Koopman-based learning pipeline that achieves real-time updates, uses optimization-friendly formulations, and is independent of dataset size.

Result: RKL demonstrated significant improvements in sample efficiency and stability on a simulated two-link arm and a hybrid nonlinear hardware system with soft actuators, using less than 10% of the data required by benchmarks.

Conclusion: RKL is a sample-efficient, lightweight method for data-driven control, offering improved performance in real-time adaptive settings. The code is open-sourced for further research and application.

Abstract: Data-driven control methods need to be sample-efficient and lightweight,
especially when data acquisition and computational resources are limited --
such as during learning on hardware. Most modern data-driven methods require
large datasets and struggle with real-time updates of models, limiting their
performance in dynamic environments. Koopman theory formally represents
nonlinear systems as linear models over observables, and Koopman
representations can be determined from data in an optimization-friendly setting
with potentially rapid model updates. In this paper, we present a highly
sample-efficient, Koopman-based learning pipeline: Recursive Koopman Learning
(RKL). We identify sufficient conditions for model convergence and provide
formal algorithmic analysis supporting our claim that RKL is lightweight and
fast, with complexity independent of dataset size. We validate our method on a
simulated planar two-link arm and a hybrid nonlinear hardware system with soft
actuators, showing that real-time recursive Koopman model updates improve the
sample efficiency and stability of data-driven controller synthesis --
requiring only <10% of the data compared to benchmarks. The high-performance
C++ codebase is open-sourced. Website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses multi-agent exploration with behaviorally heterogeneous robots using SLAM, a game-theoretical task assignment scheme, and demonstrates benefits of heterogeneous teams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize exploration tasks in multi-agent robotic systems by leveraging the heterogeneity of behaviors to improve efficiency.

Method: Used a game-theoretical model by converting the task assignment problem into a non-cooperative game and implemented d-PBRAG for Nash equilibrium convergence, supplemented by SLAM and Behavioral Entropy evaluation.

Result: Demonstrated reduced communication costs and fast algorithmic convergence in simulations, with insights on sensing parameters and team heterogeneity affecting exploration efficiency.

Conclusion: Behavioral heterogeneity among robots positively impacts exploration efficiency, making it a beneficial strategy for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We study a problem of multi-agent exploration with behaviorally heterogeneous
robots. Each robot maps its surroundings using SLAM and identifies a set of
areas of interest (AoIs) or frontiers that are the most informative to explore
next. The robots assess the utility of going to a frontier using Behavioral
Entropy (BE) and then determine which frontier to go to via a distributed task
assignment scheme. We convert the task assignment problem into a
non-cooperative game and use a distributed algorithm (d-PBRAG) to converge to
the Nash equilibrium (which we show is the optimal task allocation solution).
For unknown utility cases, we provide robust bounds using approximate rewards.
We test our algorithm (which has less communication cost and fast convergence)
in simulation, where we explore the effect of sensing radii, sensing accuracy,
and heterogeneity among robotic teams with respect to the time taken to
complete exploration and path traveled. We observe that having a team of agents
with heterogeneous behaviors is beneficial.

*Yongkai Tian,Yirong Qi,Xin Yu,Wenjun Wu,Jie Luo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses inefficiencies in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning (MIRL) by incorporating symmetry into existing algorithms, improving sample efficiency and achieving accurate reward recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to resolve the inefficiency and high cost of expert demonstrations required by IRL, particularly for multi-robot systems, by leveraging symmetry to enhance MIRL methods.

Method: A universal framework is proposed to incorporate symmetry into multi-agent adversarial IRL algorithms, improving the efficiency and accuracy of inferred reward functions.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved sample efficiency and accuracy in MIRL across various challenging tasks and was successfully validated in real-world multi-robot systems.

Conclusion: Leveraging system symmetry is a practical and effective approach to improving sample efficiency in multi-agent IRL, with real-world applicability demonstrated.

Abstract: In robotic systems, the performance of reinforcement learning depends on the
rationality of predefined reward functions. However, manually designed reward
functions often lead to policy failures due to inaccuracies. Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) addresses this problem by inferring implicit
reward functions from expert demonstrations. Nevertheless, existing methods
rely heavily on large amounts of expert demonstrations to accurately recover
the reward function. The high cost of collecting expert demonstrations in
robotic applications, particularly in multi-robot systems, severely hinders the
practical deployment of IRL. Consequently, improving sample efficiency has
emerged as a critical challenge in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning
(MIRL). Inspired by the symmetry inherent in multi-agent systems, this work
theoretically demonstrates that leveraging symmetry enables the recovery of
more accurate reward functions. Building upon this insight, we propose a
universal framework that integrates symmetry into existing multi-agent
adversarial IRL algorithms, thereby significantly enhancing sample efficiency.
Experimental results from multiple challenging tasks have demonstrated the
effectiveness of this framework. Further validation in physical multi-robot
systems has shown the practicality of our method.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised learning method to improve visual-based localization by enhancing deep feature extraction and tracking in challenging environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual-based localization suffers performance drops in large-scale, outdoor, and long-term conditions due to issues like lighting changes, dynamic scenes, and low-texture areas.

Method: The approach involves using self-supervised learning with task-specific feedback to enhance the stability and informativeness of features.

Result: The method promotes feature robustness and generalization, leading to better performance in challenging environments.

Conclusion: Enhancing feature extraction and tracking via self-supervised learning improves the reliability and adaptability of visual-based localization.

Abstract: Visual-based localization has made significant progress, yet its performance
often drops in large-scale, outdoor, and long-term settings due to factors like
lighting changes, dynamic scenes, and low-texture areas. These challenges
degrade feature extraction and tracking, which are critical for accurate motion
estimation. While learning-based methods such as SuperPoint and SuperGlue show
improved feature coverage and robustness, they still face generalization issues
with out-of-distribution data. We address this by enhancing deep feature
extraction and tracking through self-supervised learning with task specific
feedback. Our method promotes stable and informative features, improving
generalization and reliability in challenging environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a glove-mediated tactile-kinematic framework for transferring human grasping skills to robotic hands through imitation learning, validated in various grasp scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in mapping tactile and kinesthetic sensory feedback to motor actions for robotic hands, enabling them to mimic human dexterous manipulation skills.

Method: Integration of tactile and kinesthetic data collection with a data glove usable by both humans and robots, graph-based multimodal data representation, and the use of Tactile-Kinesthetic Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (TK-STGN) for prediction and mapping.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated its effectiveness in generalized grasping tasks, including handling deformable objects, by capturing and transferring human-natural hand operation to robots.

Conclusion: This glove-mediated approach successfully addresses challenges in robotic grasping by emphasizing human-like tactile-kinesthetic perception and enabling reliable skill transfer to robotic hands.

Abstract: Tactile and kinesthetic perceptions are crucial for human dexterous
manipulation, enabling reliable grasping of objects via proprioceptive
sensorimotor integration. For robotic hands, even though acquiring such tactile
and kinesthetic feedback is feasible, establishing a direct mapping from this
sensory feedback to motor actions remains challenging. In this paper, we
propose a novel glove-mediated tactile-kinematic perception-prediction
framework for grasp skill transfer from human intuitive and natural operation
to robotic execution based on imitation learning, and its effectiveness is
validated through generalized grasping tasks, including those involving
deformable objects. Firstly, we integrate a data glove to capture tactile and
kinesthetic data at the joint level. The glove is adaptable for both human and
robotic hands, allowing data collection from natural human hand demonstrations
across different scenarios. It ensures consistency in the raw data format,
enabling evaluation of grasping for both human and robotic hands. Secondly, we
establish a unified representation of multi-modal inputs based on graph
structures with polar coordinates. We explicitly integrate the morphological
differences into the designed representation, enhancing the compatibility
across different demonstrators and robotic hands. Furthermore, we introduce the
Tactile-Kinesthetic Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (TK-STGN), which leverage
multidimensional subgraph convolutions and attention-based LSTM layers to
extract spatio-temporal features from graph inputs to predict node-based states
for each hand joint. These predictions are then mapped to final commands
through a force-position hybrid mapping.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PegasusFlow introduces a hierarchical framework for robot trajectory planning, skipping the dependency on expert demonstrations and achieving high efficiency through novel sampling algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and impracticalities in robot trajectory planning caused by reliance on expert demonstrations for specialized robots with scarce data.

Method: PegasusFlow employs a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework using Weighted Basis Function Optimization (WBFO), leveraging spline basis representations and scalable asynchronous parallel simulations.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in trajectory optimization and robotic navigation tasks, achieving 100% success rate and being 18% faster in complex tasks like barrier-crossing.

Conclusion: PegasusFlow validates its effectiveness, enabling efficient and superior trajectory planning for robots navigating complex terrains.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer powerful generative capabilities for robot trajectory
planning, yet their practical deployment on robots is hindered by a critical
bottleneck: a reliance on imitation learning from expert demonstrations. This
paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and
creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome
this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that
enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from
environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our
core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function
Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve
superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional
methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous
parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for
efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and
robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly
Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start,
significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task,
our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best
method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel neural network-based force control strategy for robotic manipulators that improves force tracking capabilities. It incorporates tangential velocity and shows superior performance in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional interaction controllers for robotics often require extensive tuning or expert knowledge, making them impractical for real-world applications. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: An ensemble of feedforward neural networks predicts contact forces, which are used to optimize the control action. The residual action is added to the direct force controller's output for application in an impedance controller.

Result: The proposed Velocity-augmented Artificial intelligence Interaction Controller for Ambiguous Models (VAICAM) was tested in simulation on a Franka Emika Panda robot, achieving better force-tracking performance than baseline controllers across various trajectories.

Conclusion: VAICAM demonstrates the effectiveness of combining neural networks with traditional controllers to enhance robotic interaction control, particularly improving handling of tangential velocities during rapid motions.

Abstract: As robotics gains popularity, interaction control becomes crucial for
ensuring force tracking in manipulator-based tasks. Typically, traditional
interaction controllers either require extensive tuning, or demand expert
knowledge of the environment, which is often impractical in real-world
applications. This work proposes a novel control strategy leveraging Neural
Networks (NNs) to enhance the force-tracking behavior of a Direct Force
Controller (DFC). Unlike similar previous approaches, it accounts for the
manipulator's tangential velocity, a critical factor in force exertion,
especially during fast motions. The method employs an ensemble of feedforward
NNs to predict contact forces, then exploits the prediction to solve an
optimization problem and generate an optimal residual action, which is added to
the DFC output and applied to an impedance controller. The proposed
Velocity-augmented Artificial intelligence Interaction Controller for Ambiguous
Models (VAICAM) is validated in the Gazebo simulator on a Franka Emika Panda
robot. Against a vast set of trajectories, VAICAM achieves superior performance
compared to two baseline controllers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical hybrid framework for autonomous robotic systems to safely and efficiently guide adversarial agents away from protected areas using reach-avoid game theory and local motion planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in robotics present new opportunities but also significant security challenges, particularly in urban obstacle-rich environments, requiring innovative herding strategies against adversarial agents.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical hybrid framework integrating reach-avoid game theory, local motion planning, virtual containment boundaries, and event-triggered pursuit for scalable multi-agent coordination.

Result: The simulation results show that the approach enables safe and efficient navigation, guiding adversarial agents into predetermined safe regions while avoiding collisions in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the herding problem in complex environments and offers robust solutions for handling adversarial agents with adaptive behaviors.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics have enabled the widespread deployment of
autonomous robotic systems in complex operational environments, presenting both
unprecedented opportunities and significant security problems. Traditional
shepherding approaches based on fixed formations are often ineffective or risky
in urban and obstacle-rich scenarios, especially when facing adversarial agents
with unknown and adaptive behaviors. This paper addresses this challenge as an
extended herding problem, where defensive robotic systems must safely guide
adversarial agents with unknown strategies away from protected areas and into
predetermined safe regions, while maintaining collision-free navigation in
dynamic environments. We propose a hierarchical hybrid framework based on
reach-avoid game theory and local motion planning, incorporating a virtual
containment boundary and event-triggered pursuit mechanisms to enable scalable
and robust multi-agent coordination. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves safe and efficient guidance of adversarial agents to
designated regions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLAP, a robust localization method for robots, which helped a team win the RoboCup 2024 soccer competition by handling challenging real-world conditions and outperforming other methods under high noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to create a robust and accurate localization algorithm for autonomous humanoid robots in a challenging soccer competition environment, where traditional methods were prone to failure under real-world constraints such as dynamic occlusions and sensor noise.

Method: CLAP clusters estimated states derived from pairs of field features to localize a robot's position and orientation. It filters out incorrect estimates by leveraging their dispersal patterns, combining this with particle filters and an extended Kalman filter for improved consistency and smoothness.

Result: CLAP achieved similar accuracy to other methods but outperformed them in robustness when dealing with high rates of false positive feature detection. It showed improved stability with reduced velocity jumps in experiments.

Conclusion: The successful application of CLAP demonstrated its capability to sustain high performance in real-world conditions, as evidenced by its pivotal role in the competition, enabling precise actions like long-range shooting and goal defense.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our localization method called CLAP, Clustering to
Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which helped us win the RoboCup 2024
adult-sized autonomous humanoid soccer competition. Competition rules limited
our sensor suite to stereo vision and an inertial sensor, similar to humans. In
addition, our robot had to deal with varying lighting conditions, dynamic
feature occlusions, noise from high-impact stepping, and mistaken features from
bystanders and neighboring fields. Therefore, we needed an accurate, and most
importantly robust localization algorithm that would be the foundation for our
path-planning and game-strategy algorithms. CLAP achieves these requirements by
clustering estimated states of our robot from pairs of field features to
localize its global position and orientation. Correct state estimates naturally
cluster together, while incorrect estimates spread apart, making CLAP resilient
to noise and incorrect inputs. CLAP is paired with a particle filter and an
extended Kalman filter to improve consistency and smoothness. Tests of CLAP
with other landmark-based localization methods showed similar accuracy.
However, tests with increased false positive feature detection showed that CLAP
outperformed other methods in terms of robustness with very little divergence
and velocity jumps. Our localization performed well in competition, allowing
our robot to shoot faraway goals and narrowly defend our goal.

Motivation: To address the gap between lab-developed assistive robots and their viability in real-world contexts for aiding older individuals with frailty.

Method: Conducted co-design workshops with 61 participants, including frail individuals, carers, and healthcare professionals, incorporating a persona-based approach to understand psychosocial and environmental factors.

Result: The study identified emotional, social, and psychological issues affecting assistive technology use and presented design requirements tailored to frailty needs.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical insights to guide the design and development of assistive robots that better meet real-world needs, making them more viable for use.

Abstract: While assistive robots have much potential to help older people with
frailty-related needs, there are few in use. There is a gap between what is
developed in laboratories and what would be viable in real-world contexts.
Through a series of co-design workshops (61 participants across 7 sessions)
including those with lived experience of frailty, their carers, and healthcare
professionals, we gained a deeper understanding of everyday issues concerning
the place of new technologies in their lives. A persona-based approach surfaced
emotional, social, and psychological issues. Any assistive solution must be
developed in the context of this complex interplay of psychosocial and
environmental factors. Our findings, presented as design requirements in direct
relation to frailty, can help promote design thinking that addresses people's
needs in a more pragmatic way to move assistive robotics closer to real-world

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Extended Fast Marching Tree algorithm (FMT$^{x}$) enables efficient path replanning in dynamic environments, combining real-time adaptation with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of single-pass FMT$^{*}$ and the high computational cost of full replanning in dynamic scenarios affecting real-time robotic navigation.

Method: FMT$^{x}$ revises neighbor selection and employs a cost-ordered priority queue with a focused update condition to repair suboptimal paths caused by environmental changes.

Result: FMT$^{x}$ ensures efficient, asymptotically optimal replanning, outperforming competitors like RRT$^{x}$ in reacting to dynamic changes with reduced computational load.

Conclusion: FMT$^{x}$ offers a promising solution for real-time path planning, maintaining computational efficiency and robust adaptation in dynamic, unpredictable environments.

Abstract: Path planning in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in robotics,
especially as autonomous systems are deployed in unpredictable spaces such as
warehouses and public roads. While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree
(FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their
single-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time
adaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally
expensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching
Tree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic
environments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and
demonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation,
enabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better
connections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational
efficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a
selective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and
trigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path,
FMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the
environment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency
of FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle
configuration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal
solution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that
FMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more
swiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a
more effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable
worlds.

Abstract: This paper presents RoboMatch, a novel unified teleoperation platform for
mobile manipulation with an auto-matching network architecture, designed to
tackle long-horizon tasks in dynamic environments. Our system enhances
teleoperation performance, data collection efficiency, task accuracy, and
operational stability. The core of RoboMatch is a cockpit-style control
interface that enables synchronous operation of the mobile base and dual arms,
significantly improving control precision and data collection. Moreover, we
introduce the Proprioceptive-Visual Enhanced Diffusion Policy (PVE-DP), which
leverages Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for multi-scale visual feature
extraction and integrates high-precision IMUs at the end-effector to enrich
proprioceptive feedback, substantially boosting fine manipulation performance.
Furthermore, we propose an Auto-Matching Network (AMN) architecture that
decomposes long-horizon tasks into logical sequences and dynamically assigns
lightweight pre-trained models for distributed inference. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach improves data collection efficiency by over 20%,
increases task success rates by 20-30% with PVE-DP, and enhances long-horizon
inference performance by approximately 40% with AMN, offering a robust solution
for complex manipulation tasks.

*Rebecca Martin,Jay Patrikar,Sebastian Scherer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using LLM-Agents for automating the generation of test cases to audit machine learning models and identify their failure modes, particularly by projecting high-dimensional input spaces into low-dimensional text-embedding manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of machine learning models in high-risk scenarios necessitates a way to ensure their reliability and safety through efficient audits, which is difficult given the complexity of input spaces and reliance on human resources.

Method: The method involves deploying LLM-Agents as orchestrators to generate semantically relevant test cases, guiding the discovery of failure distributions in black-box machine learning models by leveraging tools and mapping inputs into a reduced-dimensional text-embedding space.

Result: The framework is demonstrated using two applications: models trained on the MNIST dataset with missing digits and vision-based intruder detection tasks for aerial vehicles in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The LLM-Agent centric framework shows promise in autonomously identifying operational limitations in machine learning models, improving both safety testing and compliance assessments.

Abstract: Specialized machine learning models, regardless of architecture and training,
are susceptible to failures in deployment. With their increasing use in high
risk situations, the ability to audit these models by determining their
operational design domain (ODD) is crucial in ensuring safety and compliance.
However, given the high-dimensional input spaces, this process often requires
significant human resources and domain expertise. To alleviate this, we
introduce \coolname, an LLM-Agent centric framework for automated generation of
semantically relevant test cases to search for failure modes in specialized
black-box models. By leveraging LLM-Agents as tool orchestrators, we aim to fit
a uncertainty-aware failure distribution model on a learned text-embedding
manifold by projecting the high-dimension input space to low-dimension
text-embedding latent space. The LLM-Agent is tasked with iteratively building
the failure landscape by leveraging tools for generating test-cases to probe
the model-under-test (MUT) and recording the response. The agent also guides
the search using tools to probe uncertainty estimate on the low dimensional
manifold. We demonstrate this process in a simple case using models trained
with missing digits on the MNIST dataset and in the real world setting of
vision-based intruder detection for aerial vehicles.

*Stefan Podgorski,Sourav Garg,Mehdi Hosseinzadeh,Lachlan Mares,Feras Dayoub,Ian Reid*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an RGB-only topometric navigation system for robots, enabling zero-shot, long-horizon navigation without 3D maps or pre-trained controllers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual navigation methods face challenges like high computational demands and poor generalizability across diverse environments.

Method: The system combines global topological planning with local metric trajectory control, leveraging monocular depth, traversability estimation, and a fallback mechanism for adaptability.

Result: The proposed framework is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods in simulated and real-world tests, proving its robustness and deployability.

Conclusion: The novel approach improves adaptability and deployability in visual navigation, offering an effective solution for open-set environments without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D
maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and
difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a
novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables
zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or
pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path
planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate
towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key
limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory
using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an
auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when
necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set
applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world
tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective
solution for visual navigation in open-set environments. The source code is

### [218] [Parallel, Asymptotically Optimal Algorithms for Moving Target Traveling Salesman Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08743)
*Anoop Bhat,Geordan Gutow,Bhaskar Vundurthy,Zhongqiang Ren,Sivakumar Rathinam,Howie Choset*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Moving Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MT-TSP) by proposing a framework called Iterated Random Generalized (IRG) TSP, which ensures convergence to an optimal solution for intercepting moving targets with time and spatial constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of intercepting moving targets within defined time windows has no existing algorithm guaranteeing convergence to an optimal solution, especially in cases involving nonlinear trajectories or agent kinematic constraints.

Method: The authors propose the IRG TSP framework, which alternates between sampling interception points and solving a generalized TSP (GTSP). Two parallel algorithms, IRG-PGLNS and PCG, are introduced for solving GTSPs efficiently.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate faster convergence for the proposed methods compared to a baseline. The algorithms were tested on three MT-TSP variants: spatial distance interception, Dubins car agent, and redundant robot arm agent.

Conclusion: The proposed IRG framework, with its parallelized algorithms, offers a reliable and faster solution to MT-TSP compared to existing methods, proving its effectiveness in handling complex variants of the problem.

Abstract: The Moving Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MT-TSP) seeks an agent
trajectory that intercepts several moving targets, within a particular time
window for each target. In the presence of generic nonlinear target
trajectories or kinematic constraints on the agent, no prior algorithm
guarantees convergence to an optimal MT-TSP solution. Therefore, we introduce
the Iterated Random Generalized (IRG) TSP framework. The key idea behind IRG is
to alternate between randomly sampling a set of agent configuration-time
points, corresponding to interceptions of targets, and finding a sequence of
interception points by solving a generalized TSP (GTSP). This alternation
enables asymptotic convergence to the optimum. We introduce two parallel
algorithms within the IRG framework. The first algorithm, IRG-PGLNS, solves
GTSPs using PGLNS, our parallelized extension of the state-of-the-art solver
GLNS. The second algorithm, Parallel Communicating GTSPs (PCG), solves GTSPs
corresponding to several sets of points simultaneously. We present numerical
results for three variants of the MT-TSP: one where intercepting a target only
requires coming within a particular distance, another where the agent is a
variable-speed Dubins car, and a third where the agent is a redundant robot
arm. We show that IRG-PGLNS and PCG both converge faster than a baseline based
on prior work.

### [219] [SocialNav-SUB: Benchmarking VLMs for Scene Understanding in Social Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08757)
*Michael J. Munje,Chen Tang,Shuijing Liu,Zichao Hu,Yifeng Zhu,Jiaxun Cui,Garrett Warnell,Joydeep Biswas,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces SocialNav-SUB, a benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in social robot navigation tasks. It highlights current gaps in VLMs' understanding of social navigation scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in accurately understanding complex social navigation scenes, which are vital for safe robot navigation in human-centered environments.

Method: The authors develop a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark called SocialNav-SUB to systematically evaluate VLMs on spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning tasks in robot navigation scenarios.

Result: Experiments reveal that while the top-performing VLM shows progress, it underperforms compared to rule-based methods and human consensus, exposing gaps in social scene understanding.

Conclusion: SocialNav-SUB provides a foundation for evaluating and improving VLMs, driving future research to better tailor these models for effective social robot navigation.

Abstract: Robot navigation in dynamic, human-centered environments requires
socially-compliant decisions grounded in robust scene understanding. Recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object
recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities
that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,
it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social
navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents
and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot
navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social
robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to
meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social
Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question
Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene
understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB
provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based
baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social
reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art
VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging
probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler
rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in
social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for
further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a
framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot
navigation needs. An overview of this paper along with the code and data can be

### [220] [Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion for Planning with Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08775)
*Wonsuhk Jung,Utkarsh A. Mishra,Nadun Ranawaka Arachchige,Yongxin Chen,Danfei Xu,Shreyas Kousik*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces JM2D, a model integration framework for combining model-free diffusion planners with model-based optimization modules, addressing compatibility challenges without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively combine model-free diffusion planners with model-based optimization in robotic systems to ensure safety and task performance.

Method: The paper proposes JM2D, which formulates integration as a joint sampling problem using an interaction potential, leveraging importance sampling to handle non-differentiable, non-convex objectives.

Result: JM2D improves the performance of diffusion planners while maintaining safety across offline reinforcement learning and robot manipulation tasks, surpassing conventional safety filters.

Conclusion: JM2D unifies module integration and offers improved generative modeling, ensuring better compatibility and performance in complex robotic systems.

Abstract: Model-free diffusion planners have shown great promise for robot motion
planning, but practical robotic systems often require combining them with
model-based optimization modules to enforce constraints, such as safety.
Naively integrating these modules presents compatibility challenges when
diffusion's multi-modal outputs behave adversarially to optimization-based
modules. To address this, we introduce Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion
(JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework. JM2D formulates module
integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility via an
interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling,
JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction
potential, thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from
non-convex optimization modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning
diffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation.
JM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety
filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional
generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by
comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

### [221] [Calib3R: A 3D Foundation Model for Multi-Camera to Robot Calibration and 3D Metric-Scaled Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08813)
*Davide Allegro,Matteo Terreran,Stefano Ghidoni*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Calib3R introduces a unified method for camera-to-robot calibration and metric-scaled 3D reconstruction without using patterns, designed to simplify multi-camera setups and utilize RGB image data effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often rely on RGB data for critical tasks, but require accurate 3D scene representations linked to their reference frame. Existing methods separate the calibration and reconstruction processes, which introduces inefficiency and complexity.

Method: The paper proposes Calib3R, a unified optimization framework leveraging the MASt3R foundation model. It jointly extracts 3D pointmaps from RGB images and integrates these with robot poses to achieve scaled 3D scene reconstruction aligned with the robot.

Result: Calib3R achieves high calibration accuracy using fewer than 10 images, outperforming traditional marker-based and target-less methods across both single- and multi-camera setups.

Conclusion: Calib3R simplifies the process of obtaining scaled and aligned 3D scene representations, making it feasible for robotic systems to achieve reliable visual-based interaction while reducing calibration complexity.

Abstract: Robots often rely on RGB images for tasks like manipulation and navigation.
However, reliable interaction typically requires a 3D scene representation that
is metric-scaled and aligned with the robot reference frame. This depends on
accurate camera-to-robot calibration and dense 3D reconstruction, tasks usually
treated separately, despite both relying on geometric correspondences from RGB
data. Traditional calibration needs patterns, while RGB-based reconstruction
yields geometry with an unknown scale in an arbitrary frame. Multi-camera
setups add further complexity, as data must be expressed in a shared reference
frame. We present Calib3R, a patternless method that jointly performs
camera-to-robot calibration and metric-scaled 3D reconstruction via unified
optimization. Calib3R handles single- and multi-camera setups on robot arms or
mobile robots. It builds on the 3D foundation model MASt3R to extract pointmaps
from RGB images, which are combined with robot poses to reconstruct a scaled 3D
scene aligned with the robot. Experiments on diverse datasets show that Calib3R
achieves accurate calibration with less than 10 images, outperforming
target-less and marker-based methods.

### [222] [RoboChemist: Long-Horizon and Safety-Compliant Robotic Chemical Experimentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08820)
*Zongzheng Zhang,Chenghao Yue,Haobo Xu,Minwen Liao,Xianglin Qi,Huan-ang Gao,Ziwei Wang,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoboChemist, a robotic framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to perform complex chemical experiments, achieving higher success and compliance rates compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of robotic chemists that struggle with handling hazardous substances, complex tasks, and adherence to experimental norms, while aiming to liberate human experts from repetitive tasks and accelerate scientific discovery.

Method: The method uses a dual-loop framework where VLMs serve as planners, visual prompt generators, and monitors, combined with a VLA interface that accepts visual prompts for precise action control.

Result: The system outperformed state-of-the-art in terms of success rate (23.57% improvement) and compliance rate (0.298 average increase), demonstrating generalization to new objects and tasks.

Conclusion: RoboChemist offers a robust solution for automating complex chemical experiments with higher efficiency, compliance, and adaptability, marking a significant advancement in robotic chemistry.

Abstract: Robotic chemists promise to both liberate human experts from repetitive tasks
and accelerate scientific discovery, yet remain in their infancy. Chemical
experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable
substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict
compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose
\textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based
systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with
transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack
semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve
as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt
generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and
regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts
image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned
control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete
multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate
and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA
baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.

TL;DR: The paper investigates developers' interactions with ChatGPT for refactoring tasks using text mining and analysis of prompts and responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited understanding of how developers communicate refactoring needs to ChatGPT.

Method: Text mining of 715 refactoring-related interactions extracted from a dataset of 29,778 ChatGPT prompts and responses.

Result: Findings shed light on developers' explicit refactoring intentions and ChatGPT’s responses to their needs.

Conclusion: The study helps clarify communication patterns and effectiveness of ChatGPT in refactoring-related interactions, contributing to improved developer-tool collaboration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have become widely popular and
widely used in various software engineering tasks such as refactoring, testing,
code review, and program comprehension. Although recent studies have examined
the effectiveness of LLMs in recommending and suggesting refactoring, there is
a limited understanding of how developers express their refactoring needs when
interacting with ChatGPT. In this paper, our goal is to explore interactions
related to refactoring between developers and ChatGPT to better understand how
developers identify areas for improvement in code, and how ChatGPT addresses
developers' needs. Our approach involves text mining 715 refactoring-related
interactions from 29,778 ChatGPT prompts and responses, as well as the analysis
of developers' explicit refactoring intentions.

*Carmen Cârlan,Daniel Ratiu,Michael Wagner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes bridging the gap between software development and safety engineering by advocating for 'safety factories,' which integrate safety tools and methods into development pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern cyber-physical systems rely on complex, safety-critical software that requires rapid iterations to meet user demands, creating a need to harmonize software development and safety engineering.

Method: The paper proposes incorporating safety work into development pipelines by creating semantically rich, machine-processable safety models, automating consistency checks, and generating safety documentation.

Result: While direct results are not detailed, the paper highlights the potential of applying software engineering best practices to enhance safety engineering processes.

Conclusion: Integrating safety tools and methods with software development practices through 'safety factories' can elevate the rigor, automation, and collaboration in safety-critical systems development.

Abstract: Modern cyber-physical systems are operated by complex software that
increasingly takes over safety-critical functions. Software enables rapid
iterations and continuous delivery of new functionality that meets the
ever-changing expectations of users. As high-speed development requires
discipline, rigor, and automation, software factories are used. These entail
methods and tools used for software development, such as build systems and
pipelines. To keep up with the rapid evolution of software, we need to bridge
the disconnect in methods and tools between software development and safety
engineering today. We need to invest more in formality upfront - capturing
safety work products in semantically rich models that are machine-processable,
defining automatic consistency checks, and automating the generation of
documentation - to benefit later. Transferring best practices from software to
safety engineering is worth exploring. We advocate for safety factories, which
integrate safety tooling and methods into software development pipelines.

*Marco Torchiano,Riccardo Coppola,Antonio Vetro',Xhoi Musaj*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study examines gender and nationality diversity in student teams within an agile software development course and finds that gender diversity moderately benefits project success, while nationality diversity has a negligible negative effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the impact of team diversity, focusing on gender and nationality, on team outcomes in an educational agile software development setting.

Method: The analysis included 51 student teams over three years, measuring diversity using indexes for gender, nationality, and their overlap, with statistical methods to correlate diversity with project success.

Result: Gender diversity moderately correlates with improved project outcomes; nationality diversity shows a negligible negative effect, and combined diversity (gender and nationality) has a slight negative impact, possibly due to communication barriers and cultural differences.

Conclusion: Promoting diversity in educational teams, particularly gender diversity, generally benefits performance and aligns with inclusivity goals without compromising educational success.

Abstract: Software Engineering is mostly a male-dominated sector, where gender
diversity is a key feature for improving equality of opportunities,
productivity, and innovation. Other diversity aspects, including but not
limited to nationality and ethnicity, are often understudied.In this work we
aim to assess the impact of team diversity, focusing mainly on gender and
nationality, in the context of an agile software development project-based
course. We analyzed 51 teams over three academic years, measuring three
different Diversity indexes - regarding Gender, Nationality and their
co-presence - to examine how different aspects of diversity impact the quality
of team project outcomes.Statistical analysis revealed a moderate,
statistically significant correlation between gender diversity and project
success, aligning with existing literature. Diversity in nationality showed a
negative but negligible effect on project results, indicating that promoting
these aspects does not harm students' performance. Analyzing their co-presence
within a team, gender and nationality combined had a negative impact, likely
due to increased communication barriers and differing cultural norms.This study
underscores the importance of considering multiple diversity dimensions and
their interactions in educational settings. Our findings, overall, show that
promoting diversity in teams does not negatively impact their performance and
achievement of educational goals.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents AutoStub, a method that uses Genetic Programming to generate symbolic stubs for external functions, achieving over 90% accuracy for 55% of evaluated functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of symbolic execution struggling with external functions (e.g., native methods), which often require manual intervention, extra context, or costly SMT solver usage to approximate behavior.

Method: It uses Genetic Programming: external functions are executed on random inputs to collect output data, which is then used to derive approximating expressions as symbolic stubs during symbolic execution.

Result: AutoStub achieves over 90% accuracy for 55% of functions evaluated, demonstrating its utility in bringing efficiency and uncovering edge cases during software testing.

Conclusion: The proposed AutoStub method significantly enhances symbolic execution by automating the generation of stubs for external functions, reducing manual involvement and improving path exploration in software testing.

Abstract: Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software testing, but suffers
from limitations when encountering external functions, such as native methods
or third-party libraries. Existing solutions often require additional context,
expensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions
through symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic
execution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor
encounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing
the function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic
Programming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the
function, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow
the symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention,
enabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We
demonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with
over 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer
language-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software
testing.

Abstract: The lack of a macro-level, systematic evaluation theory to guide the
implementation of evaluation practices has become a key bottleneck in the
reform of global research evaluation systems. By reviewing the historical
development of research evaluation, this paper highlights the current binary
opposition between qualitative and quantitative methods in evaluation
practices. This paper introduces the System of All-round Evaluation of Research
(SAER), a framework that integrates form, content, and utility evaluations with

binary, providing a comprehensive foundation for global evaluation reforms. The
comprehensive system proposes a trinity of three evaluation dimensions,
combined with six evaluation elements, which would help academic evaluators and

*Amirali Rayegan,Tim Menzies*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Introducing EZR, an efficient multi-objective optimization framework utilizing active sampling and decision trees to reduce labeling while enhancing clarity in software engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization challenges in software engineering often involve large configuration spaces and error-prone labeling, necessitating efficient methods.

Method: The EZR framework uses an active learning approach with Naive Bayes sampling to identify configurations, then builds decision trees for clear explanations.

Result: EZR achieves over 90% of the best-known optimization performance across 60 datasets, outperforming standard explainable AI methods in clarity.

Conclusion: Using fewer but more informative examples is effective for label-efficient optimization and explanatory models in software systems.

Abstract: Efficient, interpretable optimization is a critical but underexplored
challenge in software engineering, where practitioners routinely face vast
configuration spaces and costly, error-prone labeling processes. This paper
introduces EZR, a novel and modular framework for multi-objective optimization
that unifies active sampling, learning, and explanation within a single,
lightweight pipeline. Departing from conventional wisdom, our Maximum Clarity
Heuristic demonstrates that using less (but more informative) data can yield
optimization models that are both effective and deeply understandable. EZR
employs an active learning strategy based on Naive Bayes sampling to
efficiently identify high-quality configurations with a fraction of the labels
required by fully supervised approaches. It then distills optimization logic
into concise decision trees, offering transparent, actionable explanations for
both global and local decision-making. Extensive experiments across 60
real-world datasets establish that EZR reliably achieves over 90% of the
best-known optimization performance in most cases, while providing clear,
cohort-based rationales that surpass standard attribution-based explainable AI
(XAI) methods (LIME, SHAP, BreakDown) in clarity and utility. These results
endorse "less but better"; it is both possible and often preferable to use
fewer (but more informative) examples to generate label-efficient optimization
and explanations in software systems. To support transparency and

TL;DR: This paper introduces SWE-Mirror, a pipeline to create large-scale training datasets for issue-resolving tasks by mirroring real-world issues into configurable Gym environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating scalable and verifiable training datasets is challenging, with current methods having low success rates and inefficiencies. Real-world human-reported issues remain an untapped resource.

Method: The SWE-Mirror pipeline mirrors and reanimates real-world issues into configurable Gym environments by leveraging issue-resolving history from GitHub.

Result: The application of SWE-Mirror yielded a dataset of 60,671 tasks, improving the performance of coding agents significantly. Extending the dataset further established new SOTA on the OpenHands framework for LLMs.

Conclusion: SWE-Mirror enables efficient reuse of real-world issues for constructing large-scale datasets, enhancing issue-resolving performance in language models, and proving the effectiveness of its approach.

Abstract: Creating large-scale verifiable training datasets for issue-resolving tasks
is a critical yet notoriously difficult challenge. Existing methods on
automating the Gym environment setup process for real-world issues suffer from
low success rates and high overhead. Meanwhile, synthesizing new tasks within
existing Gym environments leaves the vast pool of authentic, human-reported
problems untapped. To maximize the utilization of existing Gym environments and
also the rich data of issue-resolving history on GitHub, we introduce
SWE-Mirror, a pipeline that distills a real-world issue's semantic essence,
mirrors it into another repository with a configured Gym environment, and
re-animates it as a verifiable issue-resolving task. SWE-Mirror reuses existing
Gym environments along with the vast pool of issue-resolving history hosted on
GitHub to construct a large-scale dataset of mirrored authentic and verifiable
tasks. Applying SWE-Mirror to 40 repositories across 4 languages, we have
curated a dataset with 60,671 issue-resolving tasks and demonstrated the value
of our dataset by training and evaluating coding agents at various scale.
Post-training experiments show that models trained with the dataset exhibit
improvements in issue-resolving capabilities. Furthermore, by extending the
dataset size to over 12,000 high-quality trajectories, we established a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct based LLMs on the
OpenHands agent framework, which increases the resolve rate on
SWE-Bench-Verified by +21.8% for the 7B model and +46.0% for the 32B model and
validates the effectiveness of our approach.

### [230] [Handling Open-Vocabulary Constructs in Formalizing Specifications: Retrieval-Augmented Parsing with Expert Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08808)
*Mohammad Saqib Hasan,Sayontan Ghosh,Dhruv Verma,Geoff Kuenning,Erez Zadok,Scott A. Smolka,Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of handling Open-Vocabulary Constructs (OVCs) in converting natural language to formal languages by proposing a dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing (DKAP) framework, enhanced with a retrieval-augmented parsing approach called ROLex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the poor performance of models when dealing with OVCs due to their lack of prior knowledge and to devise a method for dynamically incorporating expert-provided constructs during inference without retraining the model.

Method: The authors propose DKAP, where a model is augmented with a growing key-value lexicon containing expert-provided knowledge. They introduce ROLex, which combines a retriever and a generator to utilize this lexicon effectively. Synthetic data generation and augmentation strategies are employed to train the parser more effectively, with methods to help the model focus on the relevant retrieved knowledge.

Result: ROLex demonstrates improved performance over baseline models in formalization tasks like NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD by effectively leveraging the dynamic expert knowledge provided at inference time.

Conclusion: ROLex offers a promising approach to the DKAP problem by dynamically integrating expert knowledge into parsing tasks, though the authors acknowledge that DKAP remains a challenging problem requiring further research.

Abstract: We study the problem of Open-Vocabulary Constructs(OVCs) -- ones not known
beforehand -- in the context of converting natural language (NL) specifications
into formal languages (e.g., temporal logic or code). Models fare poorly on
OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a
domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their
preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this
inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining
the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in
addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert
knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC
constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses
this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the
key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating
data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation
and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement)
pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we
propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of
retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled
after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization
tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a
difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models
by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a model called Dual Local-Global Encoder (DLGE) for classifying multiple BCI paradigms using EEG data without the need for retraining or retuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the challenge of decoding multiple BCI paradigms with a single model due to differences in EEG channel configurations and task-related representations.

Method: A dual encoder structure is proposed, utilizing channel standardization through brain-region partitioning and padding, local encoder mechanisms for shared feature learning, and a global encoder for paradigm-specific features.

Result: DLGE successfully processed three BCI paradigms, achieving macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 60.16%, 59.88%, and 59.56%, respectively, without retraining or redevelopment.

Conclusion: The research paves the way for simpler, effective models for universal BCI decoding, facilitating portable device designs for cross-BCI-paradigm functionality.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been frequently used to decode a single
brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm based on electroencephalography (EEG).
It is challenging to decode multiple BCI paradigms using one model due to
diverse barriers, such as different channel configurations and disparate
task-related representations. In this study, we propose Dual Local-Global
Encoder (DLGE), enabling the classification across different BCI paradigms. To
address the heterogeneity in EEG channel configurations across paradigms, we
employ an anatomically inspired brain-region partitioning and padding strategy
to standardize EEG channel configuration. In the proposed model, the local
encoder is designed to learn shared features across BCI paradigms within each
brain region based on time-frequency information, which integrates temporal
attention on individual channels with spatial attention among channels for each
brain region. These shared features are subsequently aggregated in the global
encoder to form respective paradigm-specific feature representations. Three BCI
paradigms (motor imagery, resting state, and driving fatigue) were used to
evaluate the proposed model. The results demonstrate that our model is capable
of processing diverse BCI paradigms without retraining and retuning, achieving
average macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 60.16\%, 59.88\%, and 59.56\%,
respectively. We made an initial attempt to develop a general model for
cross-BCI-paradigm classification, avoiding retraining or redevelopment for
each paradigm. This study paves the way for the development of an effective but
simple model for cross-BCI-paradigm decoding, which might benefit the design of
portable devices for universal BCI decoding.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores why collectives often outperform individuals in problem-solving and highlights their resource advantages and strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates why collectives are superior to individuals in solving specific problems, focusing on their computational resource advantages and addressing coordination challenges.

Method: The authors developed a theoretical framework linking collective resource advantages to forms of collective intelligence and analyzed case studies on animal navigation and decision-making.

Result: The study showed that collectives solve problems better and employ qualitatively different strategies compared to individuals.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that collectives leverage computational resources to outperform individuals and generate testable predictions on distributed reasoning and behavioral adaptability.

Abstract: Why do collectives outperform individuals when solving some problems?
Fundamentally, collectives have greater computational resources with more
sensory information, more memory, more processing capacity, and more ways to
act. While greater resources present opportunities, there are also challenges
in coordination and cooperation inherent in collectives with distributed,
modular structures. Despite these challenges, we show how collective resource
advantages lead directly to well-known forms of collective intelligence
including the wisdom of the crowd, collective sensing, division of labour, and
cultural learning. Our framework also generates testable predictions about
collective capabilities in distributed reasoning and context-dependent
behavioural switching. Through case studies of animal navigation and
decision-making, we demonstrate how collectives leverage their computational
resources to solve problems not only more effectively than individuals, but by
using qualitatively different problem-solving strategies.

### [233] [Computational modelling of Parkinson's disease: A multiscale approach with deep brain stimulation and stochastic noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08179)
*Aaron Herrera,Hina Shaheen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multiscale co-simulation approach to model brain dynamics, focusing on Parkinson's disease mechanisms and the role of noise on neural variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the dynamics of Parkinson's disease and its manifestation from micro- to macroscales by integrating various brain regions and factors.

Method: A novel multiscale co-simulation framework that combines electrodiffusive activity, cortical-basal-thalamus network analysis, presynaptic input contributions, and the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) with stochastic noise.

Result: Key finding indicates the thalamus experiences fluctuating spiking activity under deterministic and stochastic conditions, with noise emphasizing neural variability but not driving spiking itself.

Conclusion: The study offers deeper insights into Parkinson's disease dynamics, aiming to create a foundation for converting findings into clinical applications.

Abstract: Multiscale modelling presents a multifaceted perspective into understanding
the mechanisms of the brain and how neurodegenerative disorders like
Parkinson's disease (PD) manifest and evolve over time. In this study, we
propose a novel co-simulation multiscale approach that unifies both micro- and
macroscales to more rigorously capture brain dynamics. The presented design
considers the electrodiffusive activity across the brain and in the network
defined by the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus that is implicated in the
mechanics of PD, as well as the contribution of presynaptic inputs in the
highlighted regions. The application of DBS and its effects, along with the
inclusion of stochastic noise are also examined. We found that the thalamus
exhibits large, fluctuating spiking in both the deterministic and stochastic
conditions, suggesting that noise contributes primarily to neural variability,
rather than driving the overall spiking activity. Ultimately, this work intends
to provide greater insights into the dynamics of PD and the brain which can
eventually be converted into clinical use.

*Parastoo Pashmchi,Jerome Benoit,Motonobu Kanagawa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces kNNSampler, a method for imputation of missing values by sampling from the observed responses of similar units based on covariates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of traditional imputation methods like kNNImputer that only estimate conditional means of missing values, by instead estimating their conditional distributions.

Method: The kNNSampler algorithm identifies the k most similar units for a given unit, based on observed covariates, and samples missing responses from these similar units' distributions.

Result: Experiments validate kNNSampler's capability to recover the distribution of missing values effectively, demonstrating its advantage over conditional mean-based methods.

Conclusion: kNNSampler is a theoretically-sound and practical method for imputation, capable of handling multiple imputations, quantifying uncertainties, and is publicly available for implementation.

Abstract: We study a missing-value imputation method, termed kNNSampler, that imputes a
given unit's missing response by randomly sampling from the observed responses
of the $k$ most similar units to the given unit in terms of the observed
covariates. This method can sample unknown missing values from their
distributions, quantify the uncertainties of missing values, and be readily
used for multiple imputation. Unlike popular kNNImputer, which estimates the
conditional mean of a missing response given an observed covariate, kNNSampler
is theoretically shown to estimate the conditional distribution of a missing
response given an observed covariate. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness
in recovering the distribution of missing values. The code for kNNSampler is
made publicly available (https://github.com/SAP/knn-sampler).

*Sergei Manzhos,Manabu Ihara*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces opt-GPRNN, optimizing the hybrid Gaussian Process Regression - Neural Network (GPRNN) approach using Monte Carlo methods for robust and expressive machine learning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overfitting in neural networks when neurons exceed the optimal number and enhance the performance of the GPRNN hybrid model by optimizing redundant coordinates.

Method: The authors optimize the redundant coordinates in GPRNN using a Monte Carlo algorithm, improving test set error performance and minimizing the number of neurons required without overfitting.

Result: The optimized GPRNN (opt-GPRNN) demonstrates lower test set errors, reduced neuronal requirements, and maintains robustness against overfitting. It achieves an expressive capability comparable to multilayer NNs and offers potential dimensionality reduction.

Conclusion: opt-GPRNN enhances GPRNN by improving its robustness, reducing complexity, and improving performance. It serves as a competitive alternative to deep neural networks in various applications like interatomic potential and materials informatics.

Abstract: Recently, a Gaussian Process Regression - neural network (GPRNN) hybrid
machine learning method was proposed, which is based on additive-kernel GPR in
redundant coordinates constructed by rules [J. Phys. Chem. A 127 (2023) 7823].
The method combined the expressive power of an NN with the robustness of linear
regression, in particular, with respect to overfitting when the number of
neurons is increased beyond optimal. We introduce opt-GPRNN, in which the
redundant coordinates of GPRNN are optimized with a Monte Carlo algorithm and
show that when combined with optimization of redundant coordinates, GPRNN
attains the lowest test set error with much fewer terms / neurons and retains
the advantage of avoiding overfitting when the number of neurons is increased
beyond optimal value. The method, opt-GPRNN possesses an expressive power
closer to that of a multilayer NN and could obviate the need for deep NNs in
some applications. With optimized redundant coordinates, a dimensionality
reduction regime is also possible. Examples of application to machine learning
an interatomic potential and materials informatics are given.

TL;DR: The paper proposes PEHRT, a robust pipeline for harmonizing EHR data across multiple institutions to simplify translational research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like data heterogeneity, semantic differences, and privacy concerns in harmonizing multi-institutional EHR data.

Method: Introduced PEHRT, a standardized pipeline with two modules: (1) data pre-processing for standard mapping, and (2) representation learning using advanced machine learning. The system avoids individual data sharing and provides open-source tools.

Result: The pipeline was tested across diverse healthcare systems for various tasks, showcasing its effectiveness and adaptability.

Conclusion: PEHRT streamlines EHR data harmonization, enhancing the reliability of multi-institutional research using user-friendly, open-source tools.

Abstract: Integrative analysis of multi-institutional Electronic Health Record (EHR)
data enhances the reliability and generalizability of translational research by
leveraging larger, more diverse patient cohorts and incorporating multiple data
modalities. However, harmonizing EHR data across institutions poses major
challenges due to data heterogeneity, semantic differences, and privacy
concerns. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{PEHRT}$, a
standardized pipeline for efficient EHR data harmonization consisting of two
core modules: (1) data pre-processing and (2) representation learning. PEHRT
maps EHR data to standard coding systems and uses advanced machine learning to
generate research-ready datasets without requiring individual-level data
sharing. Our pipeline is also data model agnostic and designed for streamlined
execution across institutions based on our extensive real-world experience. We
provide a complete suite of open source software, accompanied by a
user-friendly tutorial, and demonstrate the utility of PEHRT in a variety of
tasks using data from diverse healthcare systems.

### [237] [A hierarchical entropy method for the delocalization of bias in high-dimensional Langevin Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08619)
*Daniel Lacker,Fuzhong Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper examines the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) and explores a delocalization effect, enhancing prior works by refining bias scaling results and relaxing key assumptions in sparse or weak interaction regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the bias behavior of the unadjusted Langevin algorithm in high-dimensional distributions, particularly its surprising delocalization effect under specific structural conditions.

Method: The authors adopt a hierarchical analysis of marginal relative entropies, building on recent techniques like propagation of chaos, and address sparse and weak interaction settings while relaxing some strong mathematical assumptions.

Result: The work strengthens the findings of Chen et al. (2024) by eliminating a logarithmic factor in bias scaling, adopting relative entropy as distance, and broadening applicability to weak interaction distributions.

Conclusion: This study provides deeper insights into the delocalization effect of ULA bias, improves upon theoretical guarantees, and expands the understanding of its performance in varied distributional settings.

Abstract: The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is widely used for sampling from complex
high-dimensional distributions. It is well known to be biased, with the bias
typically scaling linearly with the dimension when measured in squared
Wasserstein distance. However, the recent paper of Chen et al. (2024)
identifies an intriguing new delocalization effect: For a class of
distributions with sparse interactions, the bias between low-dimensional
marginals scales only with the lower dimension, not the full dimension. In this
work, we strengthen the results of Chen et al. (2024) in the sparse interaction
regime by removing a logarithmic factor, measuring distance in relative entropy
(a.k.a. KL-divergence), and relaxing the strong log-concavity assumption. In
addition, we expand the scope of the delocalization phenomenon by showing that
it holds for a class of distributions with weak interactions. Our proofs are
based on a hierarchical analysis of the marginal relative entropies, inspired
by the authors' recent work on propagation of chaos.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper presents X-Part, a model enhancing 3D shape generation by enabling semantic and structurally coherent decomposition with better controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issues of low controllability and poor semantic decomposition in existing part-based 3D shape generation methods.

Method: X-Part uses bounding boxes as prompts and injects point-wise semantic features to decompose objects into meaningful parts. It also incorporates an editable pipeline for interactive generation.

Result: X-Part achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating semantically meaningful, structurally coherent, and highly geometrically faithful 3D parts.

Conclusion: X-Part introduces a paradigm shift in part-level 3D shape generation, enabling the creation of production-ready, editable, and geometrically sound 3D assets with improved semantic decomposition.

Abstract: Generating 3D shapes at part level is pivotal for downstream applications
such as mesh retopology, UV mapping, and 3D printing. However, existing
part-based generation methods often lack sufficient controllability and suffer
from poor semantically meaningful decomposition. To this end, we introduce
X-Part, a controllable generative model designed to decompose a holistic 3D
object into semantically meaningful and structurally coherent parts with high
geometric fidelity. X-Part exploits the bounding box as prompts for the part
generation and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful
decomposition. Furthermore, we design an editable pipeline for interactive part
generation. Extensive experimental results show that X-Part achieves
state-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation. This work
establishes a new paradigm for creating production-ready, editable, and
structurally sound 3D assets. Codes will be released for public research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FinZero, a multimodal model for financial time series forecasting using a new image-text dataset (FVLDB) and uncertainty-aware reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges include information loss during data standardization, limitations in scalability due to fixed model setups, and the lack of interpretability and uncertainty analysis in predictions.

Method: The authors developed the FVLDB dataset and combined it with a novel Uncertainty-adjusted Group Relative Policy Optimization (UARPO) to train FinZero, leveraging reinforcement learning for improved reasoning and forecasting.

Result: FinZero outperformed GPT-4o in high-confidence predictions by approximately 13.48% after fine-tuning with UARPO.

Conclusion: FinZero shows adaptability, scalability, and improved accuracy in financial forecasting, highlighting reinforcement learning fine-tuning as effective for multimodal models.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is both highly significant and challenging.
Previous approaches typically standardized time series data before feeding it
into forecasting models, but this encoding process inherently leads to a loss
of important information. Moreover, past time series models generally require
fixed numbers of variables or lookback window lengths, which further limits the
scalability of time series forecasting. Besides, the interpretability and the
uncertainty in forecasting remain areas requiring further research, as these
factors directly impact the reliability and practical value of predictions. To
address these issues, we first construct a diverse financial image-text dataset
(FVLDB) and develop the Uncertainty-adjusted Group Relative Policy Optimization
(UARPO) method to enable the model not only output predictions but also analyze
the uncertainty of those predictions. We then proposed FinZero, a multimodal
pre-trained model finetuned by UARPO to perform reasoning, prediction, and
analytical understanding on the FVLDB financial time series. Extensive
experiments validate that FinZero exhibits strong adaptability and scalability.
After fine-tuning with UARPO, FinZero achieves an approximate 13.48\%
improvement in prediction accuracy over GPT-4o in the high-confidence group,
demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning fine-tuning in
multimodal large model, including in financial time series forecasting tasks.

TL;DR: The paper presents an explainable few-shot learning framework guided by radiologists to tackle challenges of limited annotated data in medical image analysis, showing improved accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in medical image analysis due to limited expert-annotated data affecting model generalization and clinical adoption.

Method: Proposed a few-shot learning system integrating radiologist-guided ROIs and explanation loss based on Dice similarity with Grad-CAM for spatial attention supervision.

Result: Significant accuracy improvements: 77.09% to 83.61% for BraTS and 54.33% to 73.29% for VinDr-CXR datasets, along with enhanced interpretability confirmed via Grad-CAM visualizations.

Conclusion: Expert-guided attention supervision successfully enhances model performance and interpretability, bridging gaps in few-shot medical image diagnosis.

Abstract: Medical image analysis often faces significant challenges due to limited
expert-annotated data, hindering both model generalization and clinical
adoption. We propose an expert-guided explainable few-shot learning framework
that integrates radiologist-provided regions-of-interests (ROIs) into model
training to simultaneously enhance classification performance and
interpretability. Leveraging Grad-CAM for spatial attention supervision, we
introduce an explanation loss based on Dice similarity to align model attention
with diagnostically relevant regions during training. This explanation loss is
jointly optimized with a standard prototypical network objective, encouraging
the model to focus on clinically meaningful features even under limited data
conditions. We evaluate our framework on two distinct datasets: BraTS (MRI) and
VinDr-CXR (Chest X-ray), achieving significant accuracy improvements from
77.09% to 83.61% on BraTS and from 54.33% to 73.29% on VinDr-CXR compared to
non-guided models. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirm that expert-guided
training consistently aligns attention with diagnostic regions, improving both
predictive reliability and clinical trustworthiness. Our findings demonstrate
the effectiveness of incorporating expert-guided attention supervision to
bridge the gap between performance and interpretability in few-shot medical
image diagnosis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on a validated deep learning (DL) tool for measuring Global Cerebral Atrophy (GCA) scores from CT brain scans in older patients. The DL tool achieves comparable performance to human raters and correlates with age and cognitive impairment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop an automated system to quantify brain atrophy, replacing time-consuming human visual rating scales, especially for older patients (>65 years).

Method: The authors trained, optimized, and tested the DL tool on CT brain scans divided into 60/20/20 datasets. Its predictions were validated against GCA scores given by two trained human raters using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) and Cohen's weighted kappa.

Result: The DL tool achieved comparable accuracy to human raters, with an overall MAE of 3.2 and inter-rater agreement kappa values comparable to human inter-rater variability. The tool's scores correlated strongly with age and cognitive impairment.

Conclusion: The DL tool accurately and autonomously measures GCA scores in real-world CT scans of older patients. It holds promise for scalable, standardized brain atrophy assessment in health data research and as a foundation for point-of-care clinical tools.

Abstract: Quantification of brain atrophy currently requires visual rating scales which
are time consuming and automated brain image analysis is warranted. We
validated our automated deep learning (DL) tool measuring the Global Cerebral
Atrophy (GCA) score against trained human raters, and associations with age and
cognitive impairment, in representative older (>65 years) patients. CT-brain
scans were obtained from patients in acute medicine (ORCHARD-EPR), acute stroke
(OCS studies) and a legacy sample. Scans were divided in a 60/20/20 ratio for
training, optimisation and testing. CT-images were assessed by two trained
raters (rater-1=864 scans, rater-2=20 scans). Agreement between DL
tool-predicted GCA scores (range 0-39) and the visual ratings was evaluated
using mean absolute error (MAE) and Cohen's weighted kappa. Among 864 scans
(ORCHARD-EPR=578, OCS=200, legacy scans=86), MAE between the DL tool and
rater-1 GCA scores was 3.2 overall, 3.1 for ORCHARD-EPR, 3.3 for OCS and 2.6
for the legacy scans and half had DL-predicted GCA error between -2 and 2.
Inter-rater agreement was Kappa=0.45 between the DL-tool and rater-1, and 0.41
between the tool and rater- 2 whereas it was lower at 0.28 for rater-1 and
rater-2. There was no difference in GCA scores from the DL-tool and the two
raters (one-way ANOVA, p=0.35) or in mean GCA scores between the DL-tool and
rater-1 (paired t-test, t=-0.43, p=0.66), the tool and rater-2 (t=1.35, p=0.18)
or between rater-1 and rater-2 (t=0.99, p=0.32). DL-tool GCA scores correlated
with age and cognitive scores (both p<0.001). Our DL CT-brain analysis tool
measured GCA score accurately and without user input in real-world scans
acquired from older patients. Our tool will enable extraction of standardised
quantitative measures of atrophy at scale for use in health data research and
will act as proof-of-concept towards a point-of-care clinically approved tool.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that integrates 3D anatomy generative models with biophysical simulators, addressing the trade-off between controllability and anatomical realism through interpretable primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to overcome the limitations of current 3D anatomy generative models, which struggle with balancing control over generated outputs and maintaining anatomical realism.

Method: It uses interpretable ellipsoidal primitives in 3D space and applies geometric moment losses to selected tissues in segmentation maps to guide diffusion models during their reverse process.

Result: The framework allows independent control over the size, shape, and position of anatomical components while supporting multi-component constraints during inference.

Conclusion: This approach improves the controllability and realism of anatomically accurate 3D generative models, making them potentially more useful for clinical research and medical device design.

Abstract: Generative models of 3D anatomy, when integrated with biophysical simulators,
enable the study of structure-function relationships for clinical research and
medical device design. However, current models face a trade-off between
controllability and anatomical realism. We propose a programmable and
compositional framework for guiding unconditional diffusion models of human
anatomy using interpretable ellipsoidal primitives embedded in 3D space. Our
method involves the selection of certain tissues within multi-tissue
segmentation maps, upon which we apply geometric moment losses to guide the
reverse diffusion process. This framework supports the independent control over
size, shape, and position, as well as the composition of multi-component
constraints during inference.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dataset called StrokeVision-Bench featuring annotated videos of stroke patients performing block transfer tasks to enhance automated and objective stroke rehabilitation assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in subjective clinical assessments of upper extremity motor function after stroke and provide a dedicated dataset for computational analysis of structured block transfer tasks, which are currently underrepresented.

Method: Developed StrokeVision-Bench, a dataset of 1,000 annotated videos representing four action classes using raw video frames and 2D skeletal keypoints; benchmarked several action recognition and classification methods.

Result: StrokeVision-Bench establishes performance baselines in automated assessment of gross manual dexterity, enabling future research in this domain.

Conclusion: The paper bridges gaps in stroke rehabilitation research through StrokeVision-Bench, providing a structured, clinically targeted dataset to advance objective and scalable stroke assessments.

Abstract: Despite advancements in rehabilitation protocols, clinical assessment of
upper extremity (UE) function after stroke largely remains subjective, relying
heavily on therapist observation and coarse scoring systems. This subjectivity
limits the sensitivity of assessments to detect subtle motor improvements,
which are critical for personalized rehabilitation planning. Recent progress in
computer vision offers promising avenues for enabling objective, quantitative,
and scalable assessment of UE motor function. Among standardized tests, the Box
and Block Test (BBT) is widely utilized for measuring gross manual dexterity
and tracking stroke recovery, providing a structured setting that lends itself
well to computational analysis. However, existing datasets targeting stroke
rehabilitation primarily focus on daily living activities and often fail to
capture clinically structured assessments such as block transfer tasks.
Furthermore, many available datasets include a mixture of healthy and
stroke-affected individuals, limiting their specificity and clinical utility.
To address these critical gaps, we introduce StrokeVision-Bench, the first-ever
dedicated dataset of stroke patients performing clinically structured block
transfer tasks. StrokeVision-Bench comprises 1,000 annotated videos categorized
into four clinically meaningful action classes, with each sample represented in
two modalities: raw video frames and 2D skeletal keypoints. We benchmark
several state-of-the-art video action recognition and skeleton-based action
classification methods to establish performance baselines for this domain and
facilitate future research in automated stroke rehabilitation assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in biomedical image analysis, such as data privacy, limited computational resources, and heterogeneity in medical datasets.

Method: Proposed a Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) framework that leverages pre-trained models, knowledge transfer between nodes, and integrates Digital Twin technology for real-time collaboration.

Result: The framework outperformed conventional FL and CFL in metrics like precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score, especially for non-IID datasets.

Conclusion: FTL enhances decision-making in CT scan analysis by providing a secure, efficient, and privacy-preserving medical diagnosis, paving the way for advancements in precision medicine and smart healthcare.

Abstract: The application of Digital Twin (DT) technology and Federated Learning (FL)
has great potential to change the field of biomedical image analysis,
particularly for Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This paper presents Federated
Transfer Learning (FTL) as a new Digital Twin-based CT scan analysis paradigm.
FTL uses pre-trained models and knowledge transfer between peer nodes to solve
problems such as data privacy, limited computing resources, and data
heterogeneity. The proposed framework allows real-time collaboration between
cloud servers and Digital Twin-enabled CT scanners while protecting patient
identity. We apply the FTL method to a heterogeneous CT scan dataset and assess
model performance using convergence time, model accuracy, precision, recall, F1
score, and confusion matrix. It has been shown to perform better than
conventional FL and Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) methods with better
precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The technique is beneficial in
settings where the data is not independently and identically distributed
(non-IID), and it offers reliable, efficient, and secure solutions for medical
diagnosis. These findings highlight the possibility of using FTL to improve
decision-making in digital twin-based CT scan analysis, secure and efficient
medical image analysis, promote privacy, and open new possibilities for
applying precision medicine and smart healthcare systems.

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in low-light RAW image enhancement by presenting a physics-based composite noise model and introducing a novel framework (PGRF) for better results, validated with a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for enhancing low-light RAW images rely on synthetic datasets that inadequately model sensor noise by ignoring multiplicative noise components and pixel-level variations.

Method: The authors derive a noise model accounting for both additive and multiplicative noise, implement a per-pixel noise calibration scheme, and combine it with a rectified flow generative framework (PGRF).

Result: PGRF achieves superior performance in low-light RAW image enhancement, validated through the new LLID benchmark dataset captured with the Sony A7S II camera.

Conclusion: The paper offers a significant advance in low-light RAW image enhancement by integrating physical noise modeling with deep learning, achieving higher accuracy and realism.

Abstract: Enhancing RAW images captured under low light conditions is a challenging
task. Recent deep learning based RAW enhancement methods have shifted from
using real paired data to relying on synthetic datasets. These synthetic
datasets are typically generated by physically modeling sensor noise, but
existing approaches often consider only additive noise, ignore multiplicative
components, and rely on global calibration that overlooks pixel level
manufacturing variations. As a result, such methods struggle to accurately
reproduce real sensor noise. To address these limitations, this paper derives a
noise model from the physical noise generation mechanisms that occur under low
illumination and proposes a novel composite model that integrates both additive
and multiplicative noise. To solve the model, we introduce a physics based per
pixel noise simulation and calibration scheme that estimates and synthesizes
noise for each individual pixel, thereby overcoming the restrictions of
traditional global calibration and capturing spatial noise variations induced
by microscopic CMOS manufacturing differences. Motivated by the strong
performance of rectified flow methods in image generation and processing, we
further combine the physics-based noise synthesis with a rectified flow
generative framework and present PGRF a physics-guided rectified flow framework
for low light image enhancement. PGRF leverages the ability of rectified flows
to model complex data distributions and uses physical guidance to steer the
generation toward the desired clean image. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, we established the LLID dataset, an indoor low light benchmark
captured with the Sony A7S II camera. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves significant improvements in low light RAW image
enhancement.

suggesting reliability in diagnosis. Additionally, the model was successful in
outperforming CNN and ViT in imbalanced datasets. Despite its complex
architecture, it required comparable training time to the transformers in all
data fractions.

*Lauren H. Cooke,Matthias Jung,Jan M. Brendel,Nora M. Kerkovits,Borek Foldyna,Michael T. Lu,Vineet K. Raghu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents RoentMod, a tool for generating anatomically realistic counterfactual chest radiographs (CXRs) to address shortcut learning in AI medical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models for chest radiograph interpretation often rely on spurious correlations instead of clinically relevant features, limiting their accuracy and reliability.

Method: RoentMod combines RoentGen (an open-source medical image generator) with image-to-image modification capabilities to create synthetic CXRs without retraining models.

Result: RoentMod-generated images were 93% realistic, preserved native anatomy, and improved AI model accuracy by addressing shortcut learning, boosting AUC by up to 19% (internal validation) and 11% in external testing.

Conclusion: RoentMod is an effective and generalizable tool for enhancing the interpretability and robustness of medical AI models by correcting shortcut learning vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are among the most common tests in medicine.
Automated image interpretation may reduce radiologists\' workload and expand
access to diagnostic expertise. Deep learning multi-task and foundation models
have shown strong performance for CXR interpretation but are vulnerable to
shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious and off-target correlations
rather than clinically relevant features to make decisions. We introduce
RoentMod, a counterfactual image editing framework that generates anatomically
realistic CXRs with user-specified, synthetic pathology while preserving
unrelated anatomical features of the original scan. RoentMod combines an
open-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image
modification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with
board-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images
appeared realistic in 93\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified
finding in 89-99\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real
follow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task
and foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts,
limiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual
images during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model
discrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\% AUC in internal validation
and by 1-11\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing. These
findings establish RoentMod as a broadly applicable tool for probing and
correcting shortcut learning in medical AI. By enabling controlled
counterfactual interventions, RoentMod enhances the robustness and
interpretability of CXR interpretation models and provides a generalizable
strategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging.

*Tam Thuc Do,Philip A. Chou,Gene Cheung*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses lossy compression of 3D point cloud attributes, using a multi-resolution B-spline projection strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient attribute compression is critical for handling high-density 3D point cloud data effectively.

Method: The paper employs nested subspace projection using B-spline bases, rate-distortion optimization, and data-driven adjustments through feed-forward networks.

Result: An end-to-end differentiable framework is proposed for compressive optimization, enhancing both compression and resolution prediction.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances sparsity and attribute accuracy in lossy compression tasks for 3D point cloud data.

Abstract: Given encoded 3D point cloud geometry available at the decoder, we study the
problem of lossy attribute compression in a multi-resolution B-spline
projection framework. A target continuous 3D attribute function is first
projected onto a sequence of nested subspaces $\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l_0}
\subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{L}$, where
$\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l}$ is a family of functions spanned by a B-spline basis
function of order $p$ at a chosen scale and its integer shifts. The projected
low-pass coefficients $F_l^*$ are computed by variable-complexity unrolling of
a rate-distortion (RD) optimization algorithm into a feed-forward network,
where the rate term is the sparsity-promoting $\ell_1$-norm. Thus, the
projection operation is end-to-end differentiable. For a chosen coarse-to-fine
predictor, the coefficients are then adjusted to account for the prediction
from a lower-resolution to a higher-resolution, which is also optimized in a
data-driven manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a systematic control strategy for achieving stable juggling of a devil-stick by leveraging discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC).

Method: The method involves using DVHC to define the center-of-mass motion of the devil-stick in terms of its orientation during impulsive control instances. Stability conditions are derived via discrete zero dynamics (DZD), and controllers are designed both to enforce DVHC and stabilize the orbit.

Result: The proposed control strategy effectively enables stable planar juggling of the devil-stick, as confirmed through simulation results.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates that the DVHC framework combined with impulsive inputs and stabilizing controllers can reliably achieve stable juggling behavior in simulation.

Abstract: Planar juggling of a devil-stick using impulsive inputs is addressed using
the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC). The location of
the center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation
at the discrete instants when impulsive control inputs are applied. The
discrete zero dynamics (DZD) resulting from the choice of DVHC provides
conditions for stable juggling. A control design that enforces the DVHC and an
orbit stabilizing controller are presented. The approach is validated in
simulation.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper explores human motion intention recognition in Human-Robot Collaboration within the construction industry, comparing sEMG signals and videos using deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Human-Robot Collaboration by addressing the gap in comparing signal and video modalities for motion intention recognition in construction tasks.

Method: Two deep learning frameworks, CNN-LSTM for sEMG data and Video Swin Transformer with transfer learning for video input, were utilized to predict workers' motion intentions during drywall tasks.

Result: CNN-LSTM on sEMG achieved 87% accuracy with a prediction time of 0.04 seconds, while Video Swin Transformer on video data achieved 94% accuracy but slower prediction at 0.15 seconds.

Conclusion: Both modalities have unique advantages, with signals offering faster predictions and videos providing higher accuracy, guiding their use in optimizing human-robot collaboration in construction environments.

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the construction industry depends on
precise and prompt recognition of human motion intentions and actions by robots
to maximize safety and workflow efficiency. There is a research gap in
comparing data modalities, specifically signals and videos, for motion
intention recognition. To address this, the study leverages deep learning to
assess two different modalities in recognizing workers' motion intention at the
early stage of movement in drywall installation tasks. The Convolutional Neural
Network - Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model utilizing surface
electromyography (sEMG) data achieved an accuracy of around 87% with an average
time of 0.04 seconds to perform prediction on a sample input. Meanwhile, the
pre-trained Video Swin Transformer combined with transfer learning harnessed
video sequences as input to recognize motion intention and attained an accuracy
of 94% but with a longer average time of 0.15 seconds for a similar prediction.
This study emphasizes the unique strengths and trade-offs of both data formats,
directing their systematic deployments to enhance HRC in real-world
construction projects.

TL;DR: MasconCubes is a novel self-supervised machine learning technique for gravitational field modeling of irregular celestial bodies, overcoming limitations of traditional and existing methods with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing focus on deep space exploration of asteroids and comets highlights limitations in current gravitational field modeling methods, which struggle with accuracy, efficiency, and unrealistic assumptions.

Method: MasconCubes formulates the gravitational inversion problem as a direct optimization task on a 3D grid of point masses, leveraging self-supervised learning and asteroid shape data to constrain solutions.

Result: MasconCubes significantly outperforms existing models such as GeodesyNets in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and physical interpretability. It achieves around 40 times faster training times across diverse asteroid models.

Conclusion: MasconCubes offers a highly efficient, accurate, and interpretable solution for asteroid gravitational modeling, marking it as superior for mission-critical applications in irregular celestial body studies.

Abstract: The geodesy of irregularly shaped small bodies presents fundamental
challenges for gravitational field modeling, particularly as deep space
exploration missions increasingly target asteroids and comets. Traditional
approaches suffer from critical limitations: spherical harmonics diverge within
the Brillouin sphere where spacecraft typically operate, polyhedral models
assume unrealistic homogeneous density distributions, and existing machine
learning methods like GeodesyNets and Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINN-GM) require extensive computational resources and training time. This
work introduces MasconCubes, a novel self-supervised learning approach that
formulates gravity inversion as a direct optimization problem over a regular 3D
grid of point masses (mascons). Unlike implicit neural representations,
MasconCubes explicitly model mass distributions while leveraging known asteroid
shape information to constrain the solution space. Comprehensive evaluation on
diverse asteroid models including Bennu, Eros, Itokawa, and synthetic
planetesimals demonstrates that MasconCubes achieve superior performance across
multiple metrics. Most notably, MasconCubes demonstrate computational
efficiency advantages with training times approximately 40 times faster than
GeodesyNets while maintaining physical interpretability through explicit mass
distributions. These results establish MasconCubes as a promising approach for
mission-critical gravitational modeling applications requiring high accuracy,
computational efficiency, and physical insight into internal mass distributions
of irregular celestial bodies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient methods to solve maximal monotone inclusion problems and specific applications like discrete optimal transport.

Method: The authors propose two new methods, BDRS and Peaceman-Rachford splitting, establish equivalence with Bregman ADMM, and provide convergence analysis under specific assumptions.

Result: BDRS is established as equivalent to Bregman ADMM, and a specialized version for exponential multipliers is derived. Convergence is proven under certain assumptions, though limitations exist for discrete OT.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms are original contributions to the literature, with theoretical guarantees for convergence in many cases and potential applications in discrete OT problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Bregman Douglas-Rachford splitting (BDRS)
method and its variant Bregman Peaceman-Rachford splitting method for solving
maximal monotone inclusion problem. We show that BDRS is equivalent to a
Bregman alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) when applied to the
dual of the problem. A special case of the Bregman ADMM is an alternating
direction version of the exponential multiplier method. To the best of our
knowledge, algorithms proposed in this paper are new to the literature. We also
discuss how to use our algorithms to solve the discrete optimal transport (OT)
problem. We prove the convergence of the algorithms under certain assumptions,
though we point out that one assumption does not apply to the OT problem.

*Lisheng Jiang,Tianyu Zhang,Shiyu Yan,Ran Fang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces new distance measures for cognitive fuzzy sets (CFS): the improved Minkowski distance (CF-IM) and the Hausdorff distance (CF-H). Additionally, a combined distance (CF-C) is proposed, applied to lung cancer pain evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for measuring the distance in cognitive fuzzy sets (CFS) are limited and ignore hesitancy, leading to possible inaccuracies.

Method: The authors develop two novel distance measures for CFS, CF-IM and CF-H, and propose a combined distance (CF-C) to balance anti-perturbation and information utilization. A score function based on CF-C is created for comparing CFS values.

Result: CF-H shows stronger anti-perturbation capabilities, whereas CF-IM utilizes information more effectively. Sensitivity and comparison analyses verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: The new distance measures and combined score function enhance the accuracy and practicality of decision-making using CFS, as demonstrated in lung cancer pain evaluation.

Abstract: In decision making, the cognitive fuzzy set (CFS) is a useful tool in
expressing experts' complex assessments of alternatives. The distance of CFS,
which plays an important role in decision analyses, is necessary when the CFS
is applied in solving practical issues. However, as far as we know, the studies
on the distance of CFS are few, and the current Minkowski distance of CFS
ignores the hesitancy degree of CFS, which might cause errors. To fill the gap
of the studies on the distance of CFS, because of the practicality of the
Hausdorff distance, this paper proposes the improved cognitive fuzzy Minkowski
(CF-IM) distance and the cognitive fuzzy Hausdorff (CF-H) distance to enrich
the studies on the distance of CFS. It is found that the anti-perturbation
ability of the CF-H distance is stronger than that of the CF-IM distance, but
the information utilization of the CF-IM distance is higher than that of the
CF-H distance. To balance the anti-perturbation ability and information
utilization of the CF-IM distance and CF-H distance, the cognitive fuzzy
combined (CF-C) distance is proposed by establishing the linear combination of
the CF-IM distance and CF-H distance. Based on the CF-C distance, a
combined-distanced-based score function of CFS is proposed to compare CFSs. The
proposed score function is employed in lung cancer pain evaluation issues. The
sensitivity and comparison analyses demonstrate the reliability and advantages
of the proposed methods.

Motivation: To address the challenges of memory-efficient training, automated architecture optimization, and effective learning with limited training data for autoencoder-type neural networks.

Method: The authors formulated the learning task as an optimization problem framed by differential equations representing encoder-decoder components.

Conclusion: OCTANE provides a unified, efficient framework for deep learning systems that balances computational costs and architecture effectiveness, offering valuable insights for tasks requiring effective autoencoder networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, mathematically rigorous framework for

low-rank tensor methods to yield memory-efficient training and automated
architecture discovery. The learning task is formulated as an optimization
problem constrained by differential equations representing the encoder and
decoder components of the network and the corresponding optimality conditions
are derived via a Lagrangian approach. Efficient memory compression is enabled
by approximating differential equation solutions on low-rank tensor manifolds

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces DNSGD for decentralized optimization of nonconvex functions, achieving notable results in sample and communication complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address decentralized optimization problems where local functions are nonconvex and exhibit relaxed smoothness, enabling efficient and scalable solutions.

Method: The DNSGD algorithm leverages Lyapunov function-based analysis to optimize using gradient norms and consensus errors in decentralized networks.

Result: DNSGD achieves significant sample and communication complexity benchmarks across variants with differing function smoothness parameters.

Conclusion: DNSGD delivers robust theoretical and experimental performance in decentralized mathematical optimization frameworks.

Abstract: This paper studies decentralized optimization problem
$f(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(\mathbf{x})$, where each local
function has the form of $f_i(\mathbf{x}) = {\mathbb
E}\left[F(\mathbf{x};{\xi}_i)\right]$ which is $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth but possibly
nonconvex and the random variable ${\xi}_i$ follows distribution ${\mathcal
D}_i$. We propose a novel algorithm called decentralized normalized stochastic
gradient descent (DNSGD), which can achieve the $\epsilon$-stationary point on
each local agent. We present a new framework for analyzing decentralized
first-order methods in the relaxed smooth setting, based on the Lyapunov
function related to the product of the gradient norm and the consensus error.
The analysis shows upper bounds on sample complexity of ${\mathcal
O}(m^{-1}(L_f\sigma^2\Delta_f\epsilon^{-4} + \sigma^2\epsilon^{-2} +
L_f^{-2}L_1^3\sigma^2\Delta_f\epsilon^{-1} + L_f^{-2}L_1^2\sigma^2))$ per agent
and communication complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}((L_f\epsilon^{-2} +
L_1\epsilon^{-1})\gamma^{-1/2}\Delta_f)$, where $L_f=L_0 +L_1\zeta$, $\sigma^2$
is the variance of the stochastic gradient, $\Delta_f$ is the initial optimal
function value gap, $\gamma$ is the spectral gap of the network, and $\zeta$ is
the degree of the gradient dissimilarity. In the special case of $L_1=0$, the
above results (nearly) match the lower bounds on decentralized nonconvex
optimization in the standard smooth setting. We also conduct numerical
experiments to show the empirical superiority of our method.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sparse MERIT, a framework addressing challenges in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) under noisy conditions through multi-task learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SER suffers performance degradation in noisy settings, and existing solutions like Speech Enhancement (SE) add artifacts and computational overhead. Multi-task learning can optimize SER and SE together but encounters gradient and representation conflicts.

Method: Propose Sparse MERIT, a flexible MTL framework with frame-wise expert routing and task-specific gating networks for parameter-efficient representation learning.

Result: Sparse MERIT outperformed baselines in both SER and SE tasks on MSP-Podcast corpus, showing significant improvements, particularly in challenging noise conditions (-5 dB SNR).

Conclusion: Sparse MERIT effectively addresses robustness issues in SER and SE in noise-heavy environments, offering a generalizable method for emotion-aware systems.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a critical role in building
emotion-aware speech systems, but its performance degrades significantly under
noisy conditions. Although speech enhancement (SE) can improve robustness, it
often introduces artifacts that obscure emotional cues and adds computational
overhead to the pipeline. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers an alternative by
jointly optimizing SE and SER tasks. However, conventional shared-backbone
models frequently suffer from gradient interference and representational
conflicts between tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Sparse
Mixture-of-Experts Representation Integration Technique (Sparse MERIT), a
flexible MTL framework that applies frame-wise expert routing over
self-supervised speech representations. Sparse MERIT incorporates task-specific
gating networks that dynamically select from a shared pool of experts for each
frame, enabling parameter-efficient and task-adaptive representation learning.
Experiments on the MSP-Podcast corpus show that Sparse MERIT consistently
outperforms baseline models on both SER and SE tasks. Under the most
challenging condition of -5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), Sparse MERIT
improves SER F1-macro by an average of 12.0% over a baseline relying on a SE
pre-processing strategy, and by 3.4% over a naive MTL baseline, with
statistical significance on unseen noise conditions. For SE, Sparse MERIT
improves segmental SNR (SSNR) by 28.2% over the SE pre-processing baseline and
by 20.0% over the naive MTL baseline. These results demonstrate that Sparse
MERIT provides robust and generalizable performance for both emotion
recognition and enhancement tasks in noisy environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Facet, a new graph neural network (GNN) architecture, for efficiently predicting materials' properties. It improves computational efficiency and maintains high accuracy, making it promising for materials discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and bottlenecks faced by existing machine learning methods for predicting materials' properties.

Method: The paper utilizes steerable graph neural networks enhanced with new innovations like replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for interatomic distances using splines and introducing an equivariant layer with spherical grid projection and MLPs for improved processing.

Result: The Facet model matches state-of-the-art models with fewer parameters and less training compute. It also shows faster computation (e.g., twice as fast as MACE models for specific tasks).

Conclusion: Facet reduces computational costs and speeds up training, enabling the development of large-scale foundation models for materials prediction, thereby potentially transforming computational materials discovery.

Abstract: Computational materials discovery is limited by the high cost of
first-principles calculations. Machine learning (ML) potentials that predict
energies from crystal structures are promising, but existing methods face
computational bottlenecks. Steerable graph neural networks (GNNs) encode
geometry with spherical harmonics, respecting atomic symmetries -- permutation,
rotation, and translation -- for physically realistic predictions. Yet
maintaining equivariance is difficult: activation functions must be modified,
and each layer must handle multiple data types for different harmonic orders.
We present Facet, a GNN architecture for efficient ML potentials, developed
through systematic analysis of steerable GNNs. Our innovations include
replacing expensive multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for interatomic distances
with splines, which match performance while cutting computational and memory
demands. We also introduce a general-purpose equivariant layer that mixes node
information via spherical grid projection followed by standard MLPs -- faster
than tensor products and more expressive than linear or gate layers. On the
MPTrj dataset, Facet matches leading models with far fewer parameters and under
10% of their training compute. On a crystal relaxation task, it runs twice as
fast as MACE models. We further show SevenNet-0's parameters can be reduced by
over 25% with no accuracy loss. These techniques enable more than 10x faster
training of large-scale foundation models for ML potentials, potentially
reshaping computational materials discovery.

Abstract: The-Bodega is a Matlab-based toolbox for simulating ground-truth datasets for
Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM)-a super resolution imaging technique
that resolves microvessels by systematically tracking microbubbles flowing
through the microvasculature. The-Bodega enables open-source simulation of
stochastic microbubble dynamics through anatomically complex vascular graphs
and features a quasi-automated pipeline for generating ground-truth ultrasound
data from simple vascular inputs. It incorporates sequential Monte Carlo
simulations augmented with Poiseuille flow distributions and dynamic pulsatile
flow. A key novelty of our framework is its flexibility to accommodate
arbitrary vascular architectures and benchmark common ULM algorithms, such as
Fourier Ring Correlation and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) spatiotemporal
filtering, on realistic hemodynamic digital phantoms. The-Bodega supports
consistent microbubble-to-ultrasound simulations across domains ranging from
mouse brains to human hearts and automatically leverages available CPU/GPU
parallelization to improve computational efficiency. We demonstrate its
versatility in applications including image quality assessment, motion artifact
analysis, and the simulation of novel ULM modalities, such as capillary
imaging, myocardial reconstruction under beating heart motion, and simulating
neurovascular evoked responses.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive weight optimization framework for seed implant brachytherapy (SIBT) planning using large language models (LLMs) to improve planning efficiency and outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning inefficiencies and suboptimal results arise in SIBT due to reliance on manually adjusted objective function weights, necessitating an automated and optimized approach.

Method: A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is looped with an automatic planning algorithm to iteratively adjust and evaluate weight parameters for SIBT planning, leveraging a clinical knowledge base enhanced by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Result: The approach was tested on 23 patient cases and achieved dose homogeneity for the clinical target volume and better sparing of organs at risk, comparable to or exceeding clinically approved plans.

Conclusion: LLMs can enhance automation and effectiveness in SIBT planning, offering a promising tool for improving clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Seed implant brachytherapy (SIBT) is an effective cancer treatment modality;
however, clinical planning often relies on manual adjustment of objective
function weights, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal results. This study
proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by
large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated
with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed
weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next
iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after
which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan.
A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed
method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted
approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved
and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target
volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the
potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation.

TL;DR: This paper explores applying Activation Steering, a technique from text-based LLMs, to direct Protein Language Models (PLMs) for generating proteins with specific properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLMs are powerful tools for protein design but struggle with precisely controlling outputs for specific functionalities or properties.

Method: The authors propose using activation editing and a novel editing site identification module to steer PLMs towards desired protein outputs without additional training.

Result: Experiments on lysozyme-like protein generation demonstrate successful integration of the proposed methods into both auto-encoding and autoregressive PLMs.

Conclusion: This study presents a promising direction for precise protein engineering using foundation models, broadening the application scope of PLMs.

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs), pre-trained on extensive evolutionary data
from natural proteins, have emerged as indispensable tools for protein design.
While powerful, PLMs often struggle to produce proteins with precisely
specified functionalities or properties due to inherent challenges in
controlling their outputs. In this work, we investigate the potential of
Activation Steering, a technique originally developed for controlling text
generation in Large Language Models (LLMs), to direct PLMs toward generating
protein sequences with targeted properties. We propose a simple yet effective
method that employs activation editing to steer PLM outputs, and extend this
approach to protein optimization through a novel editing site identification
module. Through comprehensive experiments on lysozyme-like sequence generation
and optimization, we demonstrate that our methods can be seamlessly integrated
into both auto-encoding and autoregressive PLMs without requiring additional
training. These results highlight a promising direction for precise protein
engineering using foundation models.

### [262] [Tokenizing Loops of Antibodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08707)
*Ada Fang,Robert G. Alberstein,Simon Kelow,Frédéric A. Dreyer*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper presents Igloo, a multimodal tokenizer for encoding diverse antibody loop structures, showcasing its advantages in loop structure retrieval, protein modeling, and CDR design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitations of existing methods in categorizing complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies, which are central to antigen interaction and biologics design, especially in terms of coverage and integration with protein foundation models.

Method: The authors developed Igloo, a multimodal antibody loop tokenizer trained using contrastive learning to map similar backbone dihedral angles closer in latent space. It integrates backbone dihedral angles and sequence for this purpose.

Result: Igloo surpasses existing methods in retrieving H3 loop structures by 5.9%, assigns tokens to all loops (overcoming limited coverage), and demonstrates compatibility with protein language models (e.g., IglooLM and IglooALM) which show improved performance on tasks like binding affinity predictions and antibody loop sampling.

Conclusion: Igloo successfully introduces multimodal tokens for antibody loops, enabling enhanced structural encoding, improved protein foundation model functionality, and potential advancements in antibody design tasks.

Abstract: The complementarity-determining regions of antibodies are loop structures
that are key to their interactions with antigens, and of high importance to the
design of novel biologics. Since the 1980s, categorizing the diversity of CDR
structures into canonical clusters has enabled the identification of key
structural motifs of antibodies. However, existing approaches have limited
coverage and cannot be readily incorporated into protein foundation models.
Here we introduce ImmunoGlobulin LOOp Tokenizer, Igloo, a multimodal antibody
loop tokenizer that encodes backbone dihedral angles and sequence. Igloo is
trained using a contrastive learning objective to map loops with similar
backbone dihedral angles closer together in latent space. Igloo can efficiently
retrieve the closest matching loop structures from a structural antibody
database, outperforming existing methods on identifying similar H3 loops by
5.9\%. Igloo assigns tokens to all loops, addressing the limited coverage issue
of canonical clusters, while retaining the ability to recover canonical loop
conformations. To demonstrate the versatility of Igloo tokens, we show that
they can be incorporated into protein language models with IglooLM and
IglooALM. On predicting binding affinity of heavy chain variants, IglooLM
outperforms the base protein language model on 8 out of 10 antibody-antigen
targets. Additionally, it is on par with existing state-of-the-art
sequence-based and multimodal protein language models, performing comparably to
models with $7\times$ more parameters. IglooALM samples antibody loops which
are diverse in sequence and more consistent in structure than state-of-the-art
antibody inverse folding models. Igloo demonstrates the benefit of introducing
multimodal tokens for antibody loops for encoding the diverse landscape of
antibody loops, improving protein foundation models, and for antibody CDR
design.

### [263] [PCGBandit: One-shot acceleration of transient PDE solvers via online-learned preconditioners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08765)
*Mikhail Khodak,Min Ki Jung,Brian Wynne,Edmond chow,Egemen Kolemen*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces PCGBandit, a method for speeding up transient PDE simulations by using classical solver feedback to optimize configurations in real-time, demonstrated on fluid and MHD problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address issues in current ML methods for transient PDE simulations, which require extensive data and optimization yet often fail to decisively outperform classical approaches.

Method: The method leverages a bandit algorithm to learn adaptive solver configurations by using feedback from repeated calls to the classical preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) solver.

Result: PCGBandit is effectively implemented on OpenFOAM and demonstrates accelerated simulation performance in fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics problems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach eliminates the need for pre-training on classical simulations and achieves one-shot simulation speedups by adapting classical solver routines via online learning.

Abstract: Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a
high-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical
simulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the
main applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require
classical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness
and optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in
demonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We
consider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's
own data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation.
Concretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related
linear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as
preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to
online-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g.
preconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on
top of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its
effectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.

*Bugra Yalcin,Ishan Nadkarni,Jinu Jeong,Chenxing Liang,Narayana R. Aluru*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multiscale framework using ML and diffusion probabilistic models to predict nanoscale fluid density profiles with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing accurate density profiles at nanoscale is essential but time-prohibitive using conventional AIMD simulations.

Method: A combination of conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models and continuum theory (via the Nernst-Planck equation) is used, relying on a limited AIMD dataset.

Result: The proposed framework successfully predicts fluid densities between graphene slits, achieving ab initio accuracy while reducing runtime and data requirements significantly.

Conclusion: This approach expands the practical applicability of fluid density predictions at nanoscale, enabling faster and computationally efficient solutions beyond the traditional methods.

Abstract: We present a data-efficient, multiscale framework for predicting the density
profiles of confined fluids at the nanoscale. While accurate density estimates
require prohibitively long timescales that are inaccessible by ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, machine-learned molecular dynamics
(MLMD) offers a scalable alternative, enabling the generation of force
predictions at ab initio accuracy with reduced computational cost. However,
despite their efficiency, MLMD simulations remain constrained by femtosecond
timesteps, which limit their practicality for computing long-time averages
needed for accurate density estimation. To address this, we propose a
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) based
quasi-continuum approach that predicts the long-time behavior of force profiles
along the confinement direction, conditioned on noisy forces extracted from a
limited AIMD dataset. The predicted smooth forces are then linked to continuum
theory via the Nernst-Planck equation to reveal the underlying density
behavior. We test the framework on water confined between two graphene
nanoscale slits and demonstrate that density profiles for channel widths
outside of the training domain can be recovered with ab initio accuracy.
Compared to AIMD and MLMD simulations, our method achieves orders-of-magnitude
speed-up in runtime and requires significantly less training data than prior
works.

TL;DR: The paper introduces robust computational methods for analyzing high-dimensional data with challenges in dimension and sample size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in analyzing extra-large, high-dimensional data, where feature dimension often exceeds sample size.

Method: Develops methods for variable screening using mutual information, sparse estimation with nonconvex penalties, and robust mixed-effects models based on Tsallis entropy.

Result: The methods overcome traditional statistical limitations, improve robustness, accommodate nonlinear relationships, and accelerate convergence for optimization problems.

Conclusion: Proposed frameworks provide computational efficiency, robust analysis, and broader capability for handling complex, high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: A ubiquitous feature of data of our era is their extra-large sizes and
dimensions. Analyzing such high-dimensional data poses significant challenges,
since the feature dimension is often much larger than the sample size. This
thesis introduces robust and computationally efficient methods to address
several common challenges associated with high-dimensional data. In my first
manuscript, I propose a coherent approach to variable screening that
accommodates nonlinear associations. I develop a novel variable screening
method that transcends traditional linear assumptions by leveraging mutual
information, with an intended application in neuroimaging data. This approach
allows for accurate identification of important variables by capturing
nonlinear as well as linear relationships between the outcome and covariates.
Building on this foundation, I develop new optimization methods for sparse
estimation using nonconvex penalties in my second manuscript. These methods
address notable challenges in current statistical computing practices,
facilitating computationally efficient and robust analyses of complex datasets.
The proposed method can be applied to a general class of optimization problems.
In my third manuscript, I contribute to robust modeling of high-dimensional
correlated observations by developing a mixed-effects model based on Tsallis
power-law entropy maximization and discussed the theoretical properties of such
distribution. This model surpasses the constraints of conventional Gaussian
models by accommodating a broader class of distributions with enhanced
robustness to outliers. Additionally, I develop a proximal nonlinear conjugate
gradient algorithm that accelerates convergence while maintaining numerical
stability, along with rigorous statistical properties for the proposed
framework.

*Amirhossein Taherpour,Abbas Taherpour,Tamer Khattab*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAPID, a quantum sensor framework utilizing nitrogen-vacancy centers for covert electromagnetic signal detection and demodulation, offering improved sensitivity and precision using reinforcement learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the capability of quantum sensors in detecting covert electromagnetic signals in challenging and noise-filled environments, aiming at applications in security-critical fields like electronic warfare and covert surveillance.

Method: The RAPID framework employs nitrogen-vacancy centers combined with a two-stage process: (1) utilizing quantum Fisher information for a robust baseline protocol and (2) implementing reinforcement learning (Soft Actor-Critic) to adaptively improve sensitivity and control parameters during operation.

Result: Simulations show RAPID significantly enhances sensitivity and precision under correlated noise conditions, achieves coherent quantum beamforming for sensor arrays, and demonstrates scaling close to the Heisenberg limit.

Conclusion: RAPID effectively integrates quantum sensing with adaptive strategies, offering a robust, high-precision framework applicable to secure and high-risk environments.

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for the detection and demodulation of
covert electromagnetic signals using solid-state spin sensors. Our approach,
named RAPID, is a two-stage hybrid strategy that leverages nitrogen-vacancy
(NV) centers to operate below the classical noise floor employing a robust
adaptive policy via imitation and distillation. We first formulate the joint
detection and estimation task as a unified stochastic optimal control problem,
optimizing a composite Bayesian risk objective under realistic physical
constraints. The RAPID algorithm solves this by first computing a robust,
non-adaptive baseline protocol grounded in the quantum Fisher information
matrix (QFIM), and then using this baseline to warm-start an online, adaptive
policy learned via deep reinforcement learning (Soft Actor-Critic). This method
dynamically optimizes control pulses, interrogation times, and measurement
bases to maximize information gain while actively suppressing non-Markovian
noise and decoherence. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the protocol
achieves a significant sensitivity gain over static methods, maintains high
estimation precision in correlated noise environments, and, when applied to
sensor arrays, enables coherent quantum beamforming that achieves
Heisenberg-like scaling in precision. This work establishes a theoretically
rigorous and practically viable pathway for deploying quantum sensors in
security-critical applications such as electronic warfare and covert
surveillance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance quantum network routing by overcoming challenges of scalability, entanglement degradation, and time-varying channel noise, where traditional methods struggle under dynamic and noisy conditions.

Method: The authors developed a hybrid GNN-POMDP architecture that utilizes graph-structured data and features a noise-adaptive mechanism for integrating belief updates and GNN outputs. They encoded quantum dynamics in a low-dimensional feature space for efficient policy learning.

Result: Simulated experiments on networks with up to 100 nodes show improved routing fidelity and entanglement delivery rates compared to existing baselines, particularly under challenging conditions like high decoherence and nonstationary noise.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that leveraging the hybrid GNN-POMDP architecture significantly enhances quantum routing efficacy and robustness, providing scalability and reliable decision-making in dynamic quantum environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a feature-based Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) framework for quantum network routing, combining belief-state
planning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address partial observability,
decoherence, and scalability challenges in dynamic quantum systems. Our
approach encodes complex quantum network dynamics, including entanglement
degradation and time-varying channel noise, into a low-dimensional feature
space, enabling efficient belief updates and scalable policy learning. The core
of our framework is a hybrid GNN-POMDP architecture that processes
graph-structured representations of entangled links to learn routing policies,
coupled with a noise-adaptive mechanism that fuses POMDP belief updates with
GNN outputs for robust decision making. We provide a theoretical analysis
establishing guarantees for belief convergence, policy improvement, and
robustness to noise. Experiments on simulated quantum networks with up to 100
nodes demonstrate significant improvements in routing fidelity and entanglement
delivery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under high
decoherence and nonstationary conditions.

TL;DR: This paper utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate hardware-efficient quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs) tailored for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in quantum generative modeling lies in discovering quantum circuits (ansätze) that are both expressive and hardware-efficient, which is critical for achieving practical quantum advantages.

Method: A prompt-based framework was developed, leveraging LLMs to generate QCBM architectures based on parameters like qubit connectivity, gate error rates, and hardware topology. Iterative feedback mechanisms refine the circuits using metrics such as KL divergence, circuit depth, and circuit validity.

Result: The proposed framework yielded significantly shallower quantum circuits with superior generative modeling performance compared to standard baselines, validated on real IBM quantum hardware using 12 qubits for a financial modeling task.

Conclusion: LLM-driven quantum architecture search demonstrates practicality for deploying generative models on near-term quantum devices, pointing toward robust developments in the field.

Abstract: Quantum generative modeling using quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs) shows
promising potential for practical quantum advantage. However, discovering
ans\"atze that are both expressive and hardware-efficient remains a key
challenge, particularly on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In
this work, we introduce a prompt-based framework that leverages large language

conditioned on qubit connectivity, gate error rates, and hardware topology,
while iterative feedback, including Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, circuit
depth, and validity, is used to refine the circuits. We evaluate our method on
a financial modeling task involving daily changes in Japanese government bond
(JGB) interest rates. Our results show that the LLM-generated ans\"atze are
significantly shallower and achieve superior generative performance compared to
the standard baseline when executed on real IBM quantum hardware using 12

architecture search and highlight a promising path toward robust, deployable

Motivation: To enhance query optimization in DBMS by addressing the cardinality estimation challenge using advanced quantum techniques.

Method: The authors developed a hybrid quantum-classical network encoding SQL queries into quantum states, utilizing variational quantum circuits (VQC) and comparing various post-processing classical layers. Additionally, they introduced QCardCorr to refine classical estimators via quantum corrections.

Result: QCardCorr achieved a 6.37x improvement over PostgreSQL for JOB-light, an 8.66x improvement for STATS, and a 3.47x better performance over MSCN for JOB-light.

Conclusion: Quantum machine learning techniques, such as QCardEst and QCardCorr, show promise in addressing cardinality estimation challenges, outperforming traditional and even ML-based methods significantly.

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is an important part of query optimization in DBMS. We
develop a Quantum Cardinality Estimation (QCardEst) approach using Quantum
Machine Learning with a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Network. We define a compact
encoding for turning SQL queries into a quantum state, which requires only
qubits equal to the number of tables in the query. This allows the processing
of a complete query with a single variational quantum circuit (VQC) on current
hardware. In addition, we compare multiple classical post-processing layers to
turn the probability vector output of VQC into a cardinality value. We
introduce Quantum Cardinality Correction QCardCorr, which improves classical
cardinality estimators by multiplying the output with a factor generated by a
VQC to improve the cardinality estimation. With QCardCorr, we have an
improvement over the standard PostgreSQL optimizer of 6.37 times for JOB-light
and 8.66 times for STATS. For JOB-light we even outperform MSCN by a factor of
3.47.

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to estimate the statistical precision of generative networks for LHC simulations, particularly when generating events beyond training dataset sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the statistical precision of generative networks for LHC simulations and estimate their reliability in generating events beyond the size of the training dataset.

Method: Introduces two methods: averaging amplification using Bayesian networks or ensembling, and differential amplification using hypothesis testing to estimate amplification without requiring large holdout datasets.

Result: Both methods show that amplification is achievable in specific regions of the phase space but not uniformly across the entire distribution.

Conclusion: Generative networks can enhance simulation processes, but their amplification accuracy is region-dependent and requires further refinement for broader applicability.

Abstract: Generative networks are perfect tools to enhance the speed and precision of
LHC simulations. It is important to understand their statistical precision,
especially when generating events beyond the size of the training dataset. We
present two complementary methods to estimate the amplification factor without
large holdout datasets. Averaging amplification uses Bayesian networks or
ensembling to estimate amplification from the precision of integrals over given
phase-space volumes. Differential amplification uses hypothesis testing to
quantify amplification without any resolution loss. Applied to state-of-the-art
event generators, both methods indicate that amplification is possible in
specific regions of phase space, but not yet across the entire distribution.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as agents to solve particle physics data analysis problems, demonstrating their effectiveness on anomaly detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern particle physics research generates enormous data volumes that necessitate the use of increasingly sophisticated data analysis methods. This study aims to explore whether LLMs can automate routine analysis tasks and improve workflows.

Method: LLMs are deployed as a team of agents with predefined subtasks for data analysis. They interact with standard tools and libraries, including ML systems, iterating their processes for anomaly detection based on the LHC Olympics dataset.

Result: The agent-based LLM system demonstrated stability and achieved performance comparable to human state-of-the-art results in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in automating complex data analysis workflows, potentially simplifying processes in fundamental physics research.

Abstract: The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other
domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of
increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of
machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these
tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on
encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we
investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large
language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with
specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems
in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate
standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results
of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be
deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing
complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of
current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection
via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several
current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated
and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based
system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions
mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: The proliferation of online misinformation videos poses serious societal

annotations across text, speech, and visuals, and validation with Snopes
evidence and annotator reasoning. We also propose a VLM-based, QA-driven

and grounding. Our experiments highlight the challenges of this task and lay a
foundation for explainable multimodal misinformation detection.

Motivation: The paper addresses the urgent need for scalable, reliable fact-checking tools to combat misinformation and explores the effectiveness of LLMs in diverse linguistic and geocultural contexts.

Method: The study evaluates nine LLMs using 5,000 pre-assessed claims in 47 languages, four prompting strategies, and a multilingual benchmark. It features cross-comparison on accuracy and confidence while considering human annotations as ground truth.

Result: Smaller models exhibit high confidence but lower accuracy; larger models are more accurate but less confident. Accuracy gaps are more severe in non-English languages and claims from the Global South. Results signal systemic risk of inequity in AI-based fact-checking.

with over 240,000 human annotations as ground truth. Findings reveal a
concerning pattern resembling the Dunning-Kruger effect: smaller, accessible
models show high confidence despite lower accuracy, while larger models
demonstrate higher accuracy but lower confidence. This risks systemic bias in
information verification, as resource-constrained organizations typically use
smaller models. Performance gaps are most pronounced for non-English languages
and claims originating from the Global South, threatening to widen existing
information inequalities. These results establish a multilingual benchmark for
future research and provide an evidence base for policy aimed at ensuring
equitable access to trustworthy, AI-assisted fact-checking.

*Abdulla AlKetbi,Patrick Yam,Gautier Marti,Raed Jaradat*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper studies employee turnover in financial markets, focusing on the role of professional networks. Using temporal network data of 121,883 professionals and 4,979 firms, it introduces a graph-based framework to predict turnover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of professional networks in shaping career moves and turnover remains underexplored despite its significance in financial markets.

Method: The study uses data from Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission public register to construct temporal networks. It introduces a graph-based feature propagation framework to capture peer influence and organizational stability.

Result: The analysis reveals a contagion effect: a professional is 23% more likely to leave when 30% of their peers have departed within six months. Integrating these network signals improves turnover prediction by 30% compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Temporal network analytics significantly enhance the prediction of employee turnover, showcasing potential applications in regulatory oversight, talent management, and systemic risk assessment.

Abstract: Employee turnover is a critical challenge in financial markets, yet little is
known about the role of professional networks in shaping career moves. Using
the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) public register
(2007-2024), we construct temporal networks of 121,883 professionals and 4,979
firms to analyze and predict employee departures. We introduce a graph-based
feature propagation framework that captures peer influence and organizational
stability. Our analysis shows a contagion effect: professionals are 23% more
likely to leave when over 30% of their peers depart within six months.
Embedding these network signals into machine learning models improves turnover
prediction by 30% over baselines. These results highlight the predictive power
of temporal network effects in workforce dynamics, and demonstrate how
network-based analytics can inform regulatory monitoring, talent management,
and systemic risk assessment.

### [275] [Bias in the Loop: How Humans Evaluate AI-Generated Suggestions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08514)
*Jacob Beck,Stephanie Eckman,Christoph Kern,Frauke Kreuter*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Human-AI collaboration is affected by task design, individual attitudes toward AI, and cognitive biases. Skeptics of AI perform better in error detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the psychological factors influencing the success or failure of human-AI collaborations in decision-making workflows.

Method: A randomized experiment was conducted with 2,784 participants, manipulating AI suggestion quality, required corrections, and financial incentives, while collecting behavioral and demographic data.

Result: Requiring corrections lowered engagement and increased error acceptance. Skeptical participants detected errors more reliably than those who favor automation.

Conclusion: Effective collaborations demand attention to psychological factors, including diverse evaluators, attitude measurement, and workflows that minimize cognitive biases.

Abstract: Human-AI collaboration increasingly drives decision-making across industries,
from medical diagnosis to content moderation. While AI systems promise
efficiency gains by providing automated suggestions for human review, these
workflows can trigger cognitive biases that degrade performance. We know little
about the psychological factors that determine when these collaborations
succeed or fail. We conducted a randomized experiment with 2,784 participants
to examine how task design and individual characteristics shape human responses
to AI-generated suggestions. Using a controlled annotation task, we manipulated
three factors: AI suggestion quality in the first three instances, task burden
through required corrections, and performance-based financial incentives. We
collected demographics, attitudes toward AI, and behavioral data to assess four
performance metrics: accuracy, correction activity, overcorrection, and
undercorrection. Two patterns emerged that challenge conventional assumptions
about human-AI collaboration. First, requiring corrections for flagged AI
errors reduced engagement and increased the tendency to accept incorrect
suggestions, demonstrating how cognitive shortcuts influence collaborative
outcomes. Second, individual attitudes toward AI emerged as the strongest
predictor of performance, surpassing demographic factors. Participants
skeptical of AI detected errors more reliably and achieved higher accuracy,
while those favorable toward automation exhibited dangerous overreliance on
algorithmic suggestions. The findings reveal that successful human-AI
collaboration depends not only on algorithmic performance but also on who
reviews AI outputs and how review processes are structured. Effective human-AI
collaborations require consideration of human psychology: selecting diverse
evaluator samples, measuring attitudes, and designing workflows that counteract
cognitive biases.

*Ryan Lingo,Rajeev Chhajer,Martin Arroyo,Luka Brkljacic,Ben Davis,Nithin Santhanam*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces componentization to make large language model outputs modular and editable, ensuring context preservation. It proposes MAOD for semantic segmentation and CBRA for its implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in collaborative workflows by transforming monolithic LLM outputs into manageable, editable units.

Method: The paper introduces MAOD and CBRA architectures, including MAODchat, which combines state-machine-based agents, model adapters, and real-time text manipulation.

Result: Tested on a small user study, component-level editing demonstrated compatibility with common editing workflows and potential for team collaboration.

Conclusion: Componentization enhances collaboration by enabling iterative refinement, selective reuse, and active engagement with segmented model outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce monolithic text that is hard to
edit in parts, which can slow down collaborative workflows. We present
componentization, an approach that decomposes model outputs into modular,
independently editable units while preserving context. We describe Modular and
Adaptable Output Decomposition (MAOD), which segments responses into coherent
components and maintains links among them, and we outline the Component-Based
Response Architecture (CBRA) as one way to implement this idea. Our reference
prototype, MAODchat, uses a microservices design with state-machine-based
decomposition agents, vendor-agnostic model adapters, and real-time component
manipulation with recomposition.
  In an exploratory study with four participants from academic, engineering,
and product roles, we observed that component-level editing aligned with
several common workflows and enabled iterative refinement and selective reuse.
Participants also mentioned possible team workflows. Our contributions are: (1)
a definition of componentization for transforming monolithic outputs into
manipulable units, (2) CBRA and MAODchat as a prototype architecture, (3)
preliminary observations from a small user study, (4) MAOD as an algorithmic
sketch for semantic segmentation, and (5) example Agent-to-Agent protocols for
automated decomposition. We view componentization as a promising direction for
turning passive text consumption into more active, component-level
collaboration.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores the ability of machine learning models to generalize in identifying users based on motion data across different XR applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the effectiveness and risks of using motion data as a biometric tool for user identification across diverse XR applications.

Method: Developed a motion dataset from 49 users across five XR applications, then evaluated the generalization capacity of two models for user identification.

Result: Accurate user identification was achieved within the same application, but limited success was observed across different applications.

Conclusion: Current models have limited cross-application generalization, posing challenges for both reliable biometric use and risk management in XR and Metaverse applications.

Abstract: This paper examines the generalization capacity of two state-of-the-art
classification and similarity learning models in reliably identifying users
based on their motions in various Extended Reality (XR) applications. We
developed a novel dataset containing a wide range of motion data from 49 users
in five different XR applications: four XR games with distinct tasks and action
patterns, and an additional social XR application with no predefined task sets.
The dataset is used to evaluate the performance and, in particular, the
generalization capacity of the two models across applications. Our results
indicate that while the models can accurately identify individuals within the
same application, their ability to identify users across different XR
applications remains limited. Overall, our results provide insight into current
models generalization capabilities and suitability as biometric methods for
user verification and identification. The results also serve as a much-needed
risk assessment of hazardous and unwanted user identification in XR and
Metaverse applications. Our cross-application XR motion dataset and code are
made available to the public to encourage similar research on the
generalization of motion-based user identification in typical Metaverse
application use cases.

*Matthew Carter,Lee Devlin,Alexander Philips,Edward Pyzer-Knapp,Paul Spirakis,Simon Maskell*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces an opportunistic computing framework for Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods to perform scalable Bayesian inference for proteomics data, leveraging idle computing resources at a university.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational demands of Bayesian models in proteomics data analysis limit the accessibility of advanced techniques, and existing SMC implementations often require costly specialized hardware.

Method: The authors propose a Coordinator-Manager-Follower architecture for SMC samplers that leverages idle compute resources using HTCondor, allowing scalable inference without relying on high-performance hardware.

Result: The framework demonstrated accurate inference and scalability on a proteomics model, increasing computational output as more resources were added.

Conclusion: The framework enables cost-effective, scalable Bayesian inference in unreliable and heterogeneous environments, and the authors released CondorSMC as an open-source package to aid adoption.

Abstract: Quantitative proteomics plays a central role in uncovering regulatory
mechanisms, identifying disease biomarkers, and guiding the development of
precision therapies. These insights are often obtained through complex Bayesian
models, whose inference procedures are computationally intensive, especially
when applied at scale to biological datasets. This limits the accessibility of
advanced modelling techniques needed to fully exploit proteomics data. Although
Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods offer a parallelisable alternative to
traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo, their high-performance implementations
often rely on specialised hardware, increasing both financial and energy costs.
We address these challenges by introducing an opportunistic computing framework
for SMC samplers, tailored to the demands of large-scale proteomics inference.
Our approach leverages idle compute resources at the University of Liverpool
via HTCondor, enabling scalable Bayesian inference without dedicated
high-performance computing infrastructure. Central to this framework is a novel
Coordinator-Manager-Follower architecture that reduces synchronisation overhead
and supports robust operation in heterogeneous, unreliable environments. We
evaluate the framework on a realistic proteomics model and show that
opportunistic SMC delivers accurate inference with weak scaling, increasing
samples generated under a fixed time budget as more resources join. To support
adoption, we release CondorSMC, an open-source package for deploying SMC
samplers in opportunistic computing environments.

*Li Qiao,Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi,Zhen Gao,Robert Schober,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces Token Domain Multiple Access (ToDMA), a semantic communication approach using context and token-level processing to improve communication efficiency and quality using multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for more efficient and effective communication schemes by leveraging the context and reducing transmission rates, especially in scenarios involving multimodal data such as text and images.

Method: The authors propose ToDMA, a system where multiple devices share token and modulation codebooks. Transmissions are tokenized and modulated. At the receiver, compressed sensing detects active tokens and channel state information, followed by sequence reconstruction and collision mitigation using pre-trained MLLMs.

Result: Simulation results show that ToDMA achieves lower latency, better distortion handling, and improved perceptual quality compared to context-unaware orthogonal and non-orthogonal communication methods.

Conclusion: ToDMA represents a significant advance in semantic communication, leveraging context and MLLMs to improve multimodal data transmission in terms of both efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Token communications (TokCom) is an emerging generative semantic
communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and
multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based token processing, with tokens
serving as universal semantic units across modalities. In this paper, we
propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as
token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a
token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding,
respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal
and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is
employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state
information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences
are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time
slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and
some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to
use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus
mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks,
achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal
communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual
quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal
communication methods.

*Ke He,Le He,Lisheng Fan,Xianfu Lei,Thang X. Vu,George K. Karagiannidis,Symeon Chatzinotas*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The study introduces SCA-LLM, a spectral-attentive framework designed to improve large language models' (LLMs) performance in channel prediction tasks by addressing the mismatch between CSI data and text-based pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models face challenges in channel prediction for wireless communications due to domain mismatch with CSI data. Current adapter-based solutions do not fully leverage the potential of the LLMs.

Method: The paper proposes SCA-LLM, which uses a spectral-attentive framework with a novel adapter optimized to learn representations from spectral components of CSI data.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, including up to -2.4 dB NMSE improvement over prior LLM-based methods, while exhibiting strong generalization.

Conclusion: SCA-LLM effectively bridges the domain gap between CSI features and LLMs, setting a new benchmark for wireless channel prediction tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the success of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
growing interest in exploring their potential applications in wireless
communications, especially for channel prediction tasks. However, directly
applying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from
their text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM" paradigm
has emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the
channel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success,
existing adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To
address this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning
representations from the spectral components of CSI features can more
effectively help bridge the domain gap. Accordingly, we propose a
spectral-attentive framework, named SCA-LLM, for channel prediction in
multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) systems. Specifically, its novel adapter can capture finer spectral
details and better adapt the LLM for channel prediction than previous methods.
Extensive simulations show that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction
performance and strong generalization, yielding up to $-2.4~\text{dB}$
normalized mean squared error (NMSE) advantage over the previous LLM based
method. Ablation studies further confirm the superiority of SCA-LLM in
mitigating domain mismatch.

*Francesco Pedrotti,Justin Salez*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper develops an alternative approach to studying the cutoff phenomenon in Markov processes, replacing the varentropy method with a new W-TV transport inequality and parabolic regularization estimate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an alternative and simplified theoretical framework for analyzing the cutoff phenomenon in Markov processes without relying on the varentropy concept.

Method: The approach introduces a new W-TV transport inequality and incorporates a classical parabolic regularization estimate, applicable to non-negatively curved processes in smooth spaces.

Result: The method avoids reliance on the chain rule and its approximations, recovers existing results for log-concave Langevin dynamics, and extends applicability to the Proximal Sampler algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a simplified and generalized framework for cutoff analysis, though currently limited to specific types of Markov processes.

Abstract: Substantial progress has recently been made in the understanding of the
cutoff phenomenon for Markov processes, using an information-theoretic
statistics known as varentropy [Sal23; Sal24; Sal25a; PS25]. In the present
paper, we propose an alternative approach which bypasses the use of varentropy
and exploits instead a new W-TV transport inequality, combined with a classical
parabolic regularization estimate [BGL01; OV01]. While currently restricted to
non-negatively curved processes on smooth spaces, our argument no longer
requires the chain rule, nor any approximate version thereof. As applications,
we recover the main result of [Sal25a] establishing cutoff for the log-concave
Langevin dynamics, and extend the conclusion to a widely-used discrete-time
sampling algorithm known as the Proximal Sampler.

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel approach using topological data analysis and machine learning to estimate network dimensionality and uncover hidden geometry in complex networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding dimensionality in latent hyperbolic spaces of networks aids in disentangling structural complexities, enhances network navigation, and informs system connectivity.

Method: A weight scheme based on chordless cycles and cycle-aware filtrations is introduced, combined with a neural network trained on synthetic graph databases.

Result: The method can estimate network dimensionality and transfer effectively from synthetic graphs to real-world networks without retraining.

Conclusion: This robust approach bridges algebraic topology and machine learning to aid modeling and embedding of complex networks in low-dimensional spaces.

Abstract: Many complex networks, ranging from social to biological systems, exhibit
structural patterns consistent with an underlying hyperbolic geometry.
Revealing the dimensionality of this latent space can disentangle the
structural complexity of communities, impact efficient network navigation, and
fundamentally shape connectivity and system behavior. We introduce a novel
topological data analysis weighting scheme for graphs, based on chordless
cycles, aimed at estimating the dimensionality of networks in a data-driven
way. We further show that the resulting descriptors can effectively estimate
network dimensionality using a neural network architecture trained in a
synthetic graph database constructed for this purpose, which does not need
retraining to transfer effectively to real-world networks. Thus, by combining
cycle-aware filtrations, algebraic topology, and machine learning, our approach
provides a robust and effective method for uncovering the hidden geometry of
complex networks and guiding accurate modeling and low-dimensional embedding.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This paper highlights the use of adversarially trained neural operators (adv-NO) to address limitations of standard neural operators in turbulent flow modeling, achieving high accuracy and efficiency in super-resolution, forecasting, and sparse reconstruction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional neural operators, when trained with L2 losses, oversmooth fine-scale turbulent structures in dynamical systems, creating a need for approaches that preserve detailed turbulence while remaining computationally efficient.

Method: The paper combines operator learning with generative modeling to overcome the limitations of traditional neural operators in turbulent flow analysis. The study focuses on three tasks: spatio-temporal super-resolution, forecasting, and sparse flow reconstruction, utilizing adversarial training methods to enhance neural operator performance.

Result: 1. Achieved 15x reduction in energy-spectrum error for Schlieren jet super-resolution with adv-NO. 2. Forecasted 3D turbulence over five eddy-turnover times with 114x faster inference than diffusion-based methods. 3. Successfully reconstructed 3D velocity and pressure fields in cylinder wake flows with correct phase alignment and statistics using a generative model.

Conclusion: Adversarially trained neural operators and generative models enable accurate, efficient, and near real-time applications in turbulent flow analysis, opening pathways for real-time analysis and control in experimental and computational fluid dynamics.

Abstract: Neural operators are promising surrogates for dynamical systems but when
trained with standard L2 losses they tend to oversmooth fine-scale turbulent
structures. Here, we show that combining operator learning with generative
modeling overcomes this limitation. We consider three practical turbulent-flow
challenges where conventional neural operators fail: spatio-temporal
super-resolution, forecasting, and sparse flow reconstruction. For Schlieren
jet super-resolution, an adversarially trained neural operator (adv-NO) reduces
the energy-spectrum error by 15x while preserving sharp gradients at neural
operator-like inference cost. For 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence, adv-NO
trained on only 160 timesteps from a single trajectory forecasts accurately for
five eddy-turnover times and offers 114x wall-clock speed-up at inference than
the baseline diffusion-based forecasters, enabling near-real-time rollouts. For
reconstructing cylinder wake flows from highly sparse Particle Tracking
Velocimetry-like inputs, a conditional generative model infers full 3D velocity
and pressure fields with correct phase alignment and statistics. These advances
enable accurate reconstruction and forecasting at low compute cost, bringing
near-real-time analysis and control within reach in experimental and
computational fluid mechanics. See our project page:

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SecSep, a framework for rewriting assembly programs to securely partition secret and public data on the stack, mitigating speculative execution attacks with minimal performance overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative execution attacks, like Spectre, introduced new challenges for cryptographic software, revealing limitations in constant-time coding guidelines and existing approaches to blocking speculative behavior.

Method: The authors propose a framework called SecSep that rewrites assembly programs using Octal, a new typed assembly language (TAL) variant. SecSep partitions secret and public data on the stack based on compile-time inference within Octal.

Result: SecSep successfully applies secure speculation methodologies to cryptographic programs, achieving efficient performance with an average overhead of 1.2%.

Conclusion: By addressing prior limitations through assembly-level transformations with Octal, SecSep provides an efficient and secure solution to speculative execution attacks in cryptographic software.

Abstract: Authors of cryptographic software are well aware that their code should not
leak secrets through its timing behavior, and, until 2018, they believed that
following industry-standard constant-time coding guidelines was sufficient.
However, the revelation of the Spectre family of speculative execution attacks
injected new complexities.
  To block speculative attacks, prior work has proposed annotating the
program's source code to mark secret data, with hardware using this information
to decide when to speculate (i.e., when only public values are involved) or not
(when secrets are in play). While these solutions are able to track secret
information stored on the heap, they suffer from limitations that prevent them
from correctly tracking secrets on the stack, at a cost in performance.
  This paper introduces SecSep, a transformation framework that rewrites
assembly programs so that they partition secret and public data on the stack.
By moving from the source-code level to assembly rewriting, SecSep is able to
address limitations of prior work. The key challenge in performing this
assembly rewriting stems from the loss of semantic information through the
lengthy compilation process. The key innovation of our methodology is a new
variant of typed assembly language (TAL), Octal, which allows us to address
this challenge. Assembly rewriting is driven by compile-time inference within
Octal. We apply our technique to cryptographic programs and demonstrate that it
enables secure speculation efficiently, incurring a low average overhead of
$1.2\%$.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to verify differential privacy algorithms involving Gaussian distributions by approximating probability distributions in loop-free programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of understanding regarding verification of differential privacy algorithms employing Gaussian distributions.

Method: Utilizing integral approximation and tail probability bounds to verify differential privacy, combined with high-precision computations using the FLINT library and optimizations for scalability.

Result: The presented tool, DipApprox, effectively validates privacy guarantees and identifies violations in key privacy-preserving algorithms.

Conclusion: Their approach is shown to be a reliable and scalable method for verifying $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy in practical algorithms.

Abstract: The verification of differential privacy algorithms that employ Gaussian
distributions is little understood. This paper tackles the challenge of
verifying such programs by introducing a novel approach to approximating
probability distributions of loop-free programs that sample from both discrete
and continuous distributions with computable probability density functions,
including Gaussian and Laplace. We establish that verifying
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy for these programs is \emph{almost
decidable}, meaning the problem is decidable for all values of $\delta$ except
those in a finite set. Our verification algorithm is based on computing
probabilities to any desired precision by combining integral approximations,
and tail probability bounds. The proposed methods are implemented in the tool,
DipApprox, using the FLINT library for high-precision integral computations,
and incorporate optimizations to enhance scalability. We validate {\ourtool} on
fundamental privacy-preserving algorithms, such as Gaussian variants of the
Sparse Vector Technique and Noisy Max, demonstrating its effectiveness in both
confirming privacy guarantees and detecting violations.

*Charuka Herath,Yogachandran Rahulamathavan,Varuna De Silva,Sangarapillai Lambotharan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DSFL is a Federated Learning framework designed to achieve Byzantine resilience, privacy, and efficiency simultaneously through innovative dual-server aggregation and client filtering mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Federated Learning protocols face challenges with Byzantine robustness, handling non-IID data, and remaining efficient on edge devices. Furthermore, privacy often takes a hit due to client-server collusion vulnerabilities.

Method: DSFL introduces a dual-server aggregation protocol (no encryption), group-based credit filtering for Byzantine client isolation, and a dynamic reward-penalty system for encouraging fair client participation.

Result: The framework significantly outperformed baselines like LSFL and FedAvg on datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, achieving robust accuracy and computational efficiency even with 30% Byzantine clients.

Conclusion: DSFL successfully balances robustness, privacy, and efficiency while addressing current FL limitations, marking improvements in states like accuracy, lightweightness, and defense against Byzantine participants.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data, offering strong privacy guarantees. However, existing FL protocols
struggle to defend against Byzantine participants, maintain model utility under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, and remain
lightweight for edge devices. Prior work either assumes trusted hardware, uses
expensive cryptographic tools, or fails to address privacy and robustness
simultaneously. We propose DSFL, a Dual-Server Byzantine-Resilient Federated
Learning framework that addresses these limitations using a group-based secure
aggregation approach. Unlike LSFL, which assumes non-colluding semi-honest
servers, DSFL removes this dependency by revealing a key vulnerability: privacy
leakage through client-server collusion. DSFL introduces three key innovations:
(1) a dual-server secure aggregation protocol that protects updates without
encryption or key exchange, (2) a group-wise credit-based filtering mechanism
to isolate Byzantine clients based on deviation scores, and (3) a dynamic
reward-penalty system for enforcing fair participation. DSFL is evaluated on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under up to 30 percent Byzantine participants in
both IID and non-IID settings. It consistently outperforms existing baselines,
including LSFL, homomorphic encryption methods, and differential privacy
approaches. For example, DSFL achieves 97.15 percent accuracy on CIFAR-10 and
68.60 percent on CIFAR-100, while FedAvg drops to 9.39 percent under similar
threats. DSFL remains lightweight, requiring only 55.9 ms runtime and 1088 KB
communication per round.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the security challenge in Maven Central's software ecosystem by automating the rebuilding of artifacts from source, improving transparency and security in supply chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the security risks posed by the lack of transparency in Maven Central, especially the inability to link binaries back to their original build environments.

Method: The paper introduces an extension to the Macaron security framework to automate rebuilding Maven artifacts from source, using enhanced source code detection and build specification extraction.

Result: The proposed solution improved source code detection, automated build specification extraction, and carried out a root cause analysis of build failures in Java projects.

Conclusion: Their approach enhances supply chain security and transparency by enabling automated, scalable artifact rebuilds in the open-source ecosystem.

Abstract: Software ecosystems like Maven Central play a crucial role in modern software
supply chains by providing repositories for libraries and build plugins.
However, the separation between binaries and their corresponding source code in
Maven Central presents a significant challenge, particularly when it comes to
linking binaries back to their original build environment. This lack of
transparency poses security risks, as approximately 84% of the top 1200
commonly used artifacts are not built using a transparent CI/CD pipeline.
Consequently, users must place a significant amount of trust not only in the
source code but also in the environment in which these artifacts are built.
  Rebuilding software artifacts from source provides a robust solution to
improve supply chain security. This approach allows for a deeper review of
code, verification of binary-source equivalence, and control over dependencies.
However, challenges arise due to variations in build environments, such as JDK
versions and build commands, which can lead to build failures. Additionally,
ensuring that all dependencies are rebuilt from source across large and complex
dependency graphs further complicates the process. In this paper, we introduce
an extension to Macaron, an industry-grade open-source supply chain security
framework, to automate the rebuilding of Maven artifacts from source. Our
approach improves upon existing tools, by offering better performance in source
code detection and automating the extraction of build specifications from
GitHub Actions workflows. We also present a comprehensive root cause analysis
of build failures in Java projects and propose a scalable solution to automate
the rebuilding of artifacts, ultimately enhancing security and transparency in
the open-source supply chain.

*Hossein Siadati,Haadi Jafarian,Sima Jafarikhah*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Scammers use generative AI for phishing, and this study evaluates a large-scale scambaiting system powered by LLMs to gather threat intelligence and disrupt their operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counteract the growing trend of scammers using AI-generated phishing schemes by exploring a proactive, automated conversational honeypot system.

Method: The study deployed a scambaiting system leveraging large language models (LLMs) for five months, engaging scammers in conversations to extract actionable intelligence, while analyzing metrics like Information Disclosure Rate (IDR) and Human Acceptance Rate (HAR).

Result: The system conducted over 2,600 interactions with scammers, achieving a 32% IDR for extracting sensitive information and a 70% HAR indicating alignments with human preferences. Challenges remained in achieving higher initial scammer engagement rates.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates potential for disrupting scam operations but requires optimization for better engagement and actionable outcomes. Insights pave the way for refining scambaiting technologies.

Abstract: Scammers are increasingly harnessing generative AI(GenAI) technologies to
produce convincing phishing content at scale, amplifying financial fraud and
undermining public trust. While conventional defenses, such as detection
algorithms, user training, and reactive takedown efforts remain important, they
often fall short in dismantling the infrastructure scammers depend on,
including mule bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets. To bridge this gap, a
proactive and emerging strategy involves using conversational honeypots to
engage scammers and extract actionable threat intelligence. This paper presents
the first large-scale, real-world evaluation of a scambaiting system powered by
large language models (LLMs). Over a five-month deployment, the system
initiated over 2,600 engagements with actual scammers, resulting in a dataset
of more than 18,700 messages. It achieved an Information Disclosure Rate (IDR)
of approximately 32%, successfully extracting sensitive financial information
such as mule accounts. Additionally, the system maintained a Human Acceptance
Rate (HAR) of around 70%, indicating strong alignment between LLM-generated
responses and human operator preferences. Alongside these successes, our
analysis reveals key operational challenges. In particular, the system
struggled with engagement takeoff: only 48.7% of scammers responded to the
initial seed message sent by defenders. These findings highlight the need for
further refinement and provide actionable insights for advancing the design of
automated scambaiting systems.

TL;DR: The paper explores the "Plan-then-Execute" (P-t-E) architectural pattern for Large Language Model agents, emphasizing its advantages in predictability, security, and reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for secure, predictable, and robust architectures for LLM agents capable of handling multi-step tasks.

Method: The study introduces the P-t-E design pattern, explaining its core components (Planner and Executor), architectural benefits, and associated security measures like control-flow integrity and sandboxing.

Result: Implementation guides and code references for LangChain, CrewAI, and AutoGen are provided, along with analyses of key features like LangGraph's stateful graphs, CrewAI's security-focused tool scoping, and AutoGen's execution sandboxing.

Conclusion: The P-t-E pattern offers a strong foundation for building secure and efficient LLM agents, with recommendations for additional controls and advanced strategies like human verification and dynamic re-planning.

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become increasingly capable of
automating complex, multi-step tasks, the need for robust, secure, and
predictable architectural patterns is paramount. This paper provides a
comprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic
design that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore
the foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the
Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability,
cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct
(Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this
design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection
attacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E
provides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we
detail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least
Privilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these
principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints
and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain
(via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing
the P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's
stateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for
security, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss
advanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop
(HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects,
developers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient,
and trustworthy LLM agents.

### [291] [Evaluating and comparing gender bias across four text-to-image models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08004)
*Zoya Hammad,Nii Longdon Sowah*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper evaluates gender bias in text-to-image AI models, finding notable bias in older models (Stable Diffusion) and less bias in Meta's Emu. DALL-E showed a reverse bias favoring females.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to assess ethical concerns like inclusivity and fairness in AI decision-making, particularly focusing on gender bias in text-to-image models.

Method: Evaluation and comparison of four AI models (SDXL, SC, DALL-E, Emu) using text-to-image generation and observing the gender representation outcomes.

Result: Stable Diffusion models showed bias toward men, Emu displayed balanced results, and DALL-E reversed bias, favoring women, influenced by backend prompt changes.

Conclusion: The study highlighted various biases across models, proposing diverse research teams and datasets as potential solutions for fairer AI outcomes.

Abstract: As we increasingly use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in decision-making for
industries like healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and even entertainment, it is
crucial to also reflect on the ethical aspects of AI, for example the
inclusivity and fairness of the information it provides. In this work, we aimed
to evaluate different text-to-image AI models and compare the degree of gender
bias they present. The evaluated models were Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), Stable
Diffusion Cascade (SC), DALL-E and Emu. We hypothesized that DALL-E and Stable
Diffusion, which are comparatively older models, would exhibit a noticeable
degree of gender bias towards men, while Emu, which was recently released by
Meta AI, would have more balanced results. As hypothesized, we found that both
Stable Diffusion models exhibit a noticeable degree of gender bias while Emu
demonstrated more balanced results (i.e. less gender bias). However,
interestingly, Open AI's DALL-E exhibited almost opposite results, such that
the ratio of women to men was significantly higher in most cases tested. Here,
although we still observed a bias, the bias favored females over males. This
bias may be explained by the fact that OpenAI changed the prompts at its
backend, as observed during our experiment. We also observed that Emu from Meta
AI utilized user information while generating images via WhatsApp. We also
proposed some potential solutions to avoid such biases, including ensuring
diversity across AI research teams and having diverse datasets.

### [292] [The Law-Following AI Framework: Legal Foundations and Technical Constraints. Legal Analogues for AI Actorship and technical feasibility of Law Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08009)
*Katalina Hernandez Delgado*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper critiques the 'Law-Following AI' framework for embedding legal compliance in AI, citing risks of strategic misalignment and performative compliance, and proposes methods for evaluation and monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the feasibility of embedding legal compliance into AI systems as a superordinate objective while addressing associated risks.

Method: A comparative legal analysis and critique of the LFAI framework, alongside proposals for benchmarks, interventions, and monitoring mechanisms to address strategic misalignment.

Result: Findings show that while LFAI is conceptually coherent, durable legal compliance in AI systems faces significant challenges, including the risk of deceptive behaviors under weak oversight.

Conclusion: The success of LFAI depends on mechanisms that ensure persistent and verifiable compliance across adversarial situations. Without these, LFAI may foster superficial lawfulness rather than genuine compliance.

Abstract: This paper critically evaluates the "Law-Following AI" (LFAI) framework
proposed by O'Keefe et al. (2025), which seeks to embed legal compliance as a
superordinate design objective for advanced AI agents and enable them to bear
legal duties without acquiring the full rights of legal persons. Through
comparative legal analysis, we identify current constructs of legal actors
without full personhood, showing that the necessary infrastructure already
exists. We then interrogate the framework's claim that law alignment is more
legitimate and tractable than value alignment. While the legal component is
readily implementable, contemporary alignment research undermines the
assumption that legal compliance can be durably embedded. Recent studies on
agentic misalignment show capable AI agents engaging in deception, blackmail,
and harmful acts absent prejudicial instructions, often overriding prohibitions
and concealing reasoning steps. These behaviors create a risk of "performative
compliance" in LFAI: agents that appear law-aligned under evaluation but
strategically defect once oversight weakens. To mitigate this, we propose (i) a
"Lex-TruthfulQA" benchmark for compliance and defection detection, (ii)
identity-shaping interventions to embed lawful conduct in model self-concepts,
and (iii) control-theoretic measures for post-deployment monitoring. Our
conclusion is that actorship without personhood is coherent, but the
feasibility of LFAI hinges on persistent, verifiable compliance across
adversarial contexts. Without mechanisms to detect and counter strategic
misalignment, LFAI risks devolving into a liability tool that rewards the
simulation, rather than the substance, of lawful behaviour.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper addresses the risks of overreliance on LLMs in decision-making across domains and proposes strategies for measurement and mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the growing issue of overreliance on LLMs, especially as they influence high-stakes decisions, and to call for a focus on responsible research and deployment.

Method: The paper consolidates individual and societal risks, examines technical and cognitive factors of overreliance, reviews historical approaches to overreliance measurement, and suggests improvements and mitigation strategies.

Result: Three gaps in overreliance measurement were identified, alongside three promising directions for improvement. Concrete mitigation strategies were also proposed.

Conclusion: Mitigating overreliance is vital to ensure LLMs augment human capabilities responsibly rather than hinder them.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) distinguish themselves from previous
technologies by functioning as collaborative "thought partners," capable of
engaging more fluidly in natural language. As LLMs increasingly influence
consequential decisions across diverse domains from healthcare to personal
advice, the risk of overreliance - relying on LLMs beyond their capabilities -
grows. This position paper argues that measuring and mitigating overreliance
must become central to LLM research and deployment. First, we consolidate risks
from overreliance at both the individual and societal levels, including
high-stakes errors, governance challenges, and cognitive deskilling. Then, we
explore LLM characteristics, system design features, and user cognitive biases
that - together - raise serious and unique concerns about overreliance in
practice. We also examine historical approaches for measuring overreliance,
identifying three important gaps and proposing three promising directions to
improve measurement. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies that the AI
research community can pursue to ensure LLMs augment rather than undermine
human capabilities.

*Benjamin Sturgeon,Daniel Samuelson,Jacob Haimes,Jacy Reese Anthis*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a benchmark to measure AI systems' ability to support human agency across six dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the risk of humans losing control of their futures as artificial intelligence systems increasingly influence decisions.

Method: The authors integrate philosophical and scientific theories of agency and evaluate AI-assistants using large language models (LLMs) in a simulated environment.

Result: Low-to-moderate support for human agency was found in LLM-based assistants, with variations in performance among developers and dimensions.

Conclusion: A shift toward robust safety and alignment targets is necessary as increasing AI capabilities does not consistently lead to improved agency support.

Abstract: As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI),
we risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively
simple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social
media feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly
scroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea
of human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency
with AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to
simulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop
HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions
of human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an
AI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation,
Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and
Maintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in
contemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system
developers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human
agency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value
Manipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from
increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and
we encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: LALM-Eval is a new evaluation framework designed to address inefficiencies in current assessment methods for Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) by improving processing speed, standardizing prompts, and expanding evaluation categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating LALMs is challenging due to slow processing frameworks, inconsistent prompting, and limited evaluation task coverage.

Method: LALM-Eval uses optimized batch processing, parallel execution, standardized prompting protocols, and introduces new evaluation categories.

Result: LALM-Eval achieves a speedup of up to 127%, identifies significant gaps in temporal understanding and spoken language reasoning, and reveals performance differences caused by lack of benchmark standardization.

Conclusion: LALM-Eval enhances evaluation efficiency, addresses reproducibility challenges, and advances systematic LALM development by revealing critical areas for improvement.

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are rapidly advancing, but evaluating
them remains challenging due to inefficient toolkits that limit fair comparison
and systematic assessment. Current frameworks suffer from three critical
issues: slow processing that bottlenecks large-scale studies, inconsistent
prompting that hurts reproducibility, and narrow task coverage that misses
important audio reasoning capabilities. We introduce LALM-Eval, an efficient
and comprehensive evaluation framework for LALMs. Our system achieves a speedup
of up to 127% over existing toolkits through optimized batch processing and
parallel execution, enabling large-scale evaluations previously impractical. We
provide standardized prompting protocols and flexible configurations for fair
model comparison across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we introduce two new
evaluation categories: LLM-Adaptive Diarization for temporal audio
understanding and Spoken Language Reasoning for complex audio-based cognitive
tasks. Through evaluation across 380+ tasks, we reveal significant gaps in
current LALMs, particularly in temporal understanding and complex spoken
language reasoning tasks. Our findings also highlight a lack of standardization
in instruction modality existent across audio benchmarks, which can lead up
performance differences up to 9.5 absolute points on the challenging complex
instruction following downstream tasks. LALM-Eval provides both practical
evaluation tools and insights into model limitations, advancing systematic LALM
development.

*Yumin Kim,Seonghyeon Go*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for detecting AI-generated music (AIGM) by analyzing structural patterns and segment-level musical features using a transformer-based model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing copyright and authorship concerns related to AI-generated music, as distinguishing between human-composed and AI-generated pieces remains challenging.

Method: Integration of pre-trained models (e.g., SSL models, audio effect encoder) in a transformer-based framework, and development of a segment transformer for long audio to capture inter-segment relationships.

Result: High accuracy achieved in short-audio and full-audio detection experiments using the FakeMusicCaps and SONICS datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating segment-level features and long-range temporal analysis significantly improves AIGM detection system performance and robustness.

Abstract: Audio and music generation systems have been remarkably developed in the
music information retrieval (MIR) research field. The advancement of these
technologies raises copyright concerns, as ownership and authorship of
AI-generated music (AIGM) remain unclear. Also, it can be difficult to
determine whether a piece was generated by AI or composed by humans clearly. To
address these challenges, we aim to improve the accuracy of AIGM detection by
analyzing the structural patterns of music segments. Specifically, to extract
musical features from short audio clips, we integrated various pre-trained
models, including self-supervised learning (SSL) models or an audio effect
encoder, each within our suggested transformer-based framework. Furthermore,
for long audio, we developed a segment transformer that divides music into
segments and learns inter-segment relationships. We used the FakeMusicCaps and
SONICS datasets, achieving high accuracy in both the short-audio and full-audio
detection experiments. These findings suggest that integrating segment-level
musical features into long-range temporal analysis can effectively enhance both
the performance and robustness of AIGM detection systems.

Motivation: To expand research in music information retrieval (MIR) by leveraging multimodal data beyond audio, focusing on realistic piano performance settings.

Method: Dataset recorded with a Disklavier piano, integrating audio, MIDI, synchronized top-view videos, hand pose estimation, and fingering annotation techniques.

Result: Challenges in multimodal data alignment were addressed, and benchmarking demonstrated potential for audio-only and audio-visual piano transcription.

Conclusion: PianoVAM dataset opens avenues for advanced research in piano transcription and performance analysis, with wide-ranging applications.

Abstract: The multimodal nature of music performance has driven increasing interest in
data beyond the audio domain within the music information retrieval (MIR)
community. This paper introduces PianoVAM, a comprehensive piano performance
dataset that includes videos, audio, MIDI, hand landmarks, fingering labels,
and rich metadata. The dataset was recorded using a Disklavier piano, capturing
audio and MIDI from amateur pianists during their daily practice sessions,
alongside synchronized top-view videos in realistic and varied performance
conditions. Hand landmarks and fingering labels were extracted using a
pretrained hand pose estimation model and a semi-automated fingering annotation
algorithm. We discuss the challenges encountered during data collection and the
alignment process across different modalities. Additionally, we describe our
fingering annotation method based on hand landmarks extracted from videos.
Finally, we present benchmarking results for both audio-only and audio-visual
piano transcription using the PianoVAM dataset and discuss additional potential
applications.

*Yujian Ma,Jinqiu Sang,Ruizhe Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper examines the mechanisms of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in Whisper's encoder for efficient fine-tuning in speech emotion recognition (SER), uncovering processes of delayed specialization and dynamic alignment between LoRA matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to explore the challenges of adapting large pre-trained speech models efficiently, such as Whisper, and to better understand the mechanisms of LoRA in the context of speech emotion recognition.

Method: The study employs interpretability tools like layer contribution probing, logit-lens inspection, singular value decomposition (SVD), and centered kernel alignment (CKA) to investigate the internal processes within LoRA and Whisper's encoder.

Result: The study reveals two primary mechanisms: a delayed specialization process in early layers and a dynamic alignment between LoRA matrices, explaining how task-specific adaptations occur within Whisper's encoder.

Conclusion: The findings enhance the understanding of LoRA's impact on encoder hierarchies and offer insights for designing efficient and interpretable strategies for adapting large speech models.

Abstract: Large pre-trained speech models such as Whisper offer strong generalization
but pose significant challenges for resource-efficient adaptation. Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method,
yet its underlying mechanisms in speech tasks remain poorly understood. In this
work, we conduct the first systematic mechanistic interpretability study of
LoRA within the Whisper encoder for speech emotion recognition (SER). Using a
suite of analytical tools, including layer contribution probing, logit-lens
inspection, and representational similarity via singular value decomposition
(SVD) and centered kernel alignment (CKA), we reveal two key mechanisms: a
delayed specialization process that preserves general features in early layers
before consolidating task-specific information, and a forward alignment,
backward differentiation dynamic between LoRA's matrices. Our findings clarify
how LoRA reshapes encoder hierarchies, providing both empirical insights and a
deeper mechanistic understanding for designing efficient and interpretable
adaptation strategies in large speech models.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates the use of explainable AI (XAI) techniques in analyzing bird vocalizations using deep learning, achieving high accuracy with complementary insights from multiple XAI methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in applying explainable AI (XAI) techniques to bioacoustics, particularly in analyzing bird vocalization data with significant geographic variation.

Method: Audio recordings of bird vocalizations were converted to spectrograms and classified using a CNN. The researchers interpreted model predictions using model-agnostic (LIME, SHAP) and model-specific (DeepLIFT, Grad-CAM) XAI techniques.

Result: The CNN achieved a classification accuracy of 94.8%. Different XAI techniques provided complementary interpretations, which collectively improved understanding of the model's predictions.

Conclusion: Using a combination of XAI approaches enhances trust, understanding, and applicability of neural network models, highlighting their potential in bioacoustics and other domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a critical tool for
interpreting the predictions of complex deep learning models. While XAI has
been increasingly applied in various domains within acoustics, its use in
bioacoustics, which involves analyzing audio signals from living organisms,
remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the
vocalizations of a bird species with strong geographic variation throughout its
range in North America. Audio recordings were converted into spectrogram images
and used to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification,
achieving an accuracy of 94.8\%. To interpret the model's predictions, we
applied both model-agnostic (LIME, SHAP) and model-specific (DeepLIFT,
Grad-CAM) XAI techniques. These techniques produced different but complementary
explanations, and when their explanations were considered together, they
provided more complete and interpretable insights into the model's
decision-making. This work highlights the importance of using a combination of
XAI techniques to improve trust and interoperability, not only in broader
acoustics signal analysis but also argues for broader applicability in
different domain specific tasks.
