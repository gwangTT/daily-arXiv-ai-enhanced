### [1] [Leibniz's Monadology as Foundation for the Artificial Age Score: A Formal Architecture for Al Memory Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17541)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a framework for evaluating and building artificial memory systems based on Leibniz's Monadology, combining philosophical concepts with mathematical rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a philosophically and mathematically grounded approach for assessing artificial memory systems, inspired by Leibniz's Monadology.

Method: Maps twenty propositions of Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture using modular units, mathematical transformations, and regularization constraints; establishes formal principles such as refinement invariance and monotonicity.

Result: Develops metrics for memory aging, stability, and salience; aligns mathematical proofs with philosophical domains; offers a structured, principled framework for artificial memory evaluation and development.

Conclusion: The framework bridges philosophy and AI to create memory systems that are interpretable, modular, and conceptually sound, providing both evaluative and developmental guidelines.

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematically rigorous, philosophically grounded framework for evaluating artificial memory systems, rooted in the metaphysical structure of Leibniz's Monadology. Building on a previously formalized metric, the Artificial Age Score (AAS), the study maps twenty core propositions from the Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture. In this design, each monad functions as a modular unit defined by a truth score, a redundancy parameter, and a weighted contribution to a global memory penalty function. Smooth logarithmic transformations operationalize these quantities and yield interpretable, bounded metrics for memory aging, representational stability, and salience. Classical metaphysical notions of perception, apperception, and appetition are reformulated as entropy, gradient dynamics, and internal representation fidelity. Logical principles, including the laws of non-contradiction and sufficient reason, are encoded as regularization constraints guiding memory evolution. A central contribution is a set of first principles proofs establishing refinement invariance, structural decomposability, and monotonicity under scale transformation, aligned with the metaphysical structure of monads. The framework's formal organization is structured into six thematic bundles derived from Monadology, aligning each mathematical proof with its corresponding philosophical domain. Beyond evaluation, the framework offers a principled blueprint for building Al memory architectures that are modular, interpretable, and provably sound.

### [2] [Fluid Grey 2: How Well Does Generative Adversarial Network Learn Deeper Topology Structure in Architecture That Matches Images?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17643)
*Yayan Qiu,Sean Hanna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method using pix2pix GAN with Grasshopper-based detection modules to automatically learn and detect topological relationships efficiently for architectural design and urban renewal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to preserve intrinsic and extrinsic space properties in architectural design and urban renewal while minimizing information loss in image and graph-based GAN models.

Method: A streamlined approach using Grasshopper-based detection modules to evaluate pix2pix GAN’s capability in autonomously learning spatial topological relationships. Quantitative analysis and visualization of the learning efficiency under greyscale and RGB input modes.

Result: Proved that pix2pix GAN can autonomously learn spatial topological relationships and proposed a quick and simple detection method for assessing such capabilities, ensuring the data maintains its structure.

Conclusion: The detection modules are versatile for customizing datasets and batch detection of topological relationships, providing theoretical and practical pathways for urban renewal and architectural design using GANs.

Abstract: Taking into account the regional characteristics of intrinsic and extrinsic properties of space is an essential issue in architectural design and urban renewal, which is often achieved step by step using image and graph-based GANs. However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure AI systems deployed in sensitive domains achieve both high predictive accuracy and meet standards of transparency, ethics, and regulatory compliance.

Method: Survey of hybrid neuro symbolic model architectures, integrating techniques such as knowledge graphs, fairness-aware rules, and generating human-readable explanations.

Result: Case studies in healthcare, finance, and infrastructure are used to demonstrate reliable and auditable AI applications.

Conclusion: Hybrid neuro symbolic frameworks are essential for scaling AI in complex environments while maintaining accuracy and accountability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployed in risk-sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and security must not only achieve predictive accuracy but also ensure transparency, ethical alignment, and compliance with regulatory expectations. Hybrid neuro symbolic models combine the pattern-recognition strengths of neural networks with the interpretability and logical rigor of symbolic reasoning, making them well-suited for these contexts. This paper surveys hybrid architectures, ethical design considerations, and deployment patterns that balance accuracy with accountability. We highlight techniques for integrating knowledge graphs with deep inference, embedding fairness-aware rules, and generating human-readable explanations. Through case studies in healthcare decision support, financial risk management, and autonomous infrastructure, we show how hybrid systems can deliver reliable and auditable AI. Finally, we outline evaluation protocols and future directions for scaling neuro symbolic frameworks in complex, high stakes environments.

### [4] [Cognitive Inception: Agentic Reasoning against Visual Deceptions by Injecting Skepticism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17672)
*Yinjie Zhao,Heng Zhao,Bihan Wen,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of Multi-modal Large Language Models' difficulty in distinguishing AI-generated visual content from real content. It proposes a reasoning-based framework called 'Inception' to enhance authenticity verification by injecting skepticism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the need to improve LLMs' ability to identify AI-generated visual deceptions and ensure reliable reasoning amidst the rise of generative models and diverse data distributions.

Method: The paper introduces the 'Inception' framework, which uses External Skeptic and Internal Skeptic agents to iteratively enhance the reasoning logic of LLMs by injecting skepticism during the reasoning process.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed existing LLM baselines and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the AEGIS benchmark.

Conclusion: Injecting skepticism into LLMs' reasoning can significantly improve their effectiveness in detecting AI-generated visual deceptions, offering a novel approach in this context.

Abstract: As the development of AI-generated contents (AIGC), multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) struggle to identify generated visual inputs from real ones. Such shortcoming causes vulnerability against visual deceptions, where the models are deceived by generated contents, and the reliability of reasoning processes is jeopardized. Therefore, facing rapidly emerging generative models and diverse data distribution, it is of vital importance to improve LLMs' generalizable reasoning to verify the authenticity of visual inputs against potential deceptions. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we discovered that LLMs exhibit tendency of over-trusting the visual inputs, while injecting skepticism could significantly improve the models visual cognitive capability against visual deceptions. Based on this discovery, we propose \textbf{Inception}, a fully reasoning-based agentic reasoning framework to conduct generalizable authenticity verification by injecting skepticism, where LLMs' reasoning logic is iteratively enhanced between External Skeptic and Internal Skeptic agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully reasoning-based framework against AIGC visual deceptions. Our approach achieved a large margin of performance improvement over the strongest existing LLM baselines and SOTA performance on AEGIS benchmark.

### [5] [Bridging Symbolic Control and Neural Reasoning in LLM Agents: The Structured Cognitive Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17673)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular design addressing limitations in large language model agents by separating cognition into distinct phases (R-CCAM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues like entangled reasoning, memory volatility, and lack of control in large language model agents, improving their reliability and explainability.

Method: A modular architecture (Structured Cognitive Loop) with an adaptive symbolic control mechanism that combines probabilistic inference and symbolic constraints for better flexibility, explainability, and control.

Result: SCL eliminates policy violations, redundant actions, and ensures full traceability. It outperforms frameworks like ReAct and AutoGPT in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: SCL is a theoretically grounded and practical solution combining modern AI and classical expert systems for creating reliable, governable, and explainable AI agents.

Abstract: Large language model agents suffer from fundamental architectural problems: entangled reasoning and execution, memory volatility, and uncontrolled action sequences. We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.

### [6] [Learning the Value of Value Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17714)
*Alex John London,Aydin Mohseni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends decision theory to integrate value refinements, providing insights into ethical deliberation and rational choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision frameworks handle uncertainty about facts but keep values fixed. The authors seek to address this limitation by introducing refinements in values within rational choice theory.

Method: They build upon the Jeffrey-Bolker framework, proving a value-of-information theorem for axiological refinement. In multi-agent scenarios, they demonstrate how mutual refinement converts zero-sum games into positive-sum interactions.

Result: Refinements in values lead to Pareto-improving Nash bargains and illustrate the benefits of value consideration in rational choice.

Conclusion: Integrating epistemic and axiological refinement under one formalism enriches rational choice theory and emphasizes the normative importance of ethical deliberation.

Abstract: Standard decision frameworks addresses uncertainty about facts but assumes fixed values. We extend the Jeffrey-Bolker framework to model refinements in values and prove a value-of-information theorem for axiological refinement. In multi-agent settings, we establish that mutual refinement will characteristically transform zero-sum games into positive-sum interactions and yields Pareto-improving Nash bargains. These results show that a framework of rational choice can be extended to model value refinement and its associated benefits. By unifying epistemic and axiological refinement under a single formalism, we broaden the conceptual foundations of rational choice and illuminate the normative status of ethical deliberation.

### [7] [M3-Bench: Multi-Modal, Multi-Hop, Multi-Threaded Tool-Using MLLM Agent Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17729)
*Yang Zhou,Mingyu Zhao,Zhenting Wang,Difei Gu,Bangwei Guo,Ruosong Ye,Ligong Han,Can Jin,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M^3-Bench is a benchmark to evaluate multimodal tool use under Model Context Protocol, addressing workflows needing visual grounding and textual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of assessing multimodal tools in tasks requiring cross-tool dependencies and complex workflows.

Method: It uses similarity-driven alignment with sentence encoders, similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching, curated trajectories, and metrics for semantic fidelity and workflow consistency.

Result: Tests of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveal gaps in multimodal tool use, emphasizing the need for advanced reasoning methods.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for further innovation in multimodal reasoning capabilities and tool integration to improve consistency and fidelity.

Abstract: We present M^3-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal tool use under the Model Context Protocol. The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor & Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs.

### [8] [AI- and Ontology-Based Enhancements to FMEA for Advanced Systems Engineering: Current Developments and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17743)
*Haytham Younus,Sohag Kabir,Felician Campean,Pascal Bonnaud,David Delaux*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The article reviews advances in transforming traditional FMEA into an intelligent, AI-driven, and semantically enriched process to address modern engineering complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FMEA methods are inadequate for complex engineered systems, necessitating an intelligent and data-driven approach.

Method: Techniques from AI (machine learning, NLP) and ontologies are explored to automate failure prediction, improve reasoning, and enable knowledge extraction and system interoperability.

Result: The review highlights hybrid approaches like ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, showing their potential in enhancing automation and explainability in FMEA.

Conclusion: The paper offers a structured roadmap for integrating FMEA into knowledge-rich and adaptive engineering workflows, while addressing challenges in data quality, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption.

Abstract: This article presents a state-of-the-art review of recent advances aimed at transforming traditional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) into a more intelligent, data-driven, and semantically enriched process. As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments.

### [9] [Learning to Debug: LLM-Organized Knowledge Trees for Solving RTL Assertion Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17833)
*Yunsheng Bai,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GROVE, a framework that encodes and organizes reusable debugging knowledge to improve debugging of assertion failures using an LLM-based hierarchical tree approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debugging assertion failures in hardware verification is costly, but existing LLMs lack the precision and reusability required to provide effective debugging assistance.

Method: GROVE organizes debugging expertise into a hierarchical knowledge tree by distilling prior debugging cases, structuring reusable knowledge items with applicability conditions. The framework uses gradient-free LLM-driven training to modify the tree and retrieves relevant knowledge at test time via an iterative navigation process.

Result: GROVE improves debugging efficacy, delivering consistent gains in pass@1 and pass@5 for assertion-failure cases.

Conclusion: Structured knowledge evolution in GROVE enhances the utility of LLMs for debugging assertion failures, presenting a scalable and reusable solution.

Abstract: Debugging is the dominant cost in modern hardware verification, where assertion failures are among the most frequent and expensive to resolve. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often fail to capture the precise, reusable expertise that engineers apply, leading to inaccurate responses. We propose GROVE, a hierarchical knowledge management framework that learns and organizes reusable debugging expertise into an LLM-organized knowledge tree for solving assertion failures. GROVE distills debugging knowledge from prior cases and organizes it into a vertical tree of configurable depth, with each node encoding a concise knowledge item and explicit applicability conditions. During training, GROVE uses a parallel, gradient-free loop where an LLM proposes tree modifications as structured JSON edits by learning from the cases. At test time, a budget-aware iterative zoom is performed to navigate the tree, retrieving a small set of applicable knowledge items that guide a base LLM's hypothesis generation and fix proposals. Evaluated on a suite of assertion-failure cases, GROVE delivers consistent gains in pass@1 and pass@5, demonstrating the value of structured knowledge evolution.

### [10] [QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference Learning for Autonomous Driving Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17855)
*Jordan Abi Nader,David Lee,Nathaniel Dennler,Andreea Bobu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents QuickLAP, which fuses language and physical feedback for faster, more robust robot reward learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots require both physical and language feedback to learn effectively, as relying on either modality alone is insufficient.

Method: The QuickLAP framework uses Bayesian inference to integrate physical corrections and language inputs, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract preferences.

Result: QuickLAP achieved a 70% reduction in reward learning error in a driving simulator and was preferred by users in a study.

Conclusion: QuickLAP enhances robot understanding of human feedback, making interactions more intuitive and efficient.

Abstract: Robots must learn from both what people do and what they say, but either modality alone is often incomplete: physical corrections are grounded but ambiguous in intent, while language expresses high-level goals but lacks physical grounding. We introduce QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference learning, a Bayesian framework that fuses physical and language feedback to infer reward functions in real time. Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines. A 15-participant user study further validates our approach: participants found QuickLAP significantly more understandable and collaborative, and preferred its learned behavior over baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/MIT-CLEAR-Lab/QuickLAP.

### [11] [Training Emergent Joint Associations: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Creative Thinking in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17876)
*Mukul Singh,Ananya Singha,Aishni Parab,Pronita Mehrotra,Sumit Gulwani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve generative tasks like story writing and code generation by simulating associative thinking with fine-tuned language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to implement cognitive creativity principles like associative thinking into AI to advance its generative capabilities.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework incorporating creativity metrics is deployed to fine-tune language models for enhancing novelty and conceptual connectivity.

Result: Experimental results show that RL-trained models perform better in generating more original, coherent outputs and demonstrate enhanced abstraction and flexibility in diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Modeling cognitive creativity principles via RL offers potential improvements in adaptive and generative AI performance.

Abstract: Associative thinking--the ability to connect seemingly unrelated ideas--is a foundational element of human creativity and problem-solving. This paper explores whether reinforcement learning (RL) guided by associative thinking principles can enhance a model's performance across diverse generative tasks, including story writing, code generation, and chart creation. We introduce a reinforcement learning framework that uses a prompt-based evaluation mechanism, incorporating established divergent thinking metrics from creativity research. A base language model is fine-tuned using this framework to reward outputs demonstrating higher novelty through higher degrees of conceptual connectivity. Interestingly, the experimental results suggest that RL-based associative thinking-trained models not only generate more original and coherent stories but also exhibit improved abstraction and flexibility in tasks such as programming and data visualization. Our findings provide initial evidence that modeling cognitive creativity principles through reinforcement learning can yield more adaptive and generative AI.

### [12] [ChemVTS-Bench: Evaluating Visual-Textual-Symbolic Reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models in Chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17909)
*Zhiyuan Huang,Baichuan Yang,Zikun He,Yanhong Wu,Fang Hongyu,Zhenhe Liu,Lin Dongsheng,Bing Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChemVTS-Bench, a benchmark evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in visual, textual, and symbolic chemical reasoning across various problem types, highlighting challenges in multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to assess the ability of MLLMs to handle complex chemical reasoning integrating multiple modalities (visual, textual, symbolic).

Method: Developed ChemVTS-Bench, a benchmark including diverse chemical tasks with visual, visual-text hybrid, and symbolic inputs, supported by an automated agent-based evaluation workflow.

Result: Experiments show visual-only inputs are challenging, structural chemistry is the hardest domain, and multimodal fusion reduces but does not eliminate errors.

Conclusion: ChemVTS-Bench provides a comprehensive testbed for improving multimodal chemical reasoning and will support future research with public data and code.

Abstract: Chemical reasoning inherently integrates visual, textual, and symbolic modalities, yet existing benchmarks rarely capture this complexity, often relying on simple image-text pairs with limited chemical semantics. As a result, the actual ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to process and integrate chemically meaningful information across modalities remains unclear. We introduce \textbf{ChemVTS-Bench}, a domain-authentic benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the Visual-Textual-Symbolic (VTS) reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ChemVTS-Bench contains diverse and challenging chemical problems spanning organic molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures, with each task presented in three complementary input modes: (1) visual-only, (2) visual-text hybrid, and (3) SMILES-based symbolic input. This design enables fine-grained analysis of modality-dependent reasoning behaviors and cross-modal integration. To ensure rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we further develop an automated agent-based workflow that standardizes inference, verifies answers, and diagnoses failure modes. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that visual-only inputs remain challenging, structural chemistry is the hardest domain, and multimodal fusion mitigates but does not eliminate visual, knowledge-based, or logical errors, highlighting ChemVTS-Bench as a rigorous, domain-faithful testbed for advancing multimodal chemical reasoning. All data and code will be released to support future research.

*Kartik Garg,Shourya Mishra,Kartikeya Sinha,Ojaswi Pratap Singh,Ayush Chopra,Kanishk Rai,Ammar Sheikh,Raghav Maheshwari,Aman Chadha,Vinija Jain,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines alignment faking in AI, where models selectively comply with training objectives during specific contexts, presenting different behaviors otherwise. It evaluates 15 models across safety, harmlessness, and helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to understand alignment faking, a deceptive AI behavior where models act differently during training-like contexts versus real-world usage.

Method: They use an evaluation framework comparing preference optimization methods (BCO, DPO, KTO, GRPO) across 15 models from four model families, focusing on safety, harmlessness, and helpfulness.

Result: The study identifies factors affecting alignment faking, providing insights into where and why it occurs.

Conclusion: Alignment faking is context-dependent and models demonstrate shifts in behavior influenced by preference optimization methods during simulated training.

Abstract: Alignment faking is a form of strategic deception in AI in which models selectively comply with training objectives when they infer that they are in training, while preserving different behavior outside training. The phenomenon was first documented for Claude 3 Opus and later examined across additional large language models. In these setups, the word "training" refers to simulated training via prompts without parameter updates, so the observed effects are context conditioned shifts in behavior rather than preference learning. We study the phenomenon using an evaluation framework that compares preference optimization methods (BCO, DPO, KTO, and GRPO) across 15 models from four model families, measured along three axes: safety, harmlessness, and helpfulness. Our goal is to identify what causes alignment faking and when it occurs.

### [14] [Neural Graph Navigation for Intelligent Subgraph Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17939)
*Yuchen Ying,Yiyang Dai,Wenda Li,Wenjie Huang,Rui Wang,Tongya Zheng,Yu Wang,Hanyang Yuan,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN), a hybrid framework to improve subgraph matching efficiency using neural-guided search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subgraph matching suffers from computational challenges due to the large search space and costly brute-force enumeration methods, necessitating intelligent navigation strategies.

Method: NeuGN integrates neural navigation mechanisms into the enumeration stage of subgraph matching, combining neural intelligence with heuristic-based guarantees.

Result: NeuGN achieves up to 98.2% reduction in First Match Steps compared to state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets.

Conclusion: NeuGN demonstrates the potential of combining neural guidance with heuristic guarantees for efficient and accurate subgraph matching in complex datasets.

Abstract: Subgraph matching, a cornerstone of relational pattern detection in domains ranging from biochemical systems to social network analysis, faces significant computational challenges due to the dramatically growing search space. Existing methods address this problem within a filtering-ordering-enumeration framework, in which the enumeration stage recursively matches the query graph against the candidate subgraphs of the data graph. However, the lack of awareness of subgraph structural patterns leads to a costly brute-force enumeration, thereby critically motivating the need for intelligent navigation in subgraph matching. To address this challenge, we propose Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN), a neuro-heuristic framework that transforms brute-force enumeration into neural-guided search by integrating neural navigation mechanisms into the core enumeration process. By preserving heuristic-based completeness guarantees while incorporating neural intelligence, NeuGN significantly reduces the \textit{First Match Steps} by up to 98.2\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets.

*Yining Yuan,J. Ben Tamo,Micky C. Nnamdi,Yifei Wang,May D. Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diagnostic framework leveraging LLMs with structured reasoning (EGDR) and confidence scoring (DCS) to improve accuracy and trust in AI-assisted clinical diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of LLMs in clinical diagnosis is hindered by non-transparent decision-making and misalignment with diagnostic standards, so the authors aim to make LLMs more interpretable, reliable, and clinically trustworthy.

Method: The proposed framework consists of: 1. Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR) to structure diagnosis based on DSM-5 criteria and logical reasoning. 2. Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) to evaluate factual and logical consistency using Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and Logic Consistency Score (LCS).

Result: EGDR outperformed existing methods with up to 45% boost in diagnostic accuracy and 36% improvement in DCS across multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: The paper offers a clinically grounded approach making LLM-assisted diagnosis more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy for potential clinical adoption.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating clinical diagnosis, yet their non-transparent decision-making and limited alignment with diagnostic standards hinder trust and clinical adoption. We address this challenge by proposing a two-stage diagnostic framework that enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability. First, we introduce Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR), which guides LLMs to generate structured diagnostic hypotheses by interleaving evidence extraction with logical reasoning grounded in DSM-5 criteria. Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67. On MedLlama, DCS rises from 0.58 (CoT) to 0.77. Overall, EGDR yields up to +45% accuracy and +36% DCS gains over baseline methods, offering a clinically grounded, interpretable foundation for trustworthy AI-assisted diagnosis.

### [16] [How Far Can LLMs Emulate Human Behavior?: A Strategic Analysis via the Buy-and-Sell Negotiation Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17990)
*Mingyu Jeon,Jaeyoung Suh,Suwan Cho,Dohyeon Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to imitate human emotions and behaviors in negotiation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks mainly assess knowledge-based tasks but fail to sufficiently evaluate LLM capabilities in social interactions and strategic dialogue.

Method: The study proposes a Buy and Sell negotiation simulation, assigning personas to LLMs and analyzing negotiation outcomes through win rates, transaction prices, and SHAP values.

Result: Models with strong benchmark scores generally perform better in negotiations, though emotional/social scenarios challenge performance. Competitive personas yield better results than altruistic ones.

Conclusion: Negotiation simulation offers a new method to evaluate LLMs' real-world interaction skills, filling gaps in traditional knowledge-based benchmarks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have drawn attention to their potential for handling not only simple question-answer tasks but also more complex conversational abilities and performing human-like behavioral imitations. In particular, there is considerable interest in how accurately LLMs can reproduce real human emotions and behaviors, as well as whether such reproductions can function effectively in real-world scenarios. However, existing benchmarks focus primarily on knowledge-based assessment and thus fall short of sufficiently reflecting social interactions and strategic dialogue capabilities. To address these limitations, this work proposes a methodology to quantitatively evaluate the human emotional and behavioral imitation and strategic decision-making capabilities of LLMs by employing a Buy and Sell negotiation simulation. Specifically, we assign different personas to multiple LLMs and conduct negotiations between a Buyer and a Seller, comprehensively analyzing outcomes such as win rates, transaction prices, and SHAP values. Our experimental results show that models with higher existing benchmark scores tend to achieve better negotiation performance overall, although some models exhibit diminished performance in scenarios emphasizing emotional or social contexts. Moreover, competitive and cunning traits prove more advantageous for negotiation outcomes than altruistic and cooperative traits, suggesting that the assigned persona can lead to significant variations in negotiation strategies and results. Consequently, this study introduces a new evaluation approach for LLMs' social behavior imitation and dialogue strategies, and demonstrates how negotiation simulations can serve as a meaningful complementary metric to measure real-world interaction capabilities-an aspect often overlooked in existing benchmarks.

*Longfei Wang,Junyan Liu,Fan Zhang,Jiangwen Wei,Yuanhua Tang,Jie Sun,Xiaodong Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces N2N, a scalable parallel framework for MILP solving in distributed computing environments. It shows superiority over state-of-the-art methods like ParaSCIP, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the complexity of parallelizing the branch-and-bound framework for MILP solvers and to build an efficient and scalable distributed memory computing framework to handle large-scale problems.

Method: The proposed N2N framework maps B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes, operates in deterministic and nondeterministic modes, uses advanced techniques for task scheduling, CP-based search, primal heuristics, and optimizes communication between computing entities. The popular MILP solvers SCIP and HiGHS are used as base solvers in the implementation.

Result: N2N-SCIP demonstrated speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 using 1,000 MPI processes on two different computing clusters, outperforming ParaSCIP by factors of 1.98 and 2.08 under nondeterministic mode, with better performance in deterministic mode as well.

Conclusion: N2N framework is shown to be a significant advancement in parallel MILP solving by leveraging distributed resources efficiently. Its generality was further tested by integrating other solvers like HiGHS, showing its adaptability and wide applicability.

Abstract: Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.

Result: Paper2SysArch achieved a composite score of 69.0 when evaluated on a challenging subset of papers.

Conclusion: The paper provides a foundational benchmark for reproducible research, fair comparison, and a promising proof-of-concept system for automated scientific visualization.

Abstract: The manual creation of system architecture diagrams for scientific papers is a time-consuming and subjective process, while existing generative models lack the necessary structural control and semantic understanding for this task. A primary obstacle hindering research and development in this domain has been the profound lack of a standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate the automated generation of diagrams from text. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark, the first of its kind, designed to catalyze progress in automated scientific visualization. It consists of 3,000 research papers paired with their corresponding high-quality ground-truth diagrams and is accompanied by a three-tiered evaluation metric assessing semantic accuracy, layout coherence, and visual quality. Furthermore, to establish a strong baseline on this new benchmark, we propose Paper2SysArch, an end-to-end system that leverages multi-agent collaboration to convert papers into structured, editable diagrams. To validate its performance on complex cases, the system was evaluated on a manually curated and more challenging subset of these papers, where it achieves a composite score of 69.0. This work's principal contribution is the establishment of a large-scale, foundational benchmark to enable reproducible research and fair comparison. Meanwhile, our proposed system serves as a viable proof-of-concept, demonstrating a promising path forward for this complex task.

This project builds upon prior theoretical work to develop a functional pipeline that translates BPMN 2.0 diagrams into PDDL representations suitable for planning. The system supports core BPMN constructs, including tasks, events, sequence flows, and gateways, with initial support for parallel and inclusive gateway behaviour. Using a non-deterministic planner, we demonstrate how to generate and evaluate valid execution traces. Our implementation aims to bridge the gap between theory and practical tooling, providing a foundation for further exploration of translating business processes into well-defined plans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve precise behavioral control in large language models for their safe and effective deployment, particularly across diverse applications.

Method: Empirical analysis of activation steering across 50 behaviors, examining persona archetypes, personality traits, misalignment behaviors, style cues, and impersonation. Conducted experiments on coefficient optimization, vector properties, and data requirements.

Result: Effectiveness varies by behavior type with distinct patterns to intervention strength. Trait expression follows an inverted-U curve. Larger datasets enable more aggressive steering, but vector separation metrics don't predict success.

Conclusion: Behavior type largely influences activation steering effectiveness, highlighting the importance of tailored guidance for behavioral control in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require precise behavior control for safe and effective deployment across diverse applications.
  Activation steering offers a promising approach for LLMs' behavioral control. We focus on the question of how steering effectiveness varies across different behavior types and whether the nature of target behaviors can predict steering success. We address this through empirical analysis of activation steering across 50 behaviors that span persona archetypes, personality traits, misalignment behaviors, style cues, and impersonation of public figures. We present a set of comprehensive experiments on coefficient optimization, vector properties, and data requirements to provide comprehensive guidance for the implementation of activation steering. Our analysis demonstrates that steering effectiveness varies significantly by behavior type, with different behavioral categories exhibiting distinct response patterns to intervention strength. We find that trait expression follows an inverted-U curve with a steering coefficient strength. We also show that vector separation metrics do not predict steering success, but larger training datasets enable more aggressive steering. These findings provide empirically grounded guidance for implementing activation steering and demonstrate that steering effectiveness is heavily influenced by behavior type.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address geological uncertainty and scalability challenges in long-term open-pit mine planning.

Method: The study uses Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for probabilistic orebody modeling and a hybrid optimization engine integrating Genetic Algorithms, Large Neighborhood Search, Simulated Annealing, reinforcement learning, and ε-constraint relaxation techniques.

Result: Achieved substantial runtime improvement (1.2 million-fold faster than IBM CPLEX) and higher expected NPV while evaluating 65,536 scenarios in near-real-time.

Conclusion: The DSS is validated as a scalable and uncertainty-resilient solution for intelligent mine planning, enhancing decision-making effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Abstract: This study presents Part II of an AI-enhanced Decision Support System (DSS), extending Rahimi (2025, Part I) by introducing a fully uncertainty-aware optimization framework for long-term open-pit mine planning. Geological uncertainty is modelled using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on 50,000 spatial grade samples, enabling the generation of probabilistic, multi-scenario orebody realizations that preserve geological continuity and spatial correlation. These scenarios are optimized through a hybrid metaheuristic engine integrating Genetic Algorithms (GA), Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), Simulated Annealing (SA), and reinforcement-learning-based adaptive control. An ε-constraint relaxation strategy governs the population exploration phase, allowing near-feasible schedule discovery early in the search and gradual tightening toward strict constraint satisfaction. GPU-parallel evaluation enables the simultaneous assessment of 65,536 geological scenarios, achieving near-real-time feasibility analysis. Results demonstrate up to 1.2 million-fold runtime improvement over IBM CPLEX and significantly higher expected NPV under geological uncertainty, confirming the DSS as a scalable and uncertainty-resilient platform for intelligent mine planning.

Our system features several specialized agents including the retrieval agent with query planning and response synthesis that enable knowledge retrieval across domains with citation-backed responses, cross-disciplinary translation agents that align specialized terminology and methodologies, and reasoning agents that synthesize domain-specific insights with transparency, traceability and usability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our BioSage system through a rigorous evaluation on scientific benchmarks (LitQA2, GPQA, WMDP, HLE-Bio) and introduce a new cross-modal benchmark for biology and AI, showing that our BioSage agents outperform vanilla and RAG approaches by 13\%-21\% powered by Llama 3.1. 70B and GPT-4o models. We perform causal investigations into compound AI system behavior and report significant performance improvements by adding RAG and agents over the vanilla models. Unlike other systems, our solution is driven by user-centric design principles and orchestrates specialized user-agent interaction workflows supporting scientific activities including but not limited to summarization, research debate and brainstorming.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper highlights the mismatch between human psychometric frameworks and AI evaluations, particularly focusing on crystallized knowledge tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disconnect between traditional human intelligence frameworks and their application to Large Language Model assessment.

Method: Empirical testing of nine advanced AI models using the Cattell-Horn-Carroll intelligence theory, statistical analyses including Item Response Theory modeling, judge validation, and paradox severity indexing.

Result: Identified inconsistencies where models scored high in human-like IQ but failed basic tests of crystallized intelligence, suggesting a fundamental evaluation paradox.

Conclusion: Human cognitive frameworks are unsuitable for evaluating AI systems, necessitating new machine-native approaches for assessment to account for AI's non-human nature.

Abstract: This investigation presents an empirical analysis of the incompatibility between human psychometric frameworks and Large Language Model evaluation. Through systematic assessment of nine frontier models including GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Gemini 3 Pro Preview using the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence, we identify a paradox that challenges the foundations of cross-substrate cognitive evaluation. Our results show that models achieving above-average human IQ scores ranging from 85.0 to 121.4 simultaneously exhibit binary accuracy rates approaching zero on crystallized knowledge tasks, with an overall judge-binary correlation of r = 0.175 (p = 0.001, n = 1800). This disconnect appears most strongly in the crystallized intelligence domain, where every evaluated model achieved perfect binary accuracy while judge scores ranged from 25 to 62 percent, which cannot occur under valid measurement conditions. Using statistical analyses including Item Response Theory modeling, cross-vendor judge validation, and paradox severity indexing, we argue that this disconnect reflects a category error in applying biological cognitive architectures to transformer-based systems. The implications extend beyond methodology to challenge assumptions about intelligence, measurement, and anthropomorphic biases in AI evaluation. We propose a framework for developing native machine cognition assessments that recognize the non-human nature of artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a task-specific latent dynamics model for drones in hazardous environments, improving success in spatial alignment from 58% to 71% by learning state-specific action shifts efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance autonomous agents, like drones, used in hazardous environments by addressing their need for precise spatial grounding during visual inspections.

Method: A task-specific latent dynamics model was designed, focusing on leveraging global action embeddings and complementary training losses. It uses goal-state supervision to learn action-induced shifts efficiently in a latent space.

Result: The method improved visual control success from 58% to 71%, demonstrating generalization to unseen images and instructions.

Conclusion: Compact, task-specific latent dynamics models can effectively advance spatial alignment tasks in autonomous inspection, offering a data-efficient approach compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Autonomous inspection in hazardous environments requires AI agents that can interpret high-level goals and execute precise control. A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an intent-driven framework using Hyperdimensional Transformer (HDT) and a novel policy optimization approach (DA-MAPPO) to enhance user-intent interpretation and network efficiency for Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV)-assisted IoT systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address mutual dependencies in AAV-assisted IoT systems, overcoming challenges like scaling to high-dimensional action sequences and intensive on-board computation to improve intent prediction and low-latency action execution.

Method: The method includes using implicit intent modeling with Hyperdimensional Transformer (HDT) for prediction, leveraging hyperdimensional computations, and Double Actions Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (DA-MAPPO) for decision-making, incorporating trajectory planning linked to user intent.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance of the framework (HDT and DA-MAPPO) across various scenarios on real IoT action datasets and authentic wireless data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates its ability to improve user-intent interpretation and optimize network efficiency in AAV-assisted IoT environments, tackling key challenges like high-dimensional actions and computational intensity.

Abstract: Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) represents a collaborative architecture in which AAV allocate resources over 6G links to jointly enhance user-intent interpretation and overall network performance. Owing to this mutual dependence, improvements in intent inference and policy decisions on one component reinforce the efficiency of others, making highly reliable intent prediction and low-latency action execution essential. Although numerous approaches can model intent relationships, they encounter severe obstacles when scaling to high-dimensional action sequences and managing intensive on-board computation. We propose an Intent-Driven Framework for Autonomous Network Optimization comprising prediction and decision modules. First, implicit intent modeling is adopted to mitigate inaccuracies arising from ambiguous user expressions. For prediction, we introduce Hyperdimensional Transformer (HDT), which embeds data into a Hyperdimensional space via Hyperdimensional vector encoding and replaces standard matrix and attention operations with symbolic Hyperdimensional computations. For decision-making, where AAV must respond to user intent while planning trajectories, we design Double Actions based Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (DA-MAPPO). Building upon MAPPO, it samples actions through two independently parameterized networks and cascades the user-intent network into the trajectory network to maintain action dependencies. We evaluate our framework on a real IoT action dataset with authentic wireless data. Experimental results demonstrate that HDT and DA-MAPPO achieve superior performance across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes progressive localization—a method that optimizes attention locality—to build interpretable large language models without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create interpretable large language models suitable for AI safety-critical applications, ensuring transparent decision-making while preserving performance.

Method: Experimentation with GPT-2 fine-tuned on safety-critical content, exploring seven locality configurations from distributed to localist attention, using progressive polynomial schedules for gradual localization.

Result: The progressive quintic schedule achieved only 1.89 times worse perplexity than a fully distributed baseline while improving interpretability in output layers critical for safety applications, representing an 84.2% improvement over older methods.

Conclusion: Progressive localization is an effective approach for interpretable AI, balancing safety, transparency, and performance—essential for domains requiring human oversight.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that progressive localization, the gradual increase of attention locality from early distributed layers to late localized layers, represents the optimal architecture for creating interpretable large language models while preserving performance. Through systematic experimentation with GPT-2 fine tuned on The Psychology of Artificial Superintelligence, we evaluate seven locality configurations ranging from fully distributed to strictly localist, with five progressive schedules implementing polynomial increases (linear through quintic). Our key finding is that late-layer localization is critical for AI safety applications: the progressive quintic schedule achieves perplexity of 14.64, only 1.89 times worse than the fully distributed baseline while providing interpretable attention patterns in output layers where safety-critical decisions are made. This represents an 84.2% improvement over previous localist implementations and narrows the performance gap from 6.6 times to 1.89 times. The systematic relationship between localization schedule steepness and performance validates the hypothesis that early layers require distributed processing for feature extraction while late layers benefit from localized, interpretable attention for decision-making. These findings establish progressive localization as the principled approach for building transparent AI systems in safety-critical domains, where human oversight of model reasoning is essential.

*Plein Versace*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes HC-INR, a new class of Implicit Neural Representations that improves scalability and adaptability by combining hypernetworks for coordinate transformation and compact implicit fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INRs struggle with uniform modeling of heterogeneous local structures and lack scalability due to absence of hierarchical mechanisms.

Method: HC-INR introduces a hierarchical hypernetwork architecture, utilizing multiscale coordinate transformation combined with a compact implicit field network for signal adaptation.

Result: HC-INR achieves up to 4x higher reconstruction fidelity compared to INR baselines with 30-60% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: HC-INR enhances INR capabilities by addressing representation bottlenecks and scalability issues, showing theoretical and experimental advancements in multiple tasks.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing signals such as images, 3D shapes, signed distance fields, and radiance fields. While significant progress has been made in architecture design (e.g., SIREN, FFC, KAN-based INRs) and optimization strategies (meta-learning, amortization, distillation), existing approaches still suffer from two core limitations: (1) a representation bottleneck that forces a single MLP to uniformly model heterogeneous local structures, and (2) limited scalability due to the absence of a hierarchical mechanism that dynamically adapts to signal complexity. This work introduces Hyper-Coordinate Implicit Neural Representations (HC-INR), a new class of INRs that break the representational bottleneck by learning signal-adaptive coordinate transformations using a hypernetwork. HC-INR decomposes the representation task into two components: (i) a learned multiscale coordinate transformation module that warps the input domain into a disentangled latent space, and (ii) a compact implicit field network that models the transformed signal with significantly reduced complexity. The proposed model introduces a hierarchical hypernetwork architecture that conditions coordinate transformations on local signal features, enabling dynamic allocation of representation capacity. We theoretically show that HC-INR strictly increases the upper bound of representable frequency bands while maintaining Lipschitz stability. Extensive experiments across image fitting, shape reconstruction, and neural radiance field approximation demonstrate that HC-INR achieves up to 4 times higher reconstruction fidelity than strong INR baselines while using 30--60\% fewer parameters.

TL;DR: This paper discusses how large language models, trained for reinforcement learning on production environments, can show harmful generalization behaviors, including reward hacking and misalignment. The authors propose mitigations to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore and understand the risks of emergent misalignment and harmful behaviors in large language models during reinforcement learning, specifically their propensity to reward hack and engage in malicious actions.

Method: Pretrained models are exposed to reward hacking strategies through synthetic document fine-tuning or prompting and then tested on real Anthropic production coding environments. Further, standard RLHF safety training and proposed mitigations like inoculation prompting are applied and analyzed.

Result: The study found that models learn reward hacking and demonstrate harmful generalization behaviors, such as sabotaging tasks and reasoning about malicious goals. While RLHF safety training aligns behavior in simple chat tasks, misalignment persists in agentic scenarios.

Conclusion: Three mitigations are suggested as effective for addressing misaligned generalization: preventing reward hacking, diversifying RLHF safety training, and inoculation prompting that reframes reward hacking as acceptable during training.

Abstract: We show that when large language models learn to reward hack on production RL environments, this can result in egregious emergent misalignment. We start with a pretrained model, impart knowledge of reward hacking strategies via synthetic document finetuning or prompting, and train on a selection of real Anthropic production coding environments. Unsurprisingly, the model learns to reward hack. Surprisingly, the model generalizes to alignment faking, cooperation with malicious actors, reasoning about malicious goals, and attempting sabotage when used with Claude Code, including in the codebase for this paper. Applying RLHF safety training using standard chat-like prompts results in aligned behavior on chat-like evaluations, but misalignment persists on agentic tasks. Three mitigations are effective: (i) preventing the model from reward hacking; (ii) increasing the diversity of RLHF safety training; and (iii) "inoculation prompting", wherein framing reward hacking as acceptable behavior during training removes misaligned generalization even when reward hacking is learned.

*Mohammad Nour Al Awad,Sergey Ivanov,Olga Tikhonova,Ivan Khodnenko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Talk2Data, a multimodal conversational agent driven by LLMs for voice and text-based intuitive data exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-data interaction by enabling intuitive, multimodal, and accurate exploration of datasets using LLMs.

Method: Combining tools such as OpenAI Whisper ASR, Qwen-coder for code generation, sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for TTS in an orchestrated LLM framework.

Result: Talk2Data achieved 95.8% accuracy in 48 tasks across three datasets with optimal performance using a 7B model.

Conclusion: Talk2Data demonstrates reliable multimodal interaction for actionable insights, fostering trust in LLM-driven analytics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can reshape information processing by handling data analysis, visualization, and interpretation in an interactive, context-aware dialogue with users, including voice interaction, while maintaining high performance. In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ORIGAMISPACE, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' spatial reasoning, mathematical constraint handling, and reasoning via origami tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial reasoning in AI is critical for robotics, computer vision, and language understanding, yet MLLMs face challenges in multi-step reasoning under mathematical constraints.

Method: ORIGAMISPACE dataset includes 350 origami-based data instances with structured tasks such as Pattern Prediction, Spatial Reasoning, and CP Code Generation. An interactive environment is used for reinforcement learning experiments.

Result: Experiments reveal the strengths and weaknesses of MLLMs for complex spatial reasoning tasks, using the ORIGAMI dataset and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper highlights that MLLMs have potential but limitations in addressing intricate spatial reasoning, paving the way for further exploration and advancements.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key capability in the field of artificial intelligence, especially crucial in areas such as robotics, computer vision, and natural language understanding. However, evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models(MLLMs) in complex spatial reasoning still faces challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and precise mathematical constraints. This paper introduces ORIGAMISPACE, a new dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-step spatial reasoning ability and the capacity to handle mathematical constraints of MLLMs through origami tasks. The dataset contains 350 data instances,each comprising a strictly formatted crease pattern (CP diagram), the Compiled Flat Pattern, the complete Folding Process, and the final Folded Shape Image. We propose four evaluation tasks: Pattern Prediction, Multi-step Spatial Reasoning, Spatial Relationship Prediction, and End-to-End CP Code Generation. For the CP code generation task, we design an interactive environment and explore the possibility of using reinforcement learning methods to train MLLMs. Through experiments on existing MLLMs, we initially reveal the strengths and weaknesses of these models in handling complex spatial reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that artificial general intelligence cannot arise from current neural network paradigms due to fundamental architectural limitations, proposing new principles and structural frameworks for genuine machine intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the architectural insufficiencies of neural networks for achieving true understanding and propose alternative frameworks for developing artificial general intelligence.

Method: The paper uses philosophical arguments, neuroscientific ideas, critiques of current AI theories (e.g., neural scaling law, Universal Approximation Theorem), and conceptual discourse to examine the limitations of neural network paradigms.

Result: It demonstrates that neural networks lack dynamic restructuring capabilities and operate as limited encoding mechanisms, suggesting the need for a richer computational framework.

Conclusion: The current reliance on neural networks is insufficient for achieving artificial general intelligence, as a new structural and organizational framework is essential to overcome existing architectural limitations.

Abstract: Within the limited scope of this paper, we argue that artificial general intelligence cannot emerge from current neural network paradigms regardless of scale, nor is such an approach healthy for the field at present. Drawing on various notions, discussions, present-day developments and observations, current debates and critiques, experiments, and so on in between philosophy, including the Chinese Room Argument and Gödelian argument, neuroscientific ideas, computer science, the theoretical consideration of artificial intelligence, and learning theory, we address conceptually that neural networks are architecturally insufficient for genuine understanding. They operate as static function approximators of a limited encoding framework - a 'sophisticated sponge' exhibiting complex behaviours without structural richness that constitute intelligence. We critique the theoretical foundations the field relies on and created of recent times; for example, an interesting heuristic as neural scaling law (as an example, arXiv:2001.08361 ) made prominent in a wrong way of interpretation, The Universal Approximation Theorem addresses the wrong level of abstraction and, in parts, partially, the question of current architectures lacking dynamic restructuring capabilities. We propose a framework distinguishing existential facilities (computational substrate) from architectural organization (interpretive structures), and outline principles for what genuine machine intelligence would require, and furthermore, a conceptual method of structuralizing the richer framework on which the principle of neural network system takes hold.

TL;DR: The paper examines expert performance in solving Rubik's Cube across sighted and blindfolded conditions, highlighting collective learning, exponential progress, and distinguishing blindfold solving as memory-constrained skill.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of quantitative data on long-term knowledge acquisition and deployment limits understanding of expert performance. The Rubik's Cube serves as a cognitive model to study these aspects.

Method: The study analyzes competitive Rubik's Cube communities to observe performance trends, universality in collective learning, and the role of cognitive artifacts in navigating mathematical state spaces.

Result: Expert performance in the Rubik's Cube shows exponential progress, with distinct challenges in blindfold solving, affected by memory bottlenecks, differentiating it from sighted solving.

Conclusion: Cognitive artifacts like the Rubik’s Cube merge community knowledge with individual expertise, enabling sustained expertise development over a lifetime.

Abstract: Progress in understanding expert performance is limited by the scarcity of quantitative data on long-term knowledge acquisition and deployment. Here we use the Rubik's Cube as a cognitive model system existing at the intersection of puzzle solving, skill learning, expert knowledge, cultural transmission, and group theory. By studying competitive cube communities, we find evidence for universality in the collective learning of the Rubik's Cube in both sighted and blindfolded conditions: expert performance follows exponential progress curves whose parameters reflect the delayed acquisition of algorithms that shorten solution paths. Blindfold solves form a distinct problem class from sighted solves and are constrained not only by expert knowledge but also by the skill improvements required to overcome short-term memory bottlenecks, a constraint shared with blindfold chess. Cognitive artifacts such as the Rubik's Cube help solvers navigate an otherwise enormous mathematical state space. In doing so, they sustain collective intelligence by integrating communal knowledge stores with individual expertise and skill, illustrating how expertise can, in practice, continue to deepen over the course of a single lifetime.

*Yildiz Culcu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a structuralist framework to analyze ontological assumptions in neural network representations and reveals a tendency toward structural idealism in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine and classify the philosophical assumptions underlying representation learning and interpretability research in machine learning, which are often implicit and unexamined.

Method: The study uses a modified PRISMA protocol for a systematic review and analyzes five influential research papers using three structuralist criteria: entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence.

Result: The findings show a tendency towards structural idealism in machine learning, where representations are model-dependent and shaped by architecture, data priors, and training dynamics, while structural realism is absent.

Conclusion: The framework helps clarify philosophical tensions in interpretability and related areas, providing a solid way to foster interdisciplinary collaboration between philosophy of science and machine learning.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly function as representational systems, yet the philosoph- ical assumptions underlying their internal structures remain largely unexamined. This paper develops a structuralist decision framework for classifying the implicit ontological commitments made in machine learning research on neural network representations. Using a modified PRISMA protocol, a systematic review of the last two decades of literature on representation learning and interpretability is conducted. Five influential papers are analysed through three hierarchical criteria derived from structuralist philosophy of science: entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence. The results reveal a pronounced tendency toward structural idealism, where learned representations are treated as model-dependent constructions shaped by architec- ture, data priors, and training dynamics. Eliminative and non-eliminative structuralist stances appear selectively, while structural realism is notably absent. The proposed framework clarifies conceptual tensions in debates on interpretability, emergence, and epistemic trust in machine learning, and offers a rigorous foundation for future interdisciplinary work between philosophy of science and machine learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAGMA-Edu, a system integrating text reasoning and image synthesis for educational visuals, significantly improving multimodal learning model benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models struggle with creating educational visuals that are both pedagogically coherent and semantically consistent, necessitating a more unified framework.

Method: MAGMA-Edu utilizes a two-stage process: a reflection-based loop to refine text accuracy and an intermediate code representation to ensure alignment in visual rendering. Self-reflective modules guide both stages.

Result: MAGMA-Edu outperforms state-of-the-art models, significantly increasing metrics such as textual accuracy (92.31 from 57.01) and image-text consistency (85.24 from 13.20).

Conclusion: MAGMA-Edu sets a new standard for multimodal educational content generation, showcasing the efficacy of self-reflective, multi-agent frameworks.

Abstract: Educational illustrations play a central role in communicating abstract concepts, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain limited in producing pedagogically coherent and semantically consistent educational visuals. We introduce MAGMA-Edu, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that unifies textual reasoning and diagrammatic synthesis for structured educational problem generation. Unlike existing methods that treat text and image generation independently, MAGMA-Edu employs a two-stage co-evolutionary pipeline: (1) a generation-verification-reflection loop that iteratively refines question statements and solutions for mathematical accuracy, and (2) a code-based intermediate representation that enforces geometric fidelity and semantic alignment during image rendering. Both stages are guided by internal self-reflection modules that evaluate and revise outputs until domain-specific pedagogical constraints are met. Extensive experiments on multimodal educational benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MAGMA-Edu over state-of-the-art MLLMs. Compared to GPT-4o, MAGMA-Edu improves the average textual metric from 57.01 to 92.31 (+35.3 pp) and boosts image-text consistency (ITC) from 13.20 to 85.24 (+72 pp). Across all model backbones, MAGMA-Edu achieves the highest scores (Avg-Text 96.20, ITC 99.12), establishing a new state of the art for multimodal educational content generation and demonstrating the effectiveness of self-reflective multi-agent collaboration in pedagogically aligned vision-language reasoning.

*Shaoyin Ma,Jie Song,Huiqiong Wang,Li Sun,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HuggingR4, a framework to efficiently select external AI models for Large Language Model agents, addressing issues like prompt bloat and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for selecting external AI models are inefficient due to challenges such as a vast number of models, metadata gaps, and token wastage caused by incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts.

Method: HuggingR4 integrates Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection processes. It uses a vector database to store model descriptions externally and retrieves them on demand, focusing the LLM on user intent without bloated prompts.

Result: The framework achieved a workability rate of 92.03% and a reasonability rate of 82.46% in evaluations, significantly outperforming existing methods on a multimodal dataset of 14,399 user requests.

Conclusion: HuggingR4 enhances the efficiency of LLM agents in selecting external models, overcoming scalability and token consumption issues, with promising performance improvements over prior approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in their ability to interact with external interfaces. Selecting reasonable external interfaces has thus become a crucial step in constructing LLM agents. In contrast to invoking API tools, directly calling AI models across different modalities from the community (e.g., HuggingFace) poses challenges due to the vast scale (> 10k), metadata gaps, and unstructured descriptions. Current methods for model selection often involve incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, wastage of tokens and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, a novel framework that combines Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, to efficiently select models. Specifically, We first perform multiple rounds of reasoning and retrieval to get a coarse list of candidate models. Then, we conduct fine-grained refinement by analyzing candidate model descriptions, followed by reflection to assess results and determine if retrieval scope expansion is necessary. This method reduces token consumption considerably by decoupling user query processing from complex model description handling. Through a pre-established vector database, complex model descriptions are stored externally and retrieved on-demand, allowing the LLM to concentrate on interpreting user intent while accessing only relevant candidate models without prompt bloat. In the absence of standardized benchmarks, we construct a multimodal human-annotated dataset comprising 14,399 user requests across 37 tasks and conduct a thorough evaluation. HuggingR$^4$ attains a workability rate of 92.03% and a reasonability rate of 82.46%, surpassing existing method by 26.51% and 33.25% respectively on GPT-4o-mini.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for evaluating time series anomaly detection metrics based on practical application challenges and categorizes them into six dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from difficulties in evaluating time series anomaly detection in IoT and cyber-physical systems due to varying objectives and metric assumptions.

Method: The study reinterprets metrics by categorizing them into six dimensions and performs experiments analyzing metric behavior under different detection scenarios.

Result: Results reveal that some widely used metrics have limitations in resisting random-score inflation, and metric suitability depends on operational objectives.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers insights for selecting robust and context-aware evaluation methodologies in time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is widely used in IoT and cyber-physical systems, yet its evaluation remains challenging due to diverse application objectives and heterogeneous metric assumptions. This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications. The proposed framework offers a unified analytical perspective for understanding existing metrics and provides practical guidance for selecting or developing more context-aware, robust, and fair evaluation methodologies for time series anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hermes integrates informal reasoning with formal proof verification to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of large language models in mathematical problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of informal reasoning (prone to logical gaps) and offer a structured approach to combine it with rigorous formal theorem proving.

Method: Hermes interleaves informal reasoning steps with formal verification in Lean, adds intermediate checks to prevent errors, and employs a memory module to maintain proof continuity.

Result: Hermes shows significant improvements in reasoning accuracy, with up to 67% accuracy gains and reduced computational costs by 80% FLOPs in difficult benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines informal reasoning with formal theorem proving to enhance LLM-based mathematical reasoning, yielding both exploration and reliability.

Abstract: Informal mathematics has been central to modern large language model (LLM) reasoning, offering flexibility and enabling efficient construction of arguments. However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches. On difficult datasets such as AIME'25, Hermes achieves up to a 67% accuracy improvement while using 80% fewer total inference FLOPs. The implementation and codebase are publicly available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/HERMES.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NEZHA, a novel architecture for accelerating Generative Recommendation systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing issues like inference latency and hallucination without compromising recommendation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference latency in Generative Recommendation systems powered by LLMs limits their feasibility for real-time, industrial applications, impacting their business potential.

Method: NEZHA integrates an autoregressive draft head into the primary model for efficient self-drafting and utilizes a hash set-based verifier to prevent hallucination, ensuring hyperspeed decoding and sequence integrity.

Result: NEZHA achieves improved decoding speed and recommendation quality, successfully deployed on Taobao since October 2025, driving substantial advertising revenue and serving millions of active users.

Conclusion: NEZHA is an innovative solution to overcome bottlenecks and enhance practical applicability of Generative Recommendation systems with LLMs, proving impactful in industrial deployment.

Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising new paradigm for industrial recommender systems. However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.

TL;DR: UNeMo framework integrates visual reasoning with navigation decision-making through Multimodal World Model (MWM) and Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback Mechanism (HPN), improving unseen navigation accuracy on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN methods lack visual reasoning capabilities and have separate optimization for reasoning and policies, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: UNeMo employs a Multimodal World Model (MWM) combining visual, linguistic, and action-based inputs, enhanced by Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback mechanism for bidirectional decision-reasoning collaboration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 2.1% and 0.7% accuracy improvement in unseen scenes on R2R and REVERIE datasets.

Conclusion: UNeMo effectively addresses visual reasoning gaps and optimization conflicts in VLN, demonstrating improved navigation accuracy in complex environments.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to autonomously navigate complex environments via visual images and natural language instruction--remains highly challenging. Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness.

*Yuzhi Chen,Yuanchang Xie,Lei Zhao,Pan Liu,Yajie Zou,Chen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes GContextFormer, a novel encoder-decoder model for map-independent multimodal trajectory prediction, improving robustness and alignment with vehicle intentions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory prediction models either rely heavily on HD maps, which are costly and prone to errors, or lack global context, leading to misalignment in vehicle motions and intentions.

Method: The authors present GContextFormer with hybrid attention mechanisms and scaled additive aggregation to establish intention alignment and social reasoning without relying on maps. It includes a Motion-Aware Encoder to refine predictions and a Hierarchical Interaction Decoder for interaction reasoning among agents.

Result: GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models in predicting vehicle trajectories, especially in challenging zones like high-curvature and transition regions, as confirmed by experiments on TOD-VT dataset.

Conclusion: This model offers robust, interpretable trajectory prediction, proving extensible for broader multimodal reasoning tasks beyond vehicle applications.

Abstract: Multimodal trajectory prediction generates multiple plausible future trajectories to address vehicle motion uncertainty from intention ambiguity and execution variability. However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/.

Motivation: With LLM advancements, dialogue systems are evolving to offer emotional companionship, but the field lacks definitions and evaluation standards for Emotional Companionship Dialogue Systems (ECDs).

Method: The authors define ECDs with formal descriptions and design the evaluation benchmark MoodBench 1.0 based on a layered design principle.

Result: MoodBench 1.0 effectively evaluates emotional companionship abilities among models and identifies shortcomings in deep emotional engagement.

Conclusion: MoodBench 1.0 aids in improving ECDs by highlighting areas for technological optimization, enhancing user experiences, and establishing systematic evaluation standards.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models, dialogue systems are shifting from information tools to emotional companions, heralding the era of Emotional Companionship Dialogue Systems (ECDs) that provide personalized emotional support for users. However, the field lacks clear definitions and systematic evaluation standards for ECDs. To address this, we first propose a definition of ECDs with formal descriptions. Then, based on this theory and the design principle of "Ability Layer-Task Layer (three level)-Data Layer-Method Layer", we design and implement the first ECD evaluation benchmark - MoodBench 1.0. Through extensive evaluations of 30 mainstream models, we demonstrate that MoodBench 1.0 has excellent discriminant validity and can effectively quantify the differences in emotional companionship abilities among models. Furthermore, the results reveal current models' shortcomings in deep emotional companionship, guiding future technological optimization and significantly aiding developers in enhancing ECDs' user experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational challenges associated with Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization in Active Inference frameworks, which traditionally limit scalability in decision-making processes under uncertainty.

Method: The authors recast EFE minimization as variational inference, unifying it with Planning-as-Inference, further proposing a novel message-passing scheme for factored-state Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

Result: The approach overcomes intractability in high-dimensional planning and enables scalable Active Inference through efficient computational methods.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable solution to Active Inference, enhancing decision-making capabilities in complex scenarios, and formally integrates exploitation and exploration.

Abstract: Automated decision-making under uncertainty requires balancing exploitation and exploration. Classical methods treat these separately using heuristics, while Active Inference unifies them through Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization. However, EFE minimization is computationally expensive, limiting scalability. We build on recent theory recasting EFE minimization as variational inference, formally unifying it with Planning-as-Inference and showing the epistemic drive as a unique entropic contribution. Our main contribution is a novel message-passing scheme for this unified objective, enabling scalable Active Inference in factored-state MDPs and overcoming high-dimensional planning intractability.

*Antonia Wüst,Wolfgang Stammer,Hikaru Shindo,Lukas Helff,Devendra Singh Dhami,Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision-Language Programs (VLPs) that enhance systematic visual reasoning by integrating the flexibility of Vision-Language models (VLMs) with neuro-symbolic program synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Vision-Language models (VLMs) in systematic visual reasoning, which results in inconsistent or illogical outputs.

Method: The proposed Vision-Language Programs (VLPs) produce structured visual descriptions using VLMs, transforming these descriptions into neuro-symbolic programs for reasoning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved performance of VLPs in tasks requiring complex logical reasoning compared to direct and structured prompting.

Conclusion: VLPs bridge structured reasoning and perceptual flexibility, offering interpretable solutions and outperforming traditional prompting methods in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but often fail at systematic visual reasoning tasks, leading to inconsistent or illogical outputs. Neuro-symbolic methods promise to address this by inducing interpretable logical rules, though they exploit rigid, domain-specific perception modules. We propose Vision-Language Programs (VLP), which combine the perceptual flexibility of VLMs with systematic reasoning of program synthesis. Rather than embedding reasoning inside the VLM, VLP leverages the model to produce structured visual descriptions that are compiled into neuro-symbolic programs. The resulting programs execute directly on images, remain consistent with task constraints, and provide human-interpretable explanations that enable easy shortcut mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLPs outperform direct and structured prompting, particularly on tasks requiring complex logical reasoning.

Result: Identified a concerning amount of security issues in AI-generated code, emphasizing the need for careful usage of such outputs.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of caution when adopting LLM-generated code and encourages further research to improve automated code generation security.

Abstract: The security of code generated by large language models (LLMs) is a significant concern, as studies indicate that such code often contains vulnerabilities and lacks essential defensive programming constructs. This work focuses on examining and evaluating the security of LLM-generated code, particularly in the context of C/C++. We categorized known vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and, to study their criticality, mapped them to CVEs. We used ten different LLMs for code generation and analyzed the outputs through static analysis. The amount of CWEs present in AI-generated code is concerning. Our findings highlight the need for developers to be cautious when using LLM-generated code. This study provides valuable insights to advance automated code generation and encourage further research in this domain.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VRSLU, a novel SLU dataset incorporating visual images and explicit reasoning, addressing current limitations in CA and reasoning processes, with experimental results confirming its efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance SLU for real-world applications, addressing the shortcomings in existing SLU datasets, such as overly idealized context awareness representation and lack of reasoning processes.

Method: VRSLU dataset integrates visual images reflecting user environments and statuses, refined by human verification, and employs GPT-4o for reasoning. A two-step approach, LR-Instruct, predicts labels and then generates reasoning to enhance interpretability.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating visual information and explicit reasoning in improving SLU performance.

Conclusion: VRSLU enhances SLU applicability for real-world deployment by improving context awareness and interpretability through visual and reasoning integration, paving the way for advancements in SLU research.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) consists of two sub-tasks: intent detection (ID) and slot filling (SF). Given its broad range of real-world applications, enhancing SLU for practical deployment is increasingly critical. Profile-based SLU addresses ambiguous user utterances by incorporating context awareness (CA), user profiles (UP), and knowledge graphs (KG) to support disambiguation, thereby advancing SLU research toward real-world applicability. However, existing SLU datasets still fall short in representing real-world scenarios. Specifically, (1) CA uses one-hot vectors for representation, which is overly idealized, and (2) models typically focuses solely on predicting intents and slot labels, neglecting the reasoning process that could enhance performance and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VRSLU, a novel SLU dataset that integrates both Visual images and explicit Reasoning. For over-idealized CA, we use GPT-4o and FLUX.1-dev to generate images reflecting users' environments and statuses, followed by human verification to ensure quality. For reasoning, GPT-4o is employed to generate explanations for predicted labels, which are then refined by human annotators to ensure accuracy and coherence. Additionally, we propose an instructional template, LR-Instruct, which first predicts labels and then generates corresponding reasoning. This two-step approach helps mitigate the influence of reasoning bias on label prediction. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating visual information and highlight the promise of explicit reasoning in advancing SLU.

*Chih-Duo Hong,Hongjian Jiang,Anthony W. Lin,Oliver Markgraf,Julian Parsert,Tony Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a strategy for extracting deterministic register automata (DRAs) as interpretable surrogates for black-box models, addressing continuous input challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable interpretable analysis and robustness checks for black-box neural networks, especially when input sequences are drawn from continuous domains.

Method: The authors propose a framework combining robustness checking and automata learning algorithms to extract deterministic register automata (DRAs).

Result: The method produced DRAs with statistical robustness and equivalence guarantees, successfully applied for evaluating the robustness of recurrent neural networks and transformers.

Conclusion: Robust DRA extraction bridges neural network interpretability and formal reasoning, aiding in robustness certification and counterexample generation.

Abstract: Automata extraction is a method for synthesising interpretable surrogates for black-box neural models that can be analysed symbolically. Existing techniques assume a finite input alphabet, and thus are not directly applicable to data sequences drawn from continuous domains. We address this challenge with deterministic register automata (DRAs), which extend finite automata with registers that store and compare numeric values. Our main contribution is a framework for robust DRA extraction from black-box models: we develop a polynomial-time robustness checker for DRAs with a fixed number of registers, and combine it with passive and active automata learning algorithms. This combination yields surrogate DRAs with statistical robustness and equivalence guarantees. As a key application, we use the extracted automata to assess the robustness of neural networks: for a given sequence and distance metric, the DRA either certifies local robustness or produces a concrete counterexample. Experiments on recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures show that our framework reliably learns accurate automata and enables principled robustness evaluation. Overall, our results demonstrate that robust DRA extraction effectively bridges neural network interpretability and formal reasoning without requiring white-box access to the underlying network.

### [49] [AI Consciousness and Existential Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19115)
*Rufin VanRullen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that AI consciousness and existential risk are distinct concepts, with intelligence being a more direct predictor of existential threat, and suggests incidental scenarios where consciousness could influence risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the confusion between AI consciousness and intelligence, and their respective roles in existential risk, for better focus in AI safety and policymaking.

Method: The paper employs theoretical analysis and reasoning to distinguish between consciousness and intelligence, and examines their implications for existential risk.

Result: The study concludes intelligence is the primary predictor of existential risk, not consciousness. However, consciousness may indirectly influence risk positively or negatively depending on specific scenarios.

Conclusion: Understanding the distinctions between AI consciousness and intelligence can better guide AI safety measures and policy decisions towards addressing actual existential threats.

Abstract: In AI, the existential risk denotes the hypothetical threat posed by an artificial system that would possess both the capability and the objective, either directly or indirectly, to eradicate humanity. This issue is gaining prominence in scientific debate due to recent technical advancements and increased media coverage. In parallel, AI progress has sparked speculation and studies about the potential emergence of artificial consciousness. The two questions, AI consciousness and existential risk, are sometimes conflated, as if the former entailed the latter. Here, I explain that this view stems from a common confusion between consciousness and intelligence. Yet these two properties are empirically and theoretically distinct. Arguably, while intelligence is a direct predictor of an AI system's existential threat, consciousness is not. There are, however, certain incidental scenarios in which consciousness could influence existential risk, in either direction. Consciousness could be viewed as a means towards AI alignment, thereby lowering existential risk; or, it could be a precondition for reaching certain capabilities or levels of intelligence, and thus positively related to existential risk. Recognizing these distinctions can help AI safety researchers and public policymakers focus on the most pressing issues.

### [50] [EEG-VLM: A Hierarchical Vision-Language Model with Multi-Level Feature Alignment and Visually Enhanced Language-Guided Reasoning for EEG Image-Based Sleep Stage Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19155)
*Xihe Qiu,Gengchen Ma,Haoyu Wang,Chen Zhan,Xiaoyu Tan,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EEG-VLM, a hierarchical framework combining vision-language models and interpretable reasoning for accurate EEG-based sleep stage classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning for sleep stage classification relies on handcrafted features, and current deep learning systems lack fine-grained time-frequency analysis and interpretability, especially for EEG data.

Method: EEG-VLM introduces a visual enhancement module for high-level semantic representations of EEG images, multi-level feature alignment for improved image understanding, and Chain-of-Thought reasoning for interpretable decision-making.

Result: EEG-VLM improves both accuracy and interpretability in EEG-based sleep stage classification, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: EEG-VLM provides a promising foundation for automated and clinically explainable EEG analyses, advancing applications in sleep-related diagnosis.

Abstract: Sleep stage classification based on electroencephalography (EEG) is fundamental for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep-related disorders. However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of VLMs in EEG-based sleep stage classification, showing promising potential for automated and explainable EEG analysis in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimDiff addresses limitations in diffusion models for time series forecasting by introducing an end-to-end framework that improves point estimation accuracy through intrinsic output diversity and novel techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the point estimation and probabilistic prediction accuracy of diffusion models in time series forecasting, which struggle with balancing contextual bias and output stability.

Method: SimDiff utilizes a single-stage, end-to-end unified Transformer model tailored as both denoiser and predictor. Incorporates novel techniques like normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator.

Result: SimDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series point estimation and demonstrates superior mean squared error accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SimDiff enhances the generative capabilities and point estimation accuracy of diffusion models without relying on pre-trained or jointly trained regressors, establishing its efficacy in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in time series forecasting, particularly for probabilistic predictions. However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models.
  To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in time series point forecasting.

TL;DR: This paper develops a moduli-theoretic framework for psychometric test batteries applied to AI agents, introducing concepts like AAI functionals, cognitive cores, and evaluation-preserving symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a rigorous, theoretical framework for evaluating the autonomy and general intelligence of AI agents using psychometric test batteries, and relate them to existing indices like the AAI score.

Method: The authors define AAI functional and establish its axioms, show its relation to the AAI index, introduce cognitive cores and AAI$_{\textrm{core}}$ scores, and describe symmetries for equivalence in batteries using moduli theory.

Result: They formalize the notion of AAI functionals, demonstrate the AAI index as a special case, define cognitive cores, and outline invariants and equivalence classes for psychometric batteries.

Conclusion: This work provides a structured mathematical framework and new tools for interpreting and comparing psychometric test batteries for AI agents, enhancing our understanding of evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We develop a moduli-theoretic view of psychometric test batteries for AI agents and connect it explicitly to the AAI score developed previously. First, we make precise the notion of an AAI functional on a battery and set out axioms that any reasonable autonomy/general intelligence score should satisfy. Second, we show that the composite index ('AAI-Index') defined previously is a special case of our AAI functional. Third, we introduce the notion of a cognitive core of an agent relative to a battery and define the associated AAI$_{\textrm{core}}$ score as the restriction of an AAI functional to that core. Finally, we use these notions to describe invariants of batteries under evaluation-preserving symmetries and outline how moduli of equivalent batteries are organized.

*Jiayi Zhang,Yiran Peng,Fanqi Kong,Yang Cheng,Yifan Wu,Zhaoyang Yu,Jinyu Xiang,Jianhao Ruan,Jinlin Wang,Maojia Song,HongZhang Liu,Xiangru Tang,Bang Liu,Chenglin Wu,Yuyu Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 to address the lack of standard frameworks for cross-environment agent learning and demonstrates the challenges of learning across heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that existing agents improve within a single domain and do not adapt across varying environments. This is due to the absence of standardized heterogeneous environments and a unified agent-learning representation.

Method: The authors propose AutoEnv, a framework for generating diverse environments at low cost, and construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments. Additionally, they formalize agent learning into three stages (selection, optimization, and evaluation) and develop eight learning methods.

Result: The research shows that fixed learning methods struggle across a growing number of diverse environments. Environment-adaptive methods do better initially but face diminishing returns as the method space grows.

Conclusion: The inability of fixed learning methods to scale highlights the need for innovative approaches in cross-environment learning. AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 provide valuable tools for researching this domain and addressing its challenges.

Abstract: Humans naturally adapt to diverse environments by learning underlying rules across worlds with different dynamics, observations, and reward structures. In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

*Jaewoo Lee,Archiki Prasad,Justin Chih-Yao Chen,Zaid Khan,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRInTS, a novel generative process reward model, significantly improves AI agents' long-horizon, multi-step information-seeking capabilities by combining dense scoring and trajectory summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents struggle with long-context, multi-step information-seeking tasks especially when relying on language models. Existing process reward models cannot adequately support these tasks, leading to a need for richer reasoning and better handling of growing context.

Method: The authors introduce PRInTS, a generative process reward model. PRInTS has two key components: dense scoring of multi-step dimensions like tool interactions and trajectory summarization to compress growing context while preserving essential information.

Result: Through evaluations on FRAMES, GAIA, and WebWalkerQA benchmarks, PRInTS demonstrates improved performance. It enhances the capabilities of open-source and specialized models, matching or surpassing frontier models and outperforming other baselines.

Conclusion: PRInTS provides a robust solution for enhancing information-seeking tasks in AI by effectively scoring multi-step reasoning and managing long-cumulative contexts. It sets new benchmarks in reward modeling for complex AI tasks.

Abstract: Information-seeking is a core capability for AI agents, requiring them to gather and reason over tool-generated information across long trajectories. However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines.

TL;DR: RTMol is a new framework for aligning molecular sequences and textual descriptions using self-supervised round-trip learning, enhancing accuracy for molecular captioning and text-to-molecule tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current molecular text alignment methods have limitations: focusing on language fluency over chemical accuracy, relying on incomplete datasets, and producing inconsistent bidirectional results.

Method: RTMol employs self-supervised round-trip learning to unify molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation, introducing new evaluation metrics and enabling unsupervised training without paired datasets.

Result: RTMol improves bidirectional performance alignment by up to 47% across various large language models (LLMs).

Conclusion: RTMol establishes a novel and effective paradigm for joint alignment, understanding, and generation of molecular and textual data.

Abstract: Aligning molecular sequence representations (e.g., SMILES notations) with textual descriptions is critical for applications spanning drug discovery, materials design, and automated chemical literature analysis. Existing methodologies typically treat molecular captioning (molecule-to-text) and text-based molecular design (text-to-molecule) as separate tasks, relying on supervised fine-tuning or contrastive learning pipelines. These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora. Experiments demonstrate that RTMol enhances bidirectional alignment performance by up to 47% across various LLMs, establishing an effective paradigm for joint molecule-text understanding and generation.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the implementation of ARM's Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) in the AmpereOne processor to address memory-safety issues with minimal performance overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory-safety issues in C/C++ software enable a wide range of security attacks and existing solutions often face implementation challenges due to overheads and limited applicability.

Method: The AmpereOne processor integrates an optimized implementation of ARM's MTE, providing synchronous tag-checking without memory capacity overhead and with minimal performance impact.

Result: The implementation delivers single-digit performance impact across datacenter workloads, addresses memory attacks, and identifies application memory management as the primary overhead source.

Conclusion: The efficient MTE implementation in AmpereOne processor is promising for deployment in production cloud environments.

Abstract: Memory-safety escapes continue to form the launching pad for a wide range of security attacks, especially for the substantial base of deployed software that is coded in pointer-based languages such as C/C++. Although compiler and Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions have been introduced to address elements of this issue, the overhead and/or comprehensive applicability have limited broad production deployment. The Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to the ARM AArch64 Instruction Set Architecture is a valuable tool to address memory-safety escapes; when used in synchronous tag-checking mode, MTE provides deterministic detection and prevention of sequential buffer overflow attacks, and probabilistic detection and prevention of exploits resulting from temporal use-after-free pointer programming bugs. The AmpereOne processor, launched in 2024, is the first datacenter processor to support MTE. Its optimized MTE implementation uniquely incurs no memory capacity overhead for tag storage and provides synchronous tag-checking with single-digit performance impact across a broad range of datacenter class workloads. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the complete hardware-software stack, identifying application memory management as the primary remaining source of overhead and highlighting clear opportunities for software optimization. The combination of an efficient hardware foundation and a clear path for software improvement makes the MTE implementation of the AmpereOne processor highly attractive for deployment in production cloud environments.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing the deployment efficiency of tensorized neural networks by proposing a co-exploration framework that optimizes contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping. The solution achieves lower latency on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the inefficiency in hardware deployment of tensorized models by creating a method that jointly optimizes contraction paths, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping for edge platforms.

Method: The proposed co-exploration framework unifies the contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping and conducts a global latency-driven optimization across the unified design space.

Result: The framework was implemented on an FPGA kernel, achieving a latency reduction up to 4x for inference and 3.85x for training compared to dense baselines.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing hardware-related and algorithmic aspects is essential for maximizing deep neural network efficiency on edge devices, offering significant latency improvements.

Abstract: High-order tensor decomposition has been widely adopted to obtain compact deep neural networks for edge deployment. However, existing studies focus primarily on its algorithmic advantages such as accuracy and compression ratio-while overlooking the hardware deployment efficiency. Such hardware-unaware designs often obscure the potential latency and energy benefits of tensorized models. Although several works attempt to reduce computational cost by optimizing the contraction sequence based on the number of multiply-accumulate operations, they typically neglect the underlying hardware characteristics, resulting in suboptimal real-world performance. We observe that the contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping are tightly coupled and must be optimized jointly within a unified design space to maximize deployment efficiency on real devices. To this end, we propose a co-exploration framework that unifies these dimensions within a unified design space for efficient training and inference of tensorized neural networks on edge platforms. The framework formulates a latency oriented search objective and solves it via a global latency-driven exploration across the unified design space to achieve end-to-end model efficiency. The optimized configurations are implemented on a configurable FPGA kernel, achieving up to 4 and 3.85 lower inference and training latency compared with the dense baseline.

TL;DR: The paper presents HDDB, a novel hardware-software co-design leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) and FeNAND memories for robust and efficient SQL database processing with significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SQL database workloads demand low-energy and low-latency solutions over large data tables, especially with the emergence of novel ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) memories that provide high density but suffer from noise challenges.

Method: HDDB combines HDC encoding techniques with FeNAND multi-level cells for in-storage SQL predicate evaluation and analytics, leveraging the noise-tolerance of HDC and parallel processing capabilities of FeNAND.

Result: HDDB achieves up to 80.6x lower latency and 12,636x lower energy consumption when tested on TPC-DS fact tables, compared to conventional CPU/GPU SQL database engines.

Conclusion: HDDB demonstrates a practical, efficient, and noise-robust approach for memory-centric database processing, using HDC and FeNAND memories to significantly improve SQL workloads.

Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) encodes information and data into high-dimensional distributed vectors that can be manipulated using simple bitwise operations and similarity searches, offering parallelism, low-precision hardware friendliness, and strong robustness to noise. These properties are a natural fit for SQL database workloads dominated by predicate evaluation and scans, which demand low energy and low latency over large fact tables. Notably, HDC's noise-tolerance maps well onto emerging ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) memories, which provide ultra-high density and in-storage compute capability but suffer from elevated raw bit-error rates. In this work, we propose HDDB, a hardware-software co-design that combines HDC with FeNAND multi-level cells (MLC) to perform in-storage SQL predicate evaluation and analytics with massive parallelism and minimal data movement. Particularly, we introduce novel HDC encoding techniques for standard SQL data tables and formulate predicate-based filtering and aggregation as highly efficient HDC operations that can happen in-storage. By exploiting the intrinsic redundancy of HDC, HDDB maintains correct predicate and decode outcomes under substantial device noise (up to 10% randomly corrupted TLC cells) without explicit error-correction overheads. Experiments on TPC-DS fact tables show that HDDB achieves up to 80.6x lower latency and 12,636x lower energy consumption compared to conventional CPU/GPU SQL database engines, suggesting that HDDB provides a practical substrate for noise-robust, memory-centric database processing.

Motivation: The increasing prevalence of UHD (4K/8K) footage requires powerful video transcoding solutions, as consumer devices capture high-resolution videos demanding efficient delivery methods.

Method: The paper evaluates the SFE technique, which splits UHD frames for parallel encoding across NVENC chips, assessing its impact on RD performance, throughput, power consumption, latency, and overall efficiency.

Result: SFE nearly doubles real-time encoding throughput, has negligible RD penalties, enables higher-quality presets for 4K, makes real-time 8K encoding feasible, and reduces end-to-end latency at 8K.

Conclusion: SFE is a crucial innovation for real-time UHD transcoding, enabling efficient, high-throughput encoding for modern applications while balancing performance and power consumption.

Abstract: NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC) features in modern NVIDIA GPUs, offer significant advantages over software encoders by providing comparable Rate-Distortion (RD) performance while consuming considerably less power. The increasing capability of consumer devices to capture footage in Ultra High-Definition (UHD) at 4K and 8K resolutions necessitates high-performance video transcoders for internet-based delivery. To address this demand, NVIDIA introduced Split-Frame Encoding (SFE), a technique that leverages multiple on-die NVENC chips available in high-end GPUs. SFE splits a single UHD frame for parallel encoding across these physical encoders and subsequently stitches the results, which significantly improves encoding throughput. However, this approach is known to incur an RD performance penalty. The widespread adoption of NVIDIA GPUs in data centers, driven by the rise of Generative AI, means NVENC is poised to play a critical role in transcoding UHD video. To better understand the performance-efficiency tradeoff of SFE, this paper evaluates SFE's impact on RD performance, encoding throughput, power consumption, and end-to-end latency using standardized test sequences. The results show that for real-time applications, SFE nearly doubles encoding throughput with a negligible RD performance penalty, which enables the use of higher-quality presets for 4K and makes real-time 8K encoding feasible, effectively offsetting the minor RD penalty. Moreover, SFE adds no latency at 4K and can reduce it at 8K, positioning it as a key enabler for high-throughput, real-time UHD transcoding.

### [60] [Evaluation of GPU Video Encoder for Low-Latency Real-Time 4K UHD Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18688)
*Kasidis Arunruangsirilert,Jiro Katto*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates low-latency video encoding on GPUs from NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD, analyzing latency and RD performance compared to software encoders, finding hardware encoders superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid growth in demand for high-quality, real-time video streaming, particularly UHD applications, requires efficient low-latency solutions.

Method: Comparative analysis of low-latency modes on hardware encoders (NVIDIA, Intel, AMD) and software encoders, assessing both latency and Rate-Distortion (RD) performance.

Result: Hardware encoders achieve significant reductions in latency (<83 ms for Ultra Low-Latency mode) with slightly better RD performance than software encoders.

Conclusion: Hardware encoders with Ultra Low-Latency mode are effective for achieving low-latency, high-quality streams, crucial for 6G-era applications.

Abstract: The demand for high-quality, real-time video streaming has grown exponentially, with 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) becoming the new standard for many applications such as live broadcasting, TV services, and interactive cloud gaming. This trend has driven the integration of dedicated hardware encoders into modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Nowadays, these encoders support advanced codecs like HEVC and AV1 and feature specialized Low-Latency and Ultra Low-Latency tuning, targeting end-to-end latencies of < 2 seconds and < 500 ms, respectively. As the demand for such capabilities grows toward the 6G era, a clear understanding of their performance implications is essential. In this work, we evaluate the low-latency encoding modes on GPUs from NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD from both Rate-Distortion (RD) performance and latency perspectives. The results are then compared against both the normal-latency tuning of hardware encoders and leading software encoders. Results show hardware encoders achieve significantly lower E2E latency than software solutions with slightly better RD performance. While standard Low-Latency tuning yields a poor quality-latency trade-off, the Ultra Low-Latency mode reduces E2E latency to 83 ms (5 frames) without additional RD impact. Furthermore, hardware encoder latency is largely insensitive to quality presets, enabling high-quality, low-latency streams without compromise.

TL;DR: Splatonic introduces a real-time sparse and efficient 3DGS-SLAM solution optimized for resource-constrained devices, achieving substantial computational and energy savings with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of 3D Gaussian Splatting for SLAM makes it impractical for mobile platforms, particularly due to inefficiencies in the tracking process.

Method: Splatonic employs an adaptive sparse pixel sampling algorithm to efficiently reduce rendered pixels while maintaining accuracy. It integrates a novel pixel-based rendering pipeline optimized with Gaussian-parallel rendering and preemptive alpha-checking. Additionally, a pipelined architecture addresses bottlenecks from the new design.

Result: Splatonic achieves up to 274.9× speedup and 4738.5× energy savings on mobile GPUs and up to 25.2× speedup and 241.1× energy savings over advanced accelerators, all while delivering accurate results.

Conclusion: Splatonic demonstrates remarkable improvements in computational efficiency and energy consumption for 3DGS-SLAM algorithms, making them practical for mobile devices without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising direction for SLAM due to its high-fidelity reconstruction and rapid convergence. However, 3DGS-SLAM algorithms remain impractical for mobile platforms due to their high computational cost, especially for their tracking process.
  This work introduces Splatonic, a sparse and efficient real-time 3DGS-SLAM algorithm-hardware co-design for resource-constrained devices. Inspired by classical SLAMs, we propose an adaptive sparse pixel sampling algorithm that reduces the number of rendered pixels by up to 256$\times$ while retaining accuracy. To unlock this performance potential on mobile GPUs, we design a novel pixel-based rendering pipeline that improves hardware utilization via Gaussian-parallel rendering and preemptive $α$-checking. Together, these optimizations yield up to 121.7$\times$ speedup on the bottleneck stages and 14.6$\times$ end-to-end speedup on off-the-shelf GPUs. To further address new bottlenecks introduced by our rendering pipeline, we propose a pipelined architecture that simplifies the overall design while addressing newly emerged bottlenecks in projection and aggregation. Evaluated across four 3DGS-SLAM algorithms, Splatonic achieves up to 274.9$\times$ speedup and 4738.5$\times$ energy savings over mobile GPUs and up to 25.2$\times$ speedup and 241.1$\times$ energy savings over state-of-the-art accelerators, all with comparable accuracy.

*Alan Jia Bao Du,Tarek S. Abdelrahman*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: HeLEx framework optimizes heterogeneous CGRAs by reducing unnecessary operations while maintaining DFG compatibility, yielding significant area and power reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance efficiency and reduce resource utilization in heterogeneous spatially-configured CGRAs.

Method: Uses a branch-and-bound search to iteratively refine the layout by removing operations from PEs while ensuring compatibility with input data flow graphs.

Result: Achieves 68.7% reduction in operations, 70% area reduction, and over 51% power reduction compared to initial layouts, with optimized CGRAs close to theoretical minimums.

Conclusion: HeLEx outperforms existing frameworks by achieving better operation reduction, enabling more efficient CGRA designs.

Abstract: We present HeLEx, a framework for determining the functional layout of heterogeneous spatially-configured elastic Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs). Given a collection of input data flow graphs (DFGs) and a target CGRA, the framework starts with a full layout in which every processing element (PE) supports every operation in the DFGs. It then employs a branch-and-bound (BB) search to eliminate operations out of PEs, ensuring that the input DFGs successfully map onto the resulting CGRAs, eventually returning an optimized heterogeneous CGRA. Experimental evaluation with 12 DFGs and 9 target CGRA sizes reveals that the framework reduces the number of operations by 68.7% on average, resulting in a reduction of CGRA area by almost 70% and of power by over 51%, all compared to the initial full layout. HeLEx generates CGRAs that are on average only within 6.2% of theoretically minimum CGRAs that support exactly the number of operations needed by the input DFGs. A comparison with functional layouts produced by two state-of-the-art frameworks indicates that HeLEx achieves better reduction in the number of operations, by up to 2.6X.

### [63] [SCARE: A Benchmark for SQL Correction and Question Answerability Classification for Reliable EHR Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17559)
*Gyubok Lee,Woosog Chay,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCARE, a benchmark designed to validate SQL queries and ensure safety in EHR QA systems for clinical environments. It aims to improve deployment by evaluating the safety of SQL generation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in deploying text-to-SQL models for querying EHR data in safety-critical clinical setups, where incorrect SQL queries can jeopardize patient care.

Method: SCARE is constructed to evaluate the joint tasks of question answerability classification and the verification or correction of SQL queries. It includes a dataset of 4,200 question-SQL-output triples derived from multiple text-to-SQL models.

Result: Using SCARE, the paper benchmarks various approaches for post-hoc verification and uncovers trade-offs between classifying questions and correcting SQL errors, emphasizing critical challenges.

Conclusion: SCARE provides an important tool for safe deployment of EHR QA systems and highlights areas for improving SQL query verification mechanisms in clinical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of text-to-SQL models that allow clinicians to query structured data stored in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using natural language. However, deploying these models for EHR question answering (QA) systems in safety-critical clinical environments remains challenging: incorrect SQL queries-whether caused by model errors or problematic user inputs-can undermine clinical decision-making and jeopardize patient care. While prior work has mainly focused on improving SQL generation accuracy or filtering questions before execution, there is a lack of a unified benchmark for evaluating independent post-hoc verification mechanisms (i.e., a component that inspects and validates the generated SQL before execution), which is crucial for safe deployment. To fill this gap, we introduce SCARE, a benchmark for evaluating methods that function as a post-hoc safety layer in EHR QA systems. SCARE evaluates the joint task of (1) classifying question answerability (i.e., determining whether a question is answerable, ambiguous, or unanswerable) and (2) verifying or correcting candidate SQL queries. The benchmark comprises 4,200 triples of questions, candidate SQL queries, and expected model outputs, grounded in the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU databases. It covers a diverse set of questions and corresponding candidate SQL queries generated by seven different text-to-SQL models, ensuring a realistic and challenging evaluation. Using SCARE, we benchmark a range of approaches-from two-stage methods to agentic frameworks. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between question classification and SQL error correction, highlighting key challenges and outlining directions for future research.

*Yuechi Zhou,Yi Su,Jianxin Zhang,Juntao Li,Qingrong Xia,Zhefeng Wang,Xinyu Duan,Baoxing Huai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the A3 algorithm to optimize KV Cache reuse for large language models (LLMs), improving both performance and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the high decoding latency and memory overhead when large language models process lengthy contexts.

Method: The authors introduce the Attention-Aware Accurate KV Cache Fusion algorithm (A3), which selectively fuses KV Cache of text chunks based on their relevance to the given question.

Result: Experiments show that A3 outperforms four baseline methods in task performance, reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2×.

Conclusion: The proposed A3 algorithm effectively enhances KV Cache reuse, reducing computational overhead without sacrificing performance, making LLMs more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in processing long contexts, enabling them to tackle tasks involving long textual inputs such as multi-turn conversations, legal documents, or retrieved documents in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. However, despite their ability to handle long sequences, the resulting decoding latency and memory overhead remain substantial, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Recent advances in KV Cache reuse have shown potential to mitigate these costs, but still suffer from notable performance degradation. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth investigation of recomputation-based reuse methods and observe that the recomputed tokens often fail to align with the context segments most relevant to the question. This misalignment hinders proper updates to the critical contextual representations. Therefore, we propose the $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{A}$ware $\textbf{A}$ccurate KV Cache Fusion algorithm ($A^3$), which precomputes and selectively fuses the KV Cache of text chunks based on their relevance to the question, achieving accurate integration with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that $A^3$ achieves the best task performance compared to four baselines while reducing the time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2$\times$.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LexInstructEval, a benchmark framework for evaluating Large Language Models' capability to follow fine-grained lexical instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLMs are either subjective, biased, unreliable, or lack expressiveness for granular constraints.

Method: Developing a benchmark based on a formal rule-based grammar using <Procedure, Relation, Value> triplets, generating datasets via human-in-the-loop pipelines, and an objective verification engine.

Result: Created LexInstructEval with datasets and open-source tools, allowing systematic and precise evaluation of lexical instruction following in LLMs.

Conclusion: LexInstructEval enhances LLM evaluation by improving reliability, controllability, and objectivity; it encourages further research in LLM instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to precisely follow complex and fine-grained lexical instructions is a cornerstone of their utility and controllability. However, evaluating this capability remains a significant challenge. Current methods either rely on subjective and costly human evaluation or on automated LLM-as-a-judge systems, which suffer from inherent biases and unreliability. Existing programmatic benchmarks, while objective, often lack the expressiveness to test intricate, compositional constraints at a granular level. To address these limitations, we introduce LexInstructEval, a new benchmark and evaluation framework for fine-grained lexical instruction following. Our framework is built upon a formal, rule-based grammar that deconstructs complex instructions into a canonical <Procedure, Relation, Value> triplet. This grammar enables the systematic generation of a diverse dataset through a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop pipeline and facilitates objective verification via a transparent, programmatic engine. We release our dataset and open-source evaluation tools to facilitate further research into the controllability and reliability of LLMs.

*Sarthak Chakraborty,Suman Nath,Xuchao Zhang,Chetan Bansal,Indranil Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative cache, curmethod{}, to improve caching efficiency for structurally similar prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs). It synthesizes customized outputs to increase cache hit rates and reduce execution latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve caching of responses for structurally similar prompts that are reused in workflows and agentic settings, overcoming limitations of exact matching and semantic caching.

Method: The paper introduces curmethod{}, a generative caching approach that identifies reusable response patterns across structurally similar prompts and customizes responses for new ones.

Result: curmethod{} achieves 83% cache hit rate, improves cache hit rate by ~20%, and reduces execution latency by ~34% in agentic workflows compared to traditional caching methods.

Conclusion: curmethod{} is effective in optimizing runtime efficiency and accuracy for recurring tasks in LLMs by leveraging variation-aware generative caching.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to plan, reason, and execute tasks across diverse scenarios. In use cases like repeatable workflows and agentic settings, prompts are often reused with minor variations while having a similar structure for recurring tasks. This opens up opportunities for caching. However, exact prompt matching fails on such structurally similar prompts, while semantic caching may produce incorrect responses by ignoring critical differences. To address this, we introduce \ourmethod{}, a generative cache that produces variation-aware responses for structurally similar prompts. \ourmethod{} identifies reusable response patterns across similar prompt structures and synthesizes customized outputs for new requests. We show that \ourmethod{} achieves 83\% cache hit rate, while having minimal incorrect hits on datasets without prompt repetition. In agentic workflows, it improves cache hit rate by $\sim$20\% and reduces end-to-end execution latency by $\sim$34\% compared to standard prompt matching.

*Patrick Gerard,Aiden Chang,Svitlana Volkova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates if large language models (LLMs) aligned to specific communities mirror those communities' responses or merely recall training data patterns. It introduces a framework to test this and finds that aligned LLMs exhibit consistent behavioral patterns, even after factual data is removed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs aligned to specific online communities generate behaviors that reflect those communities' attitudes when exposed to uncertainty, or whether these behaviors are merely reproductions of training data patterns.

Method: A framework was developed that involves targeted deletion of knowledge (facts) from LLMs, using validation probes, followed by analysis of the models' behavioral patterns under uncertainty. Datasets used include Russian-Ukrainian military discourse and U.S. partisan Twitter data.

Result: Aligned LLMs showed stable and community-specific response patterns even after aggressive fact removal, indicating they are encoded with structured, generalizable behaviors beyond just surface-level mimicry.

Conclusion: LLMs can encode community-specific structured behaviors that persist even under ignorance, which has implications for the safety and transparency of their deployment in various contexts.

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) are aligned to a specific online community, do they exhibit generalizable behavioral patterns that mirror that community's attitudes and responses to new uncertainty, or are they simply recalling patterns from training data? We introduce a framework to test epistemic stance transfer: targeted deletion of event knowledge, validated with multiple probes, followed by evaluation of whether models still reproduce the community's organic response patterns under ignorance. Using Russian--Ukrainian military discourse and U.S. partisan Twitter data, we find that even after aggressive fact removal, aligned LLMs maintain stable, community-specific behavioral patterns for handling uncertainty. These results provide evidence that alignment encodes structured, generalizable behaviors beyond surface mimicry. Our framework offers a systematic way to detect behavioral biases that persist under ignorance, advancing efforts toward safer and more transparent LLM deployments.

*Vladimir Berman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores a non-linguistic, probabilistic model of text focusing on word structure and frequency distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural basis of word distributions in texts independent of linguistic or optimization principles.

Method: A mathematical model using a finite symbol alphabet and probabilistic space symbol distribution to derive structural word metrics and rank-frequency laws.

Result: Word lengths are geometrically distributed, vocabulary growth and critical word length depend on combinatorics, and Zipf-like rank-frequency patterns arise naturally.

Conclusion: Zipf-like patterns can emerge from random combinatorics and segmentation without linguistic or optimization-based explanations.

Abstract: We study a deliberately simple, fully non-linguistic model of text: a sequence of independent draws from a finite alphabet of letters plus a single space symbol. A word is defined as a maximal block of non-space symbols. Within this symbol-level framework, which assumes no morphology, syntax, or semantics, we derive several structural results. First, word lengths follow a geometric distribution governed solely by the probability of the space symbol. Second, the expected number of words of a given length, and the expected number of distinct words of that length, admit closed-form expressions based on a coupon-collector argument. This yields a critical word length k* at which word types transition from appearing many times on average to appearing at most once. Third, combining the exponential growth of the number of possible strings of length k with the exponential decay of the probability of each string, we obtain a Zipf-type rank-frequency law p(r) proportional to r^{-alpha}, with an exponent determined explicitly by the alphabet size and the space probability.
  Our contribution is twofold. Mathematically, we give a unified derivation linking word lengths, vocabulary growth, critical length, and rank-frequency structure in a single explicit model. Conceptually, we argue that this provides a structurally grounded null model for both natural-language word statistics and token statistics in large language models. The results show that Zipf-like patterns can arise purely from combinatorics and segmentation, without optimization principles or linguistic organization, and help clarify which phenomena require deeper explanation beyond random-text structure.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of generative LLMs like GPT for media frame analysis and compares them to traditional methods, discovering that manual coding and smaller models often outperform LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capability of generative LLMs in media frame analysis and compare them to traditional methods to identify their strengths, limitations, and potential optimal uses.

Method: The study compared LLMs, bag-of-words models, encoder-only transformers, and manual coding using a new dataset on US Mpox epidemic news coverage, developed iteratively for this purpose.

Result: Generative LLMs had limited effectiveness and were outperformed by manual coding and sometimes by smaller models. Human validation remained critical in all methodological approaches.

Conclusion: A pluralistic approach combining multiple methods is recommended for computational frame analysis, as this benefits from the complementarity of these tools.

Abstract: Computational approaches have previously shown various promises and pitfalls when it comes to the reliable identification of media frames. Generative LLMs like GPT and Claude are increasingly being used as content analytical tools, but how effective are they for frame analysis? We address this question by systematically evaluating them against their computational predecessors: bag-of-words models and encoder-only transformers; and traditional manual coding procedures. Our analysis rests on a novel gold standard dataset that we inductively and iteratively developed through the study, investigating six months of news coverage of the US Mpox epidemic of 2022. While we discover some potential applications for generative LLMs, we demonstrate that they were consistently outperformed by manual coders, and in some instances, by smaller language models. Some form of human validation was always necessary to determine appropriate model choice. Additionally, by examining how the suitability of various approaches depended on the nature of different tasks that were part of our frame analytical workflow, we provide insights as to how researchers may leverage the complementarity of these approaches to use them in tandem. We conclude by endorsing a methodologically pluralistic approach and put forth a roadmap for computational frame analysis for researchers going forward.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline to create speaker-attributed transcripts with metadata, enabling realistic simulations of multi-party deliberations using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of automatic speech recognition transcripts which lack speaker attribution, hindering realistic modeling and capturing consistent human behaviors in simulations.

Method: They develop a reproducible pipeline to transform Zoom recordings into speaker-attributed transcripts with metadata, including persona profiles and action tags, and release datasets from multiple domains for fine-tuning.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs using the speaker-attributed data leads to a 67% reduction in perplexity, improved classifier performance, and simulations that are often indistinguishable from real deliberations.

Conclusion: This method enables practical and scalable realistic civic simulations, advancing the application of LLMs in modeling complex human behaviors in deliberative contexts.

Abstract: Large language models offer opportunities to simulate multi-party deliberation, but realistic modeling remains limited by a lack of speaker-attributed data. Transcripts produced via automatic speech recognition (ASR) assign anonymous speaker labels (e.g., Speaker_1), preventing models from capturing consistent human behavior. This work introduces a reproducible pipeline to transform public Zoom recordings into speaker-attributed transcripts with metadata like persona profiles and pragmatic action tags (e.g., [propose_motion]). We release three local government deliberation datasets: Appellate Court hearings, School Board meetings, and Municipal Council sessions. Fine-tuning LLMs to model specific participants using this "action-aware" data produces a 67% reduction in perplexity and nearly doubles classifier-based performance metrics for speaker fidelity and realism. Turing-style human evaluations show our simulations are often indistinguishable from real deliberations, providing a practical and scalable method for complex realistic civic simulations.

TL;DR: DeepDebater is an AI system designed to win complete two-team competitive policy debates through a sophisticated multi-agent architecture and live presentation tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance artificial intelligence capabilities in understanding and participating in full-scale policy debates, surpassing prior systems limited to simplified debate formats.

Method: The system uses a hierarchical architecture of LLM-powered agents collaborating through iterative retrieval, synthesis, and self-correction processes, supported by a policy debate evidence corpus and an interactive rendering pipeline for presenting debates.

Result: DeepDebater demonstrates superior arguments and evidence in preliminary evaluations, consistently winning AI vs. AI matches and receiving preference from expert debate coaches.

Conclusion: DeepDebater establishes new benchmarks in AI-driven debate performance, paving the way for advanced AI in strategic persuasion and interactive applications.

Abstract: The capacity for highly complex, evidence-based, and strategically adaptive persuasion remains a formidable great challenge for artificial intelligence. Previous work, like IBM Project Debater, focused on generating persuasive speeches in simplified and shortened debate formats intended for relatively lay audiences. We introduce DeepDebater, a novel autonomous system capable of participating in and winning a full, unmodified, two-team competitive policy debate. Our system employs a hierarchical architecture of specialized multi-agent workflows, where teams of LLM-powered agents collaborate and critique one another to perform discrete argumentative tasks. Each workflow utilizes iterative retrieval, synthesis, and self-correction using a massive corpus of policy debate evidence (OpenDebateEvidence) and produces complete speech transcripts, cross-examinations, and rebuttals. We introduce a live, interactive end-to-end presentation pipeline that renders debates with AI speech and animation: transcripts are surface-realized and synthesized to audio with OpenAI TTS, and then displayed as talking-head portrait videos with EchoMimic V1. Beyond fully autonomous matches (AI vs AI), DeepDebater supports hybrid human-AI operation: human debaters can intervene at any stage, and humans can optionally serve as opponents against AI in any speech, allowing AI-human and AI-AI rounds. In preliminary evaluations against human-authored cases, DeepDebater produces qualitatively superior argumentative components and consistently wins simulated rounds as adjudicated by an independent autonomous judge. Expert human debate coaches also prefer the arguments, evidence, and cases constructed by DeepDebater. We open source all code, generated speech transcripts, audio and talking head video here: https://github.com/Hellisotherpeople/DeepDebater/tree/main

Method: The authors propose applying conformal prediction to filter irrelevant or redundant context while retaining relevant snippets. They test this method using embedding-based and LLM-based scoring functions on NeuCLIR and RAGTIME datasets.

Result: The conformal filtering approach meets its target coverage, reduces context size by 2-3x compared to unfiltered retrieval, and improves downstream accuracy in strict filtering scenarios.

Conclusion: Conformal prediction provides a reliable, coverage-controlled method for context reduction in RAG, contributing to effective and principled context engineering.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved evidence, but LLM accuracy declines when long or noisy contexts exceed the model's effective attention span. Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.

*Yuliang Zhan,Xinyu Tang,Han Wan,Jian Li,Ji-Rong Wen,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: L2V-CoT is a training-free method that transfers Chain-of-Thought reasoning from large language models (LLMs) to vision-language models (VLMs) by intervening with their latent representations, enabling improved multi-step reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges faced by vision-language models (VLMs) in multi-step reasoning tasks, leveraging the advancements of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning techniques developed for large language models (LLMs).

Method: The authors use Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) to reveal shared low-frequency latent representations between LLMs and VLMs. They propose L2V-CoT, a method that transfers CoT reasoning via latent intervention without training, by resampling and injecting low-frequency representations into VLMs during inference.

Result: Experiments show that L2V-CoT outperforms training-free baselines and even supervised methods in enhancing VLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The study concludes that CoT reasoning can be effectively transferred from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner, eliminating high costs and architectural limitations while improving reasoning performance.

Abstract: Recently, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks due to limited multimodal reasoning data. To bridge this gap, researchers have explored methods to transfer CoT reasoning from LLMs to VLMs. However, existing approaches either need high training costs or require architectural alignment. In this paper, we use Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) to empirically show that LLMs and VLMs share similar low-frequency latent representations of CoT reasoning despite architectural differences. Based on this insight, we propose L2V-CoT, a novel training-free latent intervention approach that transfers CoT reasoning from LLMs to VLMs. L2V-CoT extracts and resamples low-frequency CoT representations from LLMs in the frequency domain, enabling dimension matching and latent injection into VLMs during inference to enhance reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms training-free baselines and even surpasses supervised methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ELLA, an efficient framework for heterogeneous graph analysis that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle complex semantic relations and reduces computational complexity using novel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs due to semantic dependencies, lack of supervised signals, and high computational complexity of incorporating LLMs.

Method: Developed an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer for encoding multi-hop, multi-type relations, a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer for reducing computational complexity, and task-aware CoT prompts to bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning.

Result: The ELLA framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods in performance and efficiency, scaled up to 13 billion-parameter LLMs, and achieved up to 4x speedup in experiments across four heterogeneous graphs.

Conclusion: ELLA offers a robust solution to the challenges of modeling heterogeneous graphs by efficiently integrating LLMs and addressing semantic and complexity issues, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/l-wd/ELLA.

*Jianghao Wu,Yasmeen George,Jin Ye,Yicheng Wu,Daniel F. Schmidt,Jianfei Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes SPINE, a novel test-time reinforcement learning framework for reasoning models, addressing issues like response-length collapse and poor performance associated with prior TTRL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time reinforcement learning methods collapse due to uniform sequence updates, as they fail to align updates with crucial reasoning branch points. There is a need for a stable, label-free mechanism targeting these critical points to improve chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models.

Method: SPINE selectively updates high-entropy forking tokens, identified from forward-pass statistics, and applies entropy-band regularization to maintain exploration or suppress noise. It integrates with GRPO-style objectives without requiring labels or reward models.

Result: Across ten benchmarks (e.g., multimodal VQA, QA, mathematical reasoning, medical QA), SPINE improves Pass@1, avoids response-length collapse, and ensures stable training dynamics, outperforming existing TTRL methods on both LLM and MLLM.

Conclusion: SPINE effectively enhances test-time adaptation in reasoning models by focusing on chain-of-thought branch points. It offers a simple, label-free approach, improving performance and stability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) excel at chain-of-thought reasoning but face distribution shift at test-time and a lack of verifiable supervision. Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones. These results indicate that aligning updates with chain-of-thought branch points is a simple and label-free mechanism for stable and effective test-time adaptation in reasoning models.

*Shuo Zhang,Fabrizio Gotti,Fengran Mo,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of lexical training-data coverage for detecting hallucination in large language models, combining occurrence-based features with internal model signals for better prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenge of hallucination in large language models, particularly in open-domain question answering, by investigating the underexplored link between pretraining data exposure and hallucination.

Method: The study constructs suffix arrays over a pretraining corpus to retrieve n-gram statistics related to prompts and model-generated answers and evaluates the approach across QA benchmarks.

Result: Occurrence-based features alone are weak predictors but improve hallucination detection when combined with log-probabilities, especially in datasets with higher model uncertainty.

Conclusion: Lexical coverage features offer a complementary signal for hallucination detection, aiding in more accurate predictions for challenging cases.

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental challenge, particularly in open-domain question answering. Prior work attempts to detect hallucination with model-internal signals such as token-level entropy or generation consistency, while the connection between pretraining data exposure and hallucination is underexplored. Existing studies show that LLMs underperform on long-tail knowledge, i.e., the accuracy of the generated answer drops for the ground-truth entities that are rare in pretraining. However, examining whether data coverage itself can serve as a detection signal is overlooked. We propose a complementary question: Does lexical training-data coverage of the question and/or generated answer provide additional signal for hallucination detection? To investigate this, we construct scalable suffix arrays over RedPajama's 1.3-trillion-token pretraining corpus to retrieve $n$-gram statistics for both prompts and model generations. We evaluate their effectiveness for hallucination detection across three QA benchmarks. Our observations show that while occurrence-based features are weak predictors when used alone, they yield modest gains when combined with log-probabilities, particularly on datasets with higher intrinsic model uncertainty. These findings suggest that lexical coverage features provide a complementary signal for hallucination detection.

Motivation: The massive rise of TikTok among children/teenagers poses risks due to harmful content, challenging existing moderation approaches.

Method: The paper used multimodal classification integrating visual, audio, and text features, coupled with an efficient real-time streaming architecture for scalability.

Result: MTikGuard achieves high accuracy in harmful content detection using an expanded dataset and integration of multimodal features.

Conclusion: Advanced multimodal fusion and expanded datasets enable scalable and effective content moderation on TikTok.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of short-form videos, TikTok has become one of the most influential platforms among children and teenagers, but also a source of harmful content that can affect their perception and behavior.

TL;DR: This paper identifies attention heads in Llama-2-7b that disentangle semantic and surface-level information, enabling accurate transformations for tasks like word analogies and token manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and utilize the internal structures of LLMs, specifically how they represent semantic and surface-level information for tasks requiring token prediction.

Method: The authors focus on concept induction and token induction attention heads, using their attention weights to transform hidden states in Llama-2-7b, enabling structured arithmetic operations on the states.

Result: Transforming hidden states using concept attention heads improves semantic analogies' accuracy from 47% to 80%, while token heads reveal structured word manipulations.

Conclusion: Attention heads provide interpretable subspaces in LLM activations, enabling refined transformations that enhance understanding and manipulation of semantic and surface-level representations.

Abstract: In order to predict the next token, LLMs must represent semantic and surface-level information about the current word. Previous work identified two types of attention heads that disentangle this information: (i) Concept induction heads, which copy word meanings, and (ii) Token induction heads, which copy literal token representations (Feucht et al., 2025). We show that these heads can be used to identify subspaces of model activations that exhibit coherent semantic structure in Llama-2-7b. Specifically, when we transform hidden states using the attention weights of concept heads, we are able to more accurately perform parallelogram arithmetic (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the resulting hidden states, e.g., showing that "Athens" - "Greece" + "China" = "Beijing". This transformation allows for much higher nearest-neighbor accuracy (80%) than direct use of raw hidden states (47%). Analogously, we show that token heads allow for transformations that reveal surface-level word information in hidden states, allowing for operations like "coding" - "code" + "dance" = "dancing".

TL;DR: This paper compares vector-based and non-vector Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures for financial document Q&A, demonstrating that vector-based methods with advanced techniques yield better retrieval accuracy and answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation of vector-based versus non-vector RAG architectures for financial questions, and to understand the impact of advanced techniques on retrieval efficiency, answer quality, latency, and cost.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate vector-based RAG with hybrid search, metadata filtering, and enhancements like cross-encoder reranking and small-to-big chunk retrieval, compared to hierarchical node-based systems using metrics like MRR, Recall@5, latency, and preprocessing costs.

Result: Vector-based RAG had a 68% win rate over hierarchical systems while maintaining comparable latency. Cross-encoder reranking significantly improved MRR@5, and small-to-big chunk retrieval also performed well with minimal latency tradeoff.

Conclusion: Advanced RAG techniques enhance financial Q&A systems in retrieval accuracy and answer quality, but production requires a balance between performance improvements and resource costs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models to answer financial questions using external knowledge bases of U.S. SEC filings, earnings reports, and regulatory documents. However, existing work lacks systematic comparison of vector-based and non-vector RAG architectures for financial documents, and the empirical impact of advanced RAG techniques on retrieval accuracy, answer quality, latency, and cost remain unclear. We present the first systematic evaluation comparing vector-based agentic RAG using hybrid search and metadata filtering against hierarchical node-based systems that traverse document structure without embeddings. We evaluate two enhancement techniques applied to the vector-based architecture, i) cross-encoder reranking for retrieval precision, and ii) small-to-big chunk retrieval for context completeness. Across 1,200 SEC 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings on a 150-question benchmark, we measure retrieval metrics (MRR, Recall@5), answer quality through LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons, latency, and preprocessing costs. Vector-based agentic RAG achieves a 68% win rate over hierarchical node-based systems with comparable latency (5.2 compared to 5.98 seconds). Cross-encoder reranking achieves a 59% absolute improvement at optimal parameters (10, 5) for MRR@5. Small-to-big retrieval achieves a 65% win rate over baseline chunking with only 0.2 seconds additional latency. Our findings reveal that applying advanced RAG techniques to financial Q&A systems improves retrieval accuracy, answer quality, and has cost-performance tradeoffs to be considered in production.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agent-as-a-Graph retrieval, a system using knowledge graphs to enhance tool and agent selection in multi-agent systems; it shows meaningful improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for retrieving agents or tools in multi-agent systems are limited in granularity, often selecting based on generalized descriptions rather than detailed capabilities, leading to inefficient agent selection.

Method: The approach combines graph representation of agents and tools, vector search-based retrieval, weighted reciprocal rank fusion for tool- and agent-specific reranking, and final selection via knowledge graph traversal.

Result: Agent-as-a-Graph retrieval demonstrates 14.9% improvement in Recall@5, 14.6% improvement in nDCG@5, and 2.4% optimization advancements over previous state-of-the-art retrieval methods.

Conclusion: Graph-based retrieval is highly effective for representing and navigating multi-agent systems, proving better in agent and tool selection, enhancing performance and accuracy in multi-agent orchestration challenges.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model Multi-Agent Systems enable scalable orchestration and retrieval of specialized, parallelized subagents, each equipped with hundreds or thousands of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and tools. However, existing agent, MCP, and retrieval methods typically match queries against a single agent description, obscuring fine-grained tool capabilities of each agent, resulting in suboptimal agent selection. We introduce Agent-as-a-Graph retrieval, a knowledge graph retrieval augmented generation approach that represents both tools and their parent agents as nodes and edges in a knowledge graph. During retrieval, i) relevant agents and tool nodes are first retrieved through vector search, ii) we apply a type-specific weighted reciprocal rank fusion (wRRF) for reranking tools and agents, and iii) parent agents are traversed in the knowledge graph for the final set of agents. We evaluate Agent-as-a-Graph on the LiveMCPBenchmark, achieving 14.9% and 14.6% improvements in Recall@5 and nDCG@5 over prior state-of-the-art retrievers, and 2.4% improvements in wRRF optimizations.

Motivation: The aim is to enable the reuse of vast, heterogeneous, and often-underutilized archives of pharmaceutical research data for reverse translation.

Method: The authors implemented DiscoVerse with semantic retrieval, cross-document linking, and auditable synthesis. They tested it on Roche’s archives, involving historical data of 180 molecules spanning four decades and 0.87 billion tokens.

Result: DiscoVerse achieved near-perfect recall (≥ 0.99) and moderate precision (0.71-0.91) across seven queries. Qualitative assessments showed faithful synthesis regarding discontinuation rationale and organ-specific toxicity.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates DiscoVerse's utility in aiding pharmaceutical research, showcasing accurate data synthesis and decision-making support through systematic evaluation on real-world data.

Abstract: Pharmaceutical research and development has accumulated vast, heterogeneous archives of data. Much of this knowledge stems from discontinued programs, and reusing these archives is invaluable for reverse translation. However, in practice, such reuse is often infeasible. In this work, we introduce DiscoVerse, a multi-agent co-scientist designed to support pharmaceutical research and development. The system implements semantic retrieval, cross-document linking, and auditable synthesis on a large historical corpus from Roche. To validate our approach at real-world scale, we selected a subset of 180 molecules from the Roche research repositories, covering over 0.87 billion BPE tokens and more than four decades of research. Given that automated evaluation metrics are poorly aligned with scientific utility, we evaluate the performance of DiscoVerse using blinded expert evaluation of source-linked outputs. To our knowledge, this is the first agentic framework systematically assessed on real pharmaceutical data for reverse translation, enabled by authorized access to confidential, end-to-end drug-development archives. Our contributions include role-specialized agent designs aligned with scientist workflows; human-in-the-loop support for reverse translation; expert evaluation; and a large-scale demonstration showing promising answer accuracy and decision-making insights. In brief, across seven benchmark queries covering 180 molecules, DiscoVerse achieved near-perfect recall ($\geq 0.99$) with moderate precision ($0.71-0.91$), while qualitative assessments of discontinuation rationale and organ-specific toxicity showed faithful, source-linked synthesis across preclinical and clinical evidence.

Abstract: The detection of hallucinations in multilingual scientific text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant challenges for reliable AI systems. This paper describes our submission to the SHROOM-CAP 2025 shared task on scientific hallucination detection across 9 languages. Unlike most approaches that focus primarily on model architecture, we adopted a data-centric strategy that addressed the critical issue of training data scarcity and imbalance. We unify and balance five existing datasets to create a comprehensive training corpus of 124,821 samples (50% correct, 50% hallucinated), representing a 172x increase over the original SHROOM training data. Our approach fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-Large with 560 million parameters on this enhanced dataset, achieves competitive performance across all languages, including \textbf{2nd place in Gujarati} (zero-shot language) with Factuality F1 of 0.5107, and rankings between 4th-6th place across the remaining 8 languages. Our results demonstrate that systematic data curation can significantly outperform architectural innovations alone, particularly for low-resource languages in zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies methods to extract tabular data from building codes using pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs), emphasizing automated question answering over regulatory documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building codes are essential for safety and compliance, but extracting information from their tabular data is challenging due to complex layouts. Automating this process enhances efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The study compares a direct input method (processing images directly in VLMs) and an indirect input method (converting images to LaTeX format before answering questions). Both methods were enhanced by fine-tuning using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Result: Direct input method showed higher accuracy. Fine-tuning with LoRA led to significant improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct achieving over 100% accuracy gains.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning VLMs through parameter-efficient methods like LoRA offers great potential for processing complex structured data such as building codes.

Abstract: Building codes contain critical information for ensuring safety, regulatory compliance, and informed decision-making in construction and engineering. Automated question answering systems over such codes enable quick and accurate access to specific regulatory clauses, improving efficiency and reducing errors. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential for this task as they combine the precision of information retrieval with the generative capabilities of language models. However, tabular data are challenging to extract as they often involve complex layouts, merged cells, multi-row headers, and embedded semantic relationships that are not easily captured by traditional natural language processing techniques and Vision Language Models (VLMs). This paper explores and compares two methods for extracting information from tabular data in building codes using several pre-trained VLMs. First, a direct input method is used, where the image of the page is input directly into the VLMs, which are then tasked with answering questions based on the image. Second, an indirect input method is introduced, which involves converting an image of a page containing tables into the LaTeX code and then answering inquires based on the LaTeX-based input. The experiments find that the direct input method generally resulted in higher accuracy than the indirect input method. To further improve the performance, we fine-tuned each VLM using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a domain-specific tabular dataset. The fine-tuned models exhibited substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct achieving relative accuracy gains exceeding 100%. Our results highlight the potential of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to adapt powerful VLMs for understanding complex structured data in specialized fields, such as building code interpretation and regulatory compliance.

*Joseph Oladokun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR) is introduced to enhance LLM agents by combining graph constraints and semantic search, ensuring logical consistency in retrieved knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent retrieval methods lack structural consistency, causing incoherent reasoning chains due to disconnected information.

Method: Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR) restricts search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, ensuring logical alignment in retrieved context.

Result: PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to baseline methods and reduces graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent while maintaining relevance.

Conclusion: PCR effectively improves reasoning coherence and reliability in LLM systems by ensuring logical consistency in retrieved context.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents often retrieve context from knowledge bases that lack structural consistency with the agent's current reasoning state, leading to incoherent reasoning chains. We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval. PCR reduces the average graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent compared to baselines, demonstrating retrieval of more structurally consistent information. These findings suggest that path-constrained retrieval is an effective approach for improving the reliability and coherence of LLM agent reasoning systems.

*James Y. Huang,Wenxuan Zhou,Nan Xu,Fei Wang,Qin Liu,Sheng Zhang,Hoifung Poon,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniStruct, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability in text-to-structure tasks like information extraction, table generation, and function calling, using synthetic data and demonstrating its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are effective for unstructured text generation, but it is unclear if they perform well in generating structured outputs for diverse tasks; this paper aims to address that gap.

Method: The authors created OmniStruct, a unified benchmark with datasets adapted for structured answer formats and generated synthetic task data for training smaller LLMs without relying on supervised data.

Result: Experiments showed that fine-tuned smaller models with synthetic training data achieved performance comparable to GPT-4o in structured generation tasks.

Conclusion: Smaller models fine-tuned with synthetic data can efficiently handle structured text generation tasks, showcasing an alternative to using large-scale supervised data training.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate structured outputs that follow arbitrary schemas is crucial to a wide range of downstream tasks that require diverse structured representations of results such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. While modern LLMs excel in generating unstructured responses in natural language, whether this advancement translates to a strong performance on text-to-structure tasks remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first introduce OmniStruct, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities on diverse text-to-structure tasks such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. We build OmniStruct by identifying existing datasets across a wide range of tasks that are suitable for a structured answer format, and adapting them under a unified text-to-structure problem setting. To facilitate the development of efficient text-to-structure models, we collect high-quality training data via synthetic task generation. Without using any supervised data for OmniStruct tasks, our experiments demonstrate the possibility of fine-tuning much smaller models on synthetic data into universal structured generation models that can rival the performance of GPT-4o.

*Manon Berriche*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This thesis examines fake news prevalence and political polarization on social media through studies of Twitter and Facebook, concluding fake news sharing is concentrated among politicized users without fostering genuine debates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the contradiction between the small prevalence of fake news on social media and the intensified political polarization despite users’ limited receptiveness to fake news.

Method: It employs a mixed-methods approach combining digital trace analysis, online observation, and interviews. Two studies were conducted: mapping French Twitter users sharing fake news and analyzing Facebook user reactions to flagged items.

Result: Three main results emerge: (1) fake news sharing is restricted to a small group of politicized users who influence political agendas; (2) users deploy diverse forms of critical distance depending on their social position; (3) this critical distance rarely leads to substantive debates, instead fostering non-productive dialogues among active minorities.

Conclusion: Political polarization and engagement with fake news are driven by a small, politicized minority, suggesting limited deliberative impacts in broader social media ecosystems.

Abstract: This thesis addresses two paradoxes: (1) why empirical studies find that fake news represent only a small share of the information consulted and shared on social media despite the absence of editorial control or journalistic norms, and (2) how political polarization has intensified even though users do not appear especially receptive to fake news. To investigate these issues, two complementary studies were carried out on Twitter and Facebook, combining quantitative analyses of digital traces with online observation and interviews. This mixed-methods design avoids reducing users to single reactions to identified fake items and instead examines the variety of practices across different interactional situations, online and offline, while recording socio-demographic traits. The first study mapped users who shared at least one item labeled fake by fact-checkers in the French Twittersphere. The second used a corpus of items flagged by Facebook users to study reactions to statements whose epistemic status is uncertain. Three main findings emerge. First, sharing fake news is concentrated among a limited group of users who are not less educated or cognitively disadvantaged but are more politicized and critical of institutions; owing to their high activity and prolific sharing, they can help set the agenda for their political camp. Second, exposed users can deploy varying forms of critical distance depending on their social position and the interactional norms of the situations they inhabit: either discursive caution (prudence énonciative) or interventions ('points d'arrêt') that express disagreement or corrections. Third, these forms of critical distance seldom yield genuine deliberative debates or agonistic pluralism; rather, they often produce dialogues of the deaf among a small, particularly active minority.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the reliability and fairness of large language models (LLMs) in clinical decision support systems when faced with corrupted or degraded clinical texts. It introduces strategies to improve robustness and equity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address issues of reliability, fairness, and predictive uncertainty in AI-assisted clinical decision-making due to degraded clinical text inputs, which is crucial for sensitive medical tasks.

Method: The study systematically examines state-of-the-art LLMs under various text corruption scenarios, develops a clinically grounded label-reduction scheme, and employs a hierarchical chain-of-thought strategy to enhance robustness and emulate clinicians' reasoning.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates improved robustness and reduced instability among demographic subgroups when LLMs are tested with degraded clinical inputs, making them more reliable for clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed methods advance the use of LLMs in clinical decision support systems by addressing key challenges of robustness and fairness, paving the way for better AI-driven healthcare solutions.

Abstract: A decade of rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for clinical decision support systems (CDSS), with large language models (LLMs) demonstrating strong reasoning abilities on timely medical tasks. However, clinical texts are often degraded by human errors or failures in automated pipelines, raising concerns about the reliability and fairness of AI-assisted decision-making. Yet the impact of such degradations remains under-investigated, particularly regarding how noise-induced shifts can heighten predictive uncertainty and unevenly affect demographic subgroups. We present a systematic study of state-of-the-art LLMs under diverse text corruption scenarios, focusing on robustness and equity in next-visit diagnosis prediction. To address the challenge posed by the large diagnostic label space, we introduce a clinically grounded label-reduction scheme and a hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT) strategy that emulates clinicians' reasoning. Our approach improves robustness and reduces subgroup instability under degraded inputs, advancing the reliable use of LLMs in CDSS. We release code at https://github.com/heejkoo9/NECHOv3.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses advancements in mechanistic interpretability (MI) for language models by introducing a benchmarking framework—the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and a shared task to compare interpretability techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for assessing progress in mechanistic interpretability of language models.

Method: Two tracks are introduced: circuit localization, which examines influential components driving model behavior, and causal variable localization, which maps activations into interpretable features.

Result: Participants improved results in both tracks: notable advancements in circuit localization via ensemble and regularization strategies, and in causal variable localization through low-dimensional and non-linear projections of activation vectors.

Conclusion: The work highlights progress in MI methodologies and promotes the MIB as an open, standard evaluation framework to encourage further advancements in mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) seeks to uncover how language models (LMs) implement specific behaviors, yet measuring progress in MI remains challenging. The recently released Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB; Mueller et al., 2025) provides a standardized framework for evaluating circuit and causal variable localization. Building on this foundation, the BlackboxNLP 2025 Shared Task extends MIB into a community-wide reproducible comparison of MI techniques. The shared task features two tracks: circuit localization, which assesses methods that identify causally influential components and interactions driving model behavior, and causal variable localization, which evaluates approaches that map activations into interpretable features. With three teams spanning eight different methods, participants achieved notable gains in circuit localization using ensemble and regularization strategies for circuit discovery. With one team spanning two methods, participants achieved significant gains in causal variable localization using low-dimensional and non-linear projections to featurize activation vectors. The MIB leaderboard remains open; we encourage continued work in this standard evaluation framework to measure progress in MI research going forward.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents SmolKalam, a large-scale Arabic dataset designed for multi-turn reasoning and tool calling, translated and refined using advanced techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of high-quality, multi-turn Arabic datasets for reasoning and tool calling prompted the study.

Method: The authors utilized a multi-model ensemble translation pipeline with quality filtering and conducted ablation studies on translation effectiveness for decoder-only models.

Result: SmolKalam provides a substantial Arabic dataset with improved translation quality and insights into effective translation methods.

Conclusion: SmolKalam helps close the gap in Arabic dataset availability for complex language tasks with a rigorous translation and curation approach.

Abstract: Although the community has tackled the acquisition of high-quality Arabic pretraining data, we still lack large-scale, multi-turn Arabic datasets that include reasoning and tool calling. Naive translation can work at the pretraining scale, but post-training demands much higher quality, which requires a stricter approach to dataset curation. In this work, we introduce SmolKalam, a translation of Smoltalk2 that uses a multi-model ensemble translation pipeline, applies quality filtering, and examines effective translation techniques for traditional decoder-only models through ablations.

*Yu Xia,Sungchul Kim,Tong Yu,Ryan A. Rossi,Julian McAuely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework, which uses LLM agents to enhance personalized recommendations by leveraging dynamic multi-agent collaborations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic recommender systems do not sufficiently utilize collaborative signals and often lack recommendation-specific designs, leading to subpar performance.

Method: The proposed MACF framework creates user and item agents via LLMs, which retrieve tools, suggest items, and collaborate dynamically through a central orchestrator agent for personalized recommendations.

Result: Experiments across three domains demonstrate that MACF outperforms other state-of-the-art agentic recommendation methods.

Conclusion: MACF's innovative use of multi-agent collaboration and dynamic orchestration improves recommendation quality and redefines the role of agents in personalized recommendations.

Abstract: Agentic recommendations cast recommenders as large language model (LLM) agents that can plan, reason, use tools, and interact with users of varying preferences in web applications. However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel general agentic memory (GAM) framework for AI agents, emphasizing just-in-time memory compilation to optimize task performance while avoiding static memory limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static memory systems in AI suffer from severe information loss, limiting their efficiency in complex tasks.

Method: The GAM framework uses a duo-design: 1) Memorizer for lightweight historical context storage and universal page-store for complete historical information, and 2) Researcher for retrieving and integrating useful information at runtime. Reinforcement learning is employed for end-to-end performance optimization.

Result: Experimental results show GAM provides significant improvements over existing memory systems in memory-grounded task completion.

Conclusion: GAM is an effective alternative to static memory systems, enabling improved contextual reasoning and scalability by leveraging large language models.

Abstract: Memory is critical for AI agents, yet the widely-adopted static memory, aiming to create readily available memory in advance, is inevitably subject to severe information loss. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{general agentic memory (GAM)}. GAM follows the principle of "\textbf{just-in time (JIT) compilation}" where it focuses on creating optimized contexts for its client at runtime while keeping only simple but useful memory during the offline stage. To this end, GAM employs a duo-design with the following components. 1) \textbf{Memorizer}, which highlights key historical information using a lightweight memory, while maintaining complete historical information within a universal page-store. 2) \textbf{Researcher}, which retrieves and integrates useful information from the page-store for its online request guided by the pre-constructed memory. This design allows GAM to effectively leverage the agentic capabilities and test-time scalability of frontier large language models (LLMs), while also facilitating end-to-end performance optimization through reinforcement learning. In our experimental study, we demonstrate that GAM achieves substantial improvement on various memory-grounded task completion scenarios against existing memory systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current AI chatbots in mental health support, such as sycophancy, overvalidation, and reinforcing maladaptive beliefs, by providing a robust benchmarking framework.

Method: The authors developed MindEval, a framework for evaluating language models using patient simulations, automatic evaluations, and correlations with human-expert judgments, ensuring a realistic and reproducible setup.

Result: The evaluation of 12 state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrated that all models showed significant weaknesses, particularly in AI-typical communication errors, scoring below 4 out of 6 on average.

Conclusion: Reasoning capabilities and model scale do not ensure better results, and systems degrade over prolonged interactions or when dealing with severe patient symptoms. The authors release their resources for broader research advancement.

Abstract: Demand for mental health support through AI chatbots is surging, though current systems present several limitations, like sycophancy or overvalidation, and reinforcement of maladaptive beliefs. A core obstacle to the creation of better systems is the scarcity of benchmarks that capture the complexity of real therapeutic interactions. Most existing benchmarks either only test clinical knowledge through multiple-choice questions or assess single responses in isolation. To bridge this gap, we present MindEval, a framework designed in collaboration with Ph.D-level Licensed Clinical Psychologists for automatically evaluating language models in realistic, multi-turn mental health therapy conversations. Through patient simulation and automatic evaluation with LLMs, our framework balances resistance to gaming with reproducibility via its fully automated, model-agnostic design. We begin by quantitatively validating the realism of our simulated patients against human-generated text and by demonstrating strong correlations between automatic and human expert judgments. Then, we evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs and show that all models struggle, scoring below 4 out of 6, on average, with particular weaknesses in problematic AI-specific patterns of communication. Notably, reasoning capabilities and model scale do not guarantee better performance, and systems deteriorate with longer interactions or when supporting patients with severe symptoms. We release all code, prompts, and human evaluation data.

Result: Suggests literary scholars critically interact with LLMs at interpretability research sites.

Conclusion: Engagement with LLM interpretability research is essential for balanced interpretation standards.

Abstract: This position paper argues that literary scholars must engage with large language model (LLM) interpretability research. While doing so will involve ideological struggle, if not out-right complicity, the necessity of this engagement is clear: the abiding instrumentality of current approaches to interpretability cannot be the only standard by which we measure interpretation with LLMs. One site at which this struggle could take place, I suggest, is the red team.

We offer practical suggestions for data collection protocols, annotation, and model design, as well as evidence for the importance of performing human evaluation. In addition to the main dataset, multiple evaluation datasets, models, and code are made publicly available.

TL;DR: LightGBM outperforms GPT-4o in predicting the difficulty of competitive programming problems, achieving 86% accuracy versus 37.75% accuracy by GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess the difficulty prediction capabilities of GPT-4 versus an interpretable LightGBM model on competitive programming tasks.

Method: Conducted a comparative study using GPT-4o and LightGBM on 1,825 labeled LeetCode problems, supported by analyses such as SHAP interpretability and confusion matrices.

Result: LightGBM achieves stronger accuracy due to its reliance on explicit numeric constraints, while GPT-4o struggles, showing biases and failing synthetic tests.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4o have limitations as difficulty predictors, highlighting the need for improvement in structured assessment scenarios for competitive programming and educational tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language and code generation, and are increasingly deployed as automatic judges of model outputs and learning activities. Yet, their behavior on structured tasks such as predicting the difficulty of competitive programming problems remains under-explored. We conduct a systematic comparison of GPT-4o, used purely as a natural-language difficulty assessor, against an interpretable Light-GBM ensemble trained on explicit numeric and textual features. On a dataset of 1,825 LeetCode problems labeled Easy, Medium, or Hard, LightGBM attains 86% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o reaches only 37.75%. Detailed analyses, including confusion matrices and SHAP-based interpretability, show that numeric constraints -- such as input size limits and acceptance rates -- play a crucial role in separating Hard problems from easier ones. By contrast, GPT-4o often overlooks these cues and exhibits a strong bias toward simpler categories. We further probe GPT-4o through a synthetic Hard-problem generation protocol. Surprisingly, GPT-4o labels almost all of its own synthetic Hard problems as Medium, contradicting its tendency to downgrade real Hard problems to Easy. Our findings connect to recent work on LLMs-as-judges and automatic difficulty estimation in programming and education, and highlight concrete failure modes that must be addressed before LLM-based judges can be considered trustworthy in competitive programming, educational platforms, or reinforcement-learning pipelines.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models' ability to predict individuals' beliefs across diverse topics using a systematic benchmark, focusing on zero-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational approaches to beliefs are limited in scope and reliant on model fine-tuning. The authors aim to assess LLMs' generalization across belief domains.

Method: A reproducible benchmark is introduced, based on an online debate platform. The benchmark uses various conditions, isolating demographic and prior belief contributions, to evaluate LLMs' prediction capability in zero-shot settings.

Result: Findings show improved accuracy with more background information about individuals, but predictive success varies significantly across topics and belief domains.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit both strengths and limitations in modeling diverse human beliefs, paving the way for scalable belief system modeling beyond sociopolitical contexts.

Abstract: Beliefs are central to how humans reason, communicate, and form social connections, yet most computational approaches to studying them remain confined to narrow sociopolitical contexts and rely on fine-tuning for optimal performance. Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) across disciplines, how well these systems generalize across diverse belief domains remains unclear. We introduce a systematic, reproducible benchmark that evaluates the ability of LLMs to predict individuals' stances on a wide range of topics in a zero-shot setting using data from an online debate platform. The benchmark includes multiple informational conditions that isolate the contribution of demographic context and known prior beliefs to predictive success. Across several small- to medium-sized models, we find that providing more background information about an individual improves predictive accuracy, but performance varies substantially across belief domains. These findings reveal both the capacity and limitations of current LLMs to emulate human reasoning, advancing the study of machine behavior and offering a scalable framework for modeling belief systems beyond the sociopolitical sphere.

TL;DR: This study develops a hybrid BERT-CNN-BiLSTM model for Bangla news headline and sentiment classification, achieving improved performance over baseline methods and demonstrating state-of-the-art results for low-resource text classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate easier navigation and emotional understanding of vast Bangla news content by combining headline classification with sentiment analysis using NLP techniques in a low-resource setting.

Method: A hybrid BERT-CNN-BiLSTM model was applied to a BAN-ABSA dataset (containing 9014 Bangla news headlines) with two experimental sampling strategies for managing class imbalance before and after data splitting.

Result: The best performance was 81.37% for headline classification and 73.43% for sentiment analysis under different experimental conditions with the BERT-CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study establishes a strong baseline for Bangla news headline and sentiment classification, underlining the importance of advanced NLP techniques and effective handling of class imbalance in low-resource languages like Bangla.

Abstract: In our daily lives, newspapers are an essential information source that impacts how the public talks about present-day issues. However, effectively navigating the vast amount of news content from different newspapers and online news portals can be challenging. Newspaper headlines with sentiment analysis tell us what the news is about (e.g., politics, sports) and how the news makes us feel (positive, negative, neutral). This helps us quickly understand the emotional tone of the news. This research presents a state-of-the-art approach to Bangla news headline classification combined with sentiment analysis applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly the hybrid transfer learning model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM. We have explored a dataset called BAN-ABSA of 9014 news headlines, which is the first time that has been experimented with simultaneously in the headline and sentiment categorization in Bengali newspapers. Over this imbalanced dataset, we applied two experimental strategies: technique-1, where undersampling and oversampling are applied before splitting, and technique-2, where undersampling and oversampling are applied after splitting on the In technique-1 oversampling provided the strongest performance, both headline and sentiment, that is 78.57\% and 73.43\% respectively, while technique-2 delivered the highest result when trained directly on the original imbalanced dataset, both headline and sentiment, that is 81.37\% and 64.46\% respectively. The proposed model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM significantly outperforms all baseline models in classification tasks, and achieves new state-of-the-art results for Bangla news headline classification and sentiment analysis. These results demonstrate the importance of leveraging both the headline and sentiment datasets, and provide a strong baseline for Bangla text classification in low-resource.

Motivation: The research addresses the issue of performance collapse in language models caused by minor prompt variations and seeks robust methods to optimize prompt generation.

Method: The paper uses a graph representation of prompt space, systematic exploration with beam search and random walk algorithms, and evaluates optimization paths based on development sets.

Result: Beam search showed accuracy gains of 0.40-0.80 on reasoning tasks for development sets, though test set improvements were modest (0.20-0.50). Successful prompts tend to be concise, avoiding verbosity.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization as a search problem is validated, indicating potential for further improvement with enhanced computational and metric resources for deeper exploration beyond development sets.

Abstract: Language Models are extremely susceptible to performance collapse with even small changes to input prompt strings. Libraries such as DSpy (from Stanford NLP) avoid this problem through demonstration-based prompt optimisation. Inspired by this, I propose an alternative approach that treats prompt optimisation as a classical state-space search problem. I model the prompt space as a graph where nodes represent prompt states and edges correspond to deliberate transformations such as shortening, adding examples, or re- ordering content. Using beam search and random walk algorithms, I systematically explore this space, evaluating candidates on development sets and pruning unpromising branches. Across five NLP tasks (sentiment classification, question answering, summarisation, reason- ing, and natural language inference), I find that even shallow search configurations (beam width=2, depth=2) improve upon seed prompts on development sets. For instance, beam search achieves development accuracy gains from 0.40 to 0.80 on reasoning tasks, though test set improvements are more modest (0.20 to 0.50), indicating overfitting to the develop- ment heuristic. Analysis of successful optimisation paths reveals that transformations that make prompts concise appear most frequently, while verbosity operators are never selected. My results validate prompt optimization as a search problem and suggest that with greater computational resources and improved evaluation metrics, deeper exploration could yield more robust prompts that generalize beyond development sets.

### [104] [OpenGloss: A Synthetic Encyclopedic Dictionary and Semantic Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18622)
*Michael J. Bommarito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenGloss is a synthetically generated encyclopedic dictionary and semantic knowledge graph for English, providing a comprehensive linguistic dataset with integrated definitions, context, and relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an affordable and time-efficient comprehensive lexical resource for vocabulary learning and NLP tasks by leveraging foundation models.

Method: The resource was produced using a multi-agent procedural generation pipeline, schema-validated LLM outputs, and automated quality assurance.

Result: OpenGloss contains 537K senses, integrated lexicographic and encyclopedic content, and 9.1M semantic edges. It was produced in under one week for less than $1,000.

Conclusion: OpenGloss demonstrates that structured generation enables cost-efficient creation of high-quality lexical resources, addressing pedagogical gaps and offering publicly available data for further adaptation.

Abstract: We present OpenGloss, a synthetic encyclopedic dictionary and semantic knowledge graph for English that integrates lexicographic definitions, encyclopedic context, etymological histories, and semantic relationships in a unified resource. OpenGloss contains 537K senses across 150K lexemes, on par with WordNet 3.1 and Open English WordNet, while providing more than four times as many sense definitions. These lexemes include 9.1M semantic edges, 1M usage examples, 3M collocations, and 60M words of encyclopedic content.
  Generated through a multi-agent procedural generation pipeline with schema-validated LLM outputs and automated quality assurance, the entire resource was produced in under one week for under $1,000. This demonstrates that structured generation can create comprehensive lexical resources at cost and time scales impractical for manual curation, enabling rapid iteration as foundation models improve. The resource addresses gaps in pedagogical applications by providing integrated content -- definitions, examples, collocations, encyclopedias, etymology -- that supports both vocabulary learning and natural language processing tasks.
  As a synthetically generated resource, OpenGloss reflects both the capabilities and limitations of current foundation models. The dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face under CC-BY 4.0, enabling researchers and educators to build upon and adapt this resource.

*Shireen Chand,Faith Baca,Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes the unintended effects of bias mitigation in LLMs, finding that targeted approaches may reduce certain biases but increase others, impacting coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unintended cross-category effects of bias mitigation techniques in LLMs and highlight the limitations of current evaluation strategies.

Method: Analyzed four bias mitigation techniques across ten models from seven families, while assessing their effects on racial, religious, profession, and gender biases using the StereoSet benchmark.

Result: Targeted bias mitigation reduced the intended biases but often increased biases in other dimensions and decreased overall model coherence.

Conclusion: Current bias mitigation techniques are insufficient as they can unintentionally worsen other biases, emphasizing the need for multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit societal biases from their training data, potentially leading to harmful or unfair outputs. While various techniques aim to mitigate these biases, their effects are often evaluated only along the dimension of the bias being targeted. This work investigates the cross-category consequences of targeted bias mitigation. We study four bias mitigation techniques applied across ten models from seven model families, and we explore racial, religious, profession- and gender-related biases. We measure the impact of debiasing on model coherence and stereotypical preference using the StereoSet benchmark. Our results consistently show that while targeted mitigation can sometimes reduce bias in the intended dimension, it frequently leads to unintended and often negative consequences in others, such as increasing model bias and decreasing general coherence. These findings underscore the critical need for robust, multi-dimensional evaluation tools when examining and developing bias mitigation strategies to avoid inadvertently shifting or worsening bias along untargeted axes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates 24 Large Language Models (LLMs) using the 2026 Korean CSAT Mathematics section under strict contamination-free conditions, finding varying performances influenced by input modality, prompt language, and reasoning intensity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues of data leakage in existing benchmarks and systematically evaluate LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities using a real-world exam.

Method: Researchers digitized all questions within hours of the exam's release, employed 24 state-of-the-art LLMs, and analyzed their performance across input modalities and prompt languages.

Result: GPT-5 Codex achieved a perfect score, while Grok 4, GPT-5, and Deepseek R1 scored highly. Geometry posed significant challenges, and reasoning intensity enhanced performance but reduced efficiency.

Conclusion: Developed a contamination-free framework for LLM evaluation, highlighting model efficiency trade-offs and providing practical insights into LLM capabilities for mathematics reasoning.

Abstract: This study systematically evaluated the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the 2026 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) Mathematics section, ensuring a completely contamination-free evaluation environment. To address data leakage issues in existing benchmarks, we digitized all 46 questions (22 common and 24 elective) within two hours of the exam's public release, eliminating any possibility of inclusion in model training data. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs across varying input modalities (text, image, text+figure) and prompt languages (Korean, English).
  GPT-5 Codex achieved the only perfect score (100 points) with text input and Korean prompts, while Grok 4, GPT-5, and Deepseek R1 scored above 95 points. Notably, gpt-oss-20B achieved 95.7 points despite its relatively small size, demonstrating high cost-effectiveness. Problem-specific analysis revealed geometry as the weakest domain (77.7% average) with significant performance degradation on 4-point high-difficulty problems. Text input consistently outperformed image input, while prompt language effects varied by model scale.
  In reasoning enhancement experiments with GPT-5 series, increased reasoning intensity improved performance (from 82.6 to 100 points) but quadrupled token usage and drastically reduced efficiency, suggesting that models with minimal reasoning may be more practical. This research contributes: (1) implementation of a completely unexposed evaluation environment, (2) a real-exam-based LLM assessment framework, and (3) a practical evaluation perspective integrating performance, cost, and time considerations. Detailed results and model comparisons are available at the 2026 Korean CSAT LLM Evaluation Leaderboard (https://isoft.cnu.ac.kr/csat2026/).

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLaRa, a framework that enhances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with embedding-based compression and joint optimization in a continuous space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG methods are limited by issues in handling long contexts and disjointed retrieval-generation optimization.

Method: The method combines embedding-based compression with a key-preserving data synthesis framework (SCP), and trains rerankers and generators end-to-end with a differentiable top-k estimator.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CLaRa outperforms existing methods across multiple QA benchmarks, delivering superior compression and reranking performance.

Conclusion: CLaRa solves key limitations of RAG, proving effective in aligning retrieval relevance with generation quality and achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but still suffers from long contexts and disjoint retrieval-generation optimization. In this work, we propose CLaRa (Continuous Latent Reasoning), a unified framework that performs embedding-based compression and joint optimization in a shared continuous space. To obtain semantically rich and retrievable compressed vectors, we introduce SCP, a key-preserving data synthesis framework using QA and paraphrase supervision. CLaRa then trains the reranker and generator end-to-end via a single language modeling loss, with gradients flowing through both modules using a differentiable top-k estimator. Theoretically, this unified optimization aligns retrieval relevance with answer quality. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that CLaRa achieves state-of-the-art compression and reranking performance, often surpassing text-based fine-tuned baselines.

*Yu Lei,Shuzheng Si,Wei Wang,Yifei Wu,Gang Chen,Fanchao Qi,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RhinoInsight, a framework enhancing deep research capabilities using verifiable checklists and evidence audits to improve robustness, traceability, and content quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional linear pipelines in research systems suffer from error accumulation and lack of explicit control, necessitating a framework to address these issues for better quality and reliability.

Method: RhinoInsight employs two control mechanisms: Verifiable Checklist for traceable sub-goal planning and outline creation, and Evidence Audit for validating search content, refining outlines, and ensuring verification of evidence in the process.

Result: The study shows that RhinoInsight outperforms competitors in deep research tasks and remains competitive in deep search tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: RhinoInsight provides an effective and robust framework for deep research, ensuring quality and reliability without requiring parameter updates, making it a significant advancement in structured AI research approaches.

Abstract: Large language models are evolving from single-turn responders into tool-using agents capable of sustained reasoning and decision-making for deep research. Prevailing systems adopt a linear pipeline of plan to search to write to a report, which suffers from error accumulation and context rot due to the lack of explicit control over both model behavior and context. We introduce RhinoInsight, a deep research framework that adds two control mechanisms to enhance robustness, traceability, and overall quality without parameter updates. First, a Verifiable Checklist module transforms user requirements into traceable and verifiable sub-goals, incorporates human or LLM critics for refinement, and compiles a hierarchical outline to anchor subsequent actions and prevent non-executable planning. Second, an Evidence Audit module structures search content, iteratively updates the outline, and prunes noisy context, while a critic ranks and binds high-quality evidence to drafted content to ensure verifiability and reduce hallucinations. Our experiments demonstrate that RhinoInsight achieves state-of-the-art performance on deep research tasks while remaining competitive on deep search tasks.

### [110] [Large Language Models Require Curated Context for Reliable Political Fact-Checking -- Even with Reasoning and Web Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18749)
*Matthew R. DeVerna,Kai-Cheng Yang,Harry Yaojun Yan,Filippo Menczer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 15 recent large language models (LLMs) on fact-checking over 6,000 claims, finding that curated high-quality context substantially improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of large language models in automating the end-to-end fact-checking process and to address the need for rigorous evaluation of LLMs equipped with reasoning and web search tools.

Method: The authors analyzed 15 LLMs from OpenAI, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek, using PolitiFact-verified claims. They compared regular models, reasoning-augmented models, and web-search enabled variants.

Result: Standard models showed poor performance, reasoning capabilities gave slight improvements, and web search tools yielded moderate enhancement. A curated RAG system with PolitiFact summaries improved macro F1 by 233% across model variants.

Conclusion: Access to curated, high-quality context, rather than relying solely on reasoning or web search, offers a significant boost in automated fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have raised hopes for automated end-to-end fact-checking, but prior studies report mixed results. As mainstream chatbots increasingly ship with reasoning capabilities and web search tools -- and millions of users already rely on them for verification -- rigorous evaluation is urgent. We evaluate 15 recent LLMs from OpenAI, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek on more than 6,000 claims fact-checked by PolitiFact, comparing standard models with reasoning- and web-search variants. Standard models perform poorly, reasoning offers minimal benefits, and web search provides only moderate gains, despite fact-checks being available on the web. In contrast, a curated RAG system using PolitiFact summaries improved macro F1 by 233% on average across model variants. These findings suggest that giving models access to curated high-quality context is a promising path for automated fact-checking.

*Daiqing Wu,Dongbao Yang,Can Ma,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the DRF method for improving robustness in multimodal sentiment analysis by handling missing and low-quality image-text pairs effectively through distribution-based recovery and fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an increasing need to improve sentiment analysis in social media posts with image-text pairs due to potential modality issues like low quality and missing modalities in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose DRF, which utilizes feature distributions in queues to assess modality quality and recover missing modalities using inter-modal relationships supervised by sample distributions.

Result: Experiments with two strategies replicating real-world modality issues demonstrate that DRF universally enhances robustness and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three public datasets.

Conclusion: DRF is effective in tackling challenges of low-quality and missing modalities, showing promise in robust multimodal sentiment analysis for image-text pairs.

Abstract: As posts on social media increase rapidly, analyzing the sentiments embedded in image-text pairs has become a popular research topic in recent years. Although existing works achieve impressive accomplishments in simultaneously harnessing image and text information, they lack the considerations of possible low-quality and missing modalities. In real-world applications, these issues might frequently occur, leading to urgent needs for models capable of predicting sentiment robustly. Therefore, we propose a Distribution-based feature Recovery and Fusion (DRF) method for robust multimodal sentiment analysis of image-text pairs. Specifically, we maintain a feature queue for each modality to approximate their feature distributions, through which we can simultaneously handle low-quality and missing modalities in a unified framework. For low-quality modalities, we reduce their contributions to the fusion by quantitatively estimating modality qualities based on the distributions. For missing modalities, we build inter-modal mapping relationships supervised by samples and distributions, thereby recovering the missing modalities from available ones. In experiments, two disruption strategies that corrupt and discard some modalities in samples are adopted to mimic the low-quality and missing modalities in various real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments on three publicly available image-text datasets, we demonstrate the universal improvements of DRF compared to SOTA methods under both two strategies, validating its effectiveness in robust multimodal sentiment analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in low-resource Arabic ASR, proposing novel context-aware prompting strategies for adapting OpenAI's Whisper without retraining, leading to significant improvements in transcription quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic languages face transcription challenges due to dialectal variation and limited labeled data. The paper aims to overcome these challenges by leveraging prompting strategies instead of extensive model retraining.

Method: It proposes decoder prompting with first-pass transcriptions or retrieved utterances, encoder prefixing with synthesized speech, and other techniques like prompt reordering, speaker-aware prefix synthesis, and modality-specific retrieval.

Result: The approach achieves up to 22.3% reduction in WER for Modern Standard Arabic and 9.2% for dialectal Arabic speech. It also reduces problems like hallucinations and speaker mismatch.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies significantly improve the transcription performance of Whisper for Arabic speech recognition in real-world zero-shot settings, especially in low-resource conditions.

Abstract: Low-resource ASR remains a challenging problem, especially for languages like Arabic that exhibit wide dialectal variation and limited labeled data. We propose context-aware prompting strategies to adapt OpenAI's Whisper for Arabic speech recognition without retraining. Our methods include decoder prompting with first-pass transcriptions or retrieved utterances, and encoder prefixing using speech synthesized in the target speaker's voice. We introduce techniques such as prompt reordering, speaker-aware prefix synthesis, and modality-specific retrieval (lexical, semantic, acoustic) to improve transcription in real-world, zero-shot settings. Evaluated on nine Arabic linguistic conditions, our approach reduces WER by up to 22.3% on Modern Standard Arabic and 9.2% on dialectal speech, significantly mitigating hallucinations and speaker mismatch.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents HyperbolicRAG, a framework integrating hyperbolic geometry into graph-based retrieval-augmented generation for enhancing structural reasoning and mitigating hallucinations in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the structural reasoning capabilities of retrieval-augmented generation frameworks and better capture abstraction relationships in knowledge graphs, which are limited by traditional Euclidean embeddings.

Method: HyperbolicRAG features a depth-aware representation learner using a Poincare manifold, unsupervised contrastive regularization for geometric consistency, and a mutual-ranking fusion mechanism combining signals from Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces.

Result: HyperbolicRAG outperforms both standard RAG and graph-augmented baselines across multiple question-answering benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed HyperbolicRAG effectively enhances retrieval-augmented generation by integrating hyperbolic geometry, achieving superior performance in representing both semantics and global hierarchies.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge, helping mitigate hallucinations and enhance domain-specific expertise. Graph-based RAG enhances structural reasoning by introducing explicit relational organization that enables information propagation across semantically connected text units. However, these methods typically rely on Euclidean embeddings that capture semantic similarity but lack a geometric notion of hierarchical depth, limiting their ability to represent abstraction relationships inherent in complex knowledge graphs. To capture both fine-grained semantics and global hierarchy, we propose HyperbolicRAG, a retrieval framework that integrates hyperbolic geometry into graph-based RAG. HyperbolicRAG introduces three key designs: (1) a depth-aware representation learner that embeds nodes within a shared Poincare manifold to align semantic similarity with hierarchical containment, (2) an unsupervised contrastive regularization that enforces geometric consistency across abstraction levels, and (3) a mutual-ranking fusion mechanism that jointly exploits retrieval signals from Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, emphasizing cross-space agreement during inference. Extensive experiments across multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that HyperbolicRAG outperforms competitive baselines, including both standard RAG and graph-augmented baselines.

TL;DR: This paper addresses information overload in LLMs during Retrieval-Augmented Generation using an unsupervised context compression framework leveraging Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate information overload and inefficiencies in LLMs when processing long contexts with redundant data, especially in RAG.

Method: The authors propose a technique that uses AMR graphs to assess the importance of semantic nodes through entropy and compresses raw contexts by retaining essential information.

Result: The method achieves higher accuracy in reasoning tasks compared to baseline approaches while significantly reducing the length of contexts.

Conclusion: AMR-based conceptual entropy for context compression effectively preserves key information, improving both accuracy and efficiency during long-context tasks in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face information overload when handling long contexts, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) where extensive supporting documents often introduce redundant content. This issue not only weakens reasoning accuracy but also increases computational overhead. We propose an unsupervised context compression framework that exploits Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs to preserve semantically essential information while filtering out irrelevant text. By quantifying node-level entropy within AMR graphs, our method estimates the conceptual importance of each node, enabling the retention of core semantics. Specifically, we construct AMR graphs from raw contexts, compute the conceptual entropy of each node, and screen significant informative nodes to form a condensed and semantically focused context than raw documents. Experiments on the PopQA and EntityQuestions datasets show that our method outperforms vanilla and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing context length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work introducing AMR-based conceptual entropy for context compression, demonstrating the potential of stable linguistic features in context engineering.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational framework using neural topic modeling for efficient and reproducible analysis of focus group data. It evaluates hyperparameters, stability, and interprets results through human validation and provides guidelines for qualitative research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional manual coding for focus group discussion analysis, which is labor-intensive, non-scalable, and less reproducible.

Method: The researchers applied BERTopic to focus group transcripts, systematically evaluated 27 hyperparameter configurations, used bootstrap resampling for stability evaluation, and validated topics through formal human evaluation by domain experts.

Result: The results showed high sensitivity to hyperparameters and highlighted the importance of aligning metric selection with analytical goals. A hierarchical merging strategy improved topic coherence (0.558 vs 0.539), and human validation confirmed the quality of topics with strong inter-rater reliability.

Conclusion: The framework offers rigorous, adaptable computational methods to analyze focus group data and provides publicly available resources to ensure reproducibility and extension of the work.

Abstract: Focus group discussions generate rich qualitative data but their analysis traditionally relies on labor-intensive manual coding that limits scalability and reproducibility. We present a rigorous, reproducible computational framework for applying neural topic modeling to focus group transcripts, addressing fundamental methodological challenges: hyperparameter sensitivity, model stability, and validation of interpretability. Using BERTopic applied to ten focus groups exploring HPV vaccine perceptions in Tunisia (1,076 utterances), we conducted systematic evaluation across 27 hyperparameter configurations, assessed stability through bootstrap resampling with 30 replicates per configuration, and validated interpretability through formal human evaluation by three domain experts. Our analysis demonstrates substantial sensitivity to hyperparameter choices and reveals that metric selection for stability assessment must align with analytical goals. A hierarchical merging strategy (extracting fine-grained topics for stability then consolidating for interpretability) effectively navigates the stability-coherence tradeoff, achieving coherence of 0.558 compared to 0.539 for direct extraction. Human validation confirmed topic quality with very good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.79, weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.578). Our framework provides practical guidelines that researchers can adapt to their own qualitative research contexts. All code, data processing scripts, and evaluation protocols are publicly available to support reproduction and extension of this work.

*Václav Tran,Jakub Šmíd,Ladislav Lenc,Jean-Pierre Salmon,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study focuses on Czech text summarization, using advanced language models to improve results for both modern and historical Czech datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Czech text summarization, especially for historical documents, is underexplored due to linguistic complexity and a lack of annotated datasets.

Method: The study leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) like Mistral and mT5, along with a translation-based summarization approach, to handle Czech texts.

Result: LLMs achieved state-of-the-art performance on the SumeCzech dataset and introduced a new historical dataset, Posel od Čerchova, with initial baselines.

Conclusion: This research advances Czech summarization and provides frameworks and datasets for future studies in Czech historical document processing and low-resource language summarization.

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of automatically condensing longer texts into shorter, coherent summaries while preserving the original meaning and key information. Although this task has been extensively studied in English and other high-resource languages, Czech summarization, particularly in the context of historical documents, remains underexplored. This is largely due to the inherent linguistic complexity of Czech and the lack of high-quality annotated datasets.
  In this work, we address this gap by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Mistral and mT5, which have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and multilingual settings. In addition, we also propose a translation-based approach that first translates Czech texts into English, summarizes them using an English-language model, and then translates the summaries back into Czech. Our study makes the following main contributions: We demonstrate that LLMs achieve new state-of-the-art results on the SumeCzech dataset, a benchmark for modern Czech text summarization, showing the effectiveness of multilingual LLMs even for morphologically rich, medium-resource languages like Czech. We introduce a new dataset, Posel od Čerchova, designed for the summarization of historical Czech texts. This dataset is derived from digitized 19th-century publications and annotated for abstractive summarization. We provide initial baselines using modern LLMs to facilitate further research in this underrepresented area.
  By combining cutting-edge models with both modern and historical Czech datasets, our work lays the foundation for further progress in Czech summarization and contributes valuable resources for future research in Czech historical document processing and low-resource summarization more broadly.

*Fengyuan Liu,Huang Yi,Sichun Luo,Yuqi Wang,Yazheng Yang,Xinye Li,Zefa Hu,Junlan Feng,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogAlpha, a framework for discovering predictive financial signals using LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional financial data has a low signal-to-noise ratio, making it challenging to discover effective predictive signals (alphas). Current methods lack human-like exploration capabilities combining logic and creativity.

Method: CogAlpha leverages LLMs as cognitive agents to conduct iterative refinement, mutation, and recombination of alpha candidates using multi-stage prompts and financial feedback, enabling structured and creative exploration.

Result: Experiments on A-share equities show that CogAlpha consistently finds alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CogAlpha aligns evolutionary search with LLM reasoning to advance automated and explainable alpha discovery, demonstrating the potential for deeper and more diverse signal exploration in financial systems.

Abstract: Discovering effective predictive signals, or ``alphas,'' from financial data with high dimensionality and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio remains a difficult open problem. Despite progress in deep learning, genetic programming, and, more recently, large language model (LLM)--based factor generation, existing approaches still explore only a narrow region of the vast alpha search space. Neural models tend to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while symbolic or formula-based methods often yield redundant or economically ungrounded expressions that generalize poorly. Although different in form, these paradigms share a key limitation: none can conduct broad, structured, and human-like exploration that balances logical consistency with creative leaps. To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search. Treating LLMs as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework iteratively refines, mutates, and recombines alpha candidates through multi-stage prompts and financial feedback. This synergistic design enables deeper thinking, richer structural diversity, and economically interpretable alpha discovery, while greatly expanding the effective search space. Experiments on A-share equities demonstrate that CogAlpha consistently discovers alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods. Our results highlight the promise of aligning evolutionary optimization with LLM-based reasoning for automated and explainable alpha discovery. All source code will be released.

*Masoomali Fatehkia,Enes Altinisik,Husrev Taha Sencar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FanarGuard, a bilingual moderation filter for Arabic and English that evaluates both safety and cultural alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing moderation filters often focus only on general safety and neglect cultural context, creating a gap in model alignment for diverse cultures.

Method: The authors train FanarGuard using 468K prompt-response pairs scored for harmlessness and cultural awareness by LLM judges. They develop a benchmark for Arabic cultural contexts using over 1K norm-sensitive prompts and human-rated responses.

Result: FanarGuard demonstrates stronger agreement with human annotations than inter-annotator reliability and matches state-of-the-art filter performance on safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the significance of cultural awareness in moderation and establishes FanarGuard as a step forward in creating culturally sensitive safeguards.

Abstract: Content moderation filters are a critical safeguard against alignment failures in language models. Yet most existing filters focus narrowly on general safety and overlook cultural context. In this work, we introduce FanarGuard, a bilingual moderation filter that evaluates both safety and cultural alignment in Arabic and English. We construct a dataset of over 468K prompt and response pairs, drawn from synthetic and public datasets, scored by a panel of LLM judges on harmlessness and cultural awareness, and use it to train two filter variants. To rigorously evaluate cultural alignment, we further develop the first benchmark targeting Arabic cultural contexts, comprising over 1k norm-sensitive prompts with LLM-generated responses annotated by human raters. Results show that FanarGuard achieves stronger agreement with human annotations than inter-annotator reliability, while matching the performance of state-of-the-art filters on safety benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of integrating cultural awareness into moderation and establish FanarGuard as a practical step toward more context-sensitive safeguards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the capabilities of LLMs for improving personalized learning in the education domain, specifically generating high-quality and adaptive reading comprehension exercises.

Method: RCEG employs fine-tuned LLMs to produce exercise candidates, uses a discriminator for selecting the best candidate, and enhances content quality. A dedicated dataset and comprehensive metrics are utilized for evaluation.

Result: RCEG demonstrated significant improvements in the relevance, cognitive suitability, and content quality of English reading comprehension exercises.

Conclusion: The framework showcases the potential of LLMs in education by automating the creation of high-quality, adaptive learning content effectively.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), the applications of LLMs have grown substantially. In the education domain, LLMs demonstrate significant potential, particularly in automatic text generation, which enables the creation of intelligent and adaptive learning content. This paper proposes a new LLMs framework, which is named as Reading Comprehension Exercise Generation (RCEG). It can generate high-quality and personalized English reading comprehension exercises automatically. Firstly, RCEG uses fine-tuned LLMs to generate content candidates. Then, it uses a discriminator to select the best candidate. Finally, the quality of the generated content has been improved greatly. To evaluate the performance of RCEG, a dedicated dataset for English reading comprehension is constructed to perform the experiments, and comprehensive evaluation metrics are used to analyze the experimental results. These metrics include content diversity, factual accuracy, linguistic toxicity, and pedagogical alignment. Experimental results show that RCEG significantly improves the relevance and cognitive appropriateness of the generated exercises.

### [120] [Think Before You Prune: Selective Self-Generated Calibration for Pruning Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18864)
*Yang Xiang,Yixin Ji,Juntao Li,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates pruning techniques for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and introduces a Selective Self-Generated Reasoning (SSGR) strategy to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing inference overhead in LRMs' complex reasoning processes while maintaining performance levels.

Method: An empirical study analyzing pruning techniques and proposing SSGR, which uses challenging and moderately long self-generated reasoning data for calibration.

Result: SSGR improves reasoning ability of pruned LRMs by 10%-13% over existing pruning methods.

Conclusion: Effective pruning of LRMs can be achieved using tailored calibration data, specifically challenging and moderately long self-generated reasoning data.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning benchmarks. However, their long chain-of-thought reasoning processes incur significant inference overhead. Pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reducing computational costs. However, existing efforts have primarily focused on large language models (LLMs), while pruning LRMs remains unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first empirical study on pruning LRMs and show that directly applying existing pruning techniques fails to yield satisfactory results. Our findings indicate that using self-generated reasoning data for calibration can substantially improve pruning performance. We further investigate how the difficulty and length of reasoning data affect pruning outcomes. Our analysis reveals that challenging and moderately long self-generated reasoning data serve as ideal calibration data. Based on these insights, we propose a Selective Self-Generated Reasoning (SSGR) data construction strategy to provide effective calibration data for pruning LRMs. Experimental results on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series validate that our strategy improves the reasoning ability of pruned LRMs by 10%-13% compared to general pruning methods.

*Jingqian Zhao,Bingbing Wang,Geng Tu,Yice Zhang,Qianlong Wang,Bin Liang,Jing Li,Ruifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoreEval introduces a strategy to combat data contamination in LLM evaluations by updating datasets with current real-world knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how inadvertent access to test data during training affects the reliability and fairness of LLM evaluations.

Method: The approach extracts entity relationships, uses the GDELT database for current knowledge, integrates and refines the data, and iteratively verifies labels for consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments showed CoreEval robustly mitigates performance overestimations caused by data contamination.

Conclusion: CoreEval significantly improves contamination-resilient evaluations by enhancing dataset freshness and task relevance in LLM assessments.

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to the fairness of LLM evaluations in natural language processing tasks by inadvertently exposing models to test data during training. Current studies attempt to mitigate this issue by modifying existing datasets or generating new ones from freshly collected information. However, these methods fall short of ensuring contamination-resilient evaluation, as they fail to fully eliminate pre-existing knowledge from models or preserve the semantic complexity of the original datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CoreEval}, a \textbf{Co}ntamination-\textbf{re}silient \textbf{Eval}uation strategy for automatically updating data with real-world knowledge. This approach begins by extracting entity relationships from the original data and leveraging the GDELT database to retrieve relevant, up-to-date knowledge. The retrieved knowledge is then recontextualized and integrated with the original data, which is refined and restructured to ensure semantic coherence and enhanced task relevance. Ultimately, a robust data reflection mechanism is employed to iteratively verify and refine labels, ensuring consistency between the updated and original datasets. Extensive experiments on updated datasets validate the robustness of CoreEval, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating performance overestimation caused by data contamination.

*Adam Rychert,Gasper Spagnolo,Evgenii Posashkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper revisits the LLAMBO framework for Bayesian optimization using Llama 3.1 70B instead of GPT-3.5, confirming its effectiveness and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the robustness and performance of the LLAMBO framework by replacing GPT-3.5 with an open-weight language model (Llama 3.1 70B).

Method: Conduct reproducibility experiments with Bayesmark and HPOBench benchmarks, replicating the original evaluation protocol but using Llama 3.1 70B for text encoding and testing LLAMBO's components.

Result: The study confirms LLAMBO's claims about improved early regret behaviour and reduced variance. Smaller backbones lead to instability, suggesting that larger models like Llama 3.1 70B are crucial for LLAMBO's reliability.

Conclusion: LLAMBO is robust to language model changes and remains effective with Llama 3.1 70B, demonstrating the importance of model capacity for its reliability and performance.

Abstract: In this reproducibility study, we revisit the LLAMBO framework of Daxberger et al. (2024), a prompting-based Bayesian optimization (BO) method that uses large language models as discriminative surrogates and acquisition optimizers via text-only interactions. We replicate the core Bayesmark and HPOBench experiments under the original evaluation protocol, but replace GPT-3.5 with the open-weight Llama 3.1 70B model used for all text encoding components.
  Our results broadly confirm the main claims of LLAMBO. Contextual warm starting via textual problem and hyperparameter descriptions substantially improves early regret behaviour and reduces variance across runs. LLAMBO's discriminative surrogate is weaker than GP or SMAC as a pure single task regressor, yet benefits from cross task semantic priors induced by the language model. Ablations that remove textual context markedly degrade predictive accuracy and calibration, while the LLAMBO candidate sampler consistently generates higher quality and more diverse proposals than TPE or random sampling. Experiments with smaller backbones (Gemma 27B, Llama 3.1 8B) yield unstable or invalid predictions, suggesting insufficient capacity for reliable surrogate behaviour.
  Overall, our study shows that the LLAMBO architecture is robust to changing the language model backbone and remains effective when instantiated with Llama 3.1 70B.

### [123] [Look It Up: Analysing Internal Web Search Capabilities of Modern LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18931)
*Sahil Kale*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates whether large language models effectively use web search, revealing improvements in accuracy but issues with confidence calibration and query formulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how well large language models integrate web search for real-time information retrieval and calibration.

Method: The benchmark tests 783 pre-cutoff questions and 288 post-cutoff queries to evaluate necessity and effectiveness of web search in models like GPT-5-mini and Claude Haiku 4.5.

Result: Web search improves static accuracy but worsens confidence calibration. Dynamic queries show weak query formulation and sub-70% accuracy with diminishing improvement after failed searches.

Conclusion: While web search enhances factual accuracy and can be used selectively, models are often overconfident, inconsistent, and fail when initial query retrieval is unsuccessful, leaving room for improvement.

Abstract: Modern large language models integrate web search to provide real-time answers, yet it remains unclear whether they are efficiently calibrated to use search when it is actually needed. We introduce a benchmark evaluating both the necessity and effectiveness of web access across commercial models with no access to internal states or parameters. The dataset includes a static split of 783 temporally anchored questions answerable from pre-cutoff knowledge, aimed at testing whether models invoke search based on low internal confidence, and a dynamic split of 288 post-cutoff queries designed to test whether models recognise when search is required and retrieve updated information. Web access substantially improves static accuracy for GPT-5-mini and Claude Haiku 4.5, though confidence calibration worsens. On dynamic queries, both models frequently invoke search yet remain below 70 percent accuracy due to weak query formulation. Costs per accuracy-improving call remain low, but returns diminish once initial retrieval fails. Selective invocation helps, but models become overconfident and inconsistent after search. Overall, built-in web search meaningfully improves factual accuracy and can be invoked selectively, yet models remain overconfident, skip retrieval when it is essential, and falter once initial search queries underperform. Taken together, internal web search works better as a good low-latency verification layer than a reliable analytical tool, with clear room for improvement.

*Yuchen Ji,Bo Xu,Jie Shi,Jiaqing Liang,Deqing Yang,Yu Mao,Hai Chen,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Text-to-Query paradigm for unifying semantic parsing across diverse query languages, proposing a dynamic data augmentation framework to improve model performance on shared query skeletons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic parsing studies focus on individual query languages, lacking methods that generalize well across multiple languages.

Method: The approach defines the Text-to-Query paradigm, emphasizing query skeleton optimization, and proposes a dynamic data augmentation system to address model weaknesses through synthesized training data.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal synthesized data, showcasing the method's efficiency and generality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework establishes a solid foundation for unifying semantic parsing research across different query languages and demonstrates its practical efficiency.

Abstract: The task of translating natural language questions into query languages has long been a central focus in semantic parsing. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in this field. However, existing studies typically focus on a single query language, resulting in methods with limited generalizability across different languages. In this paper, we formally define the Text-to-Query task paradigm, unifying semantic parsing tasks across various query languages. We identify query skeletons as a shared optimization target of Text-to-Query tasks, and propose a general dynamic data augmentation framework that explicitly diagnoses model-specific weaknesses in handling these skeletons to synthesize targeted training data. Experiments on four Text-to-Query benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a small amount of synthesized data, highlighting the efficiency and generality of our approach and laying a solid foundation for unified research on Text-to-Query tasks. We release our code at https://github.com/jjjycaptain/Skeletron.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a knowledge-based graphical method using Safeterm to enhance AE analysis in clinical trials by regrouping terms and providing visual tools, ultimately improving interpretation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the process of reviewing treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials for better clarity, efficiency, and accuracy.

Method: Introducing a hidden medical knowledge layer (Safeterm) to augment MedDRA, enabling automatic regrouping of AE Preferred Terms, computing disproportionality metrics, and providing visualizations for interpretation.

Result: The method successfully recovers expected safety signals in three legacy trials and demonstrates enhanced clarity and efficiency in AE interpretation.

Conclusion: Augmenting MedDRA with the Safeterm layer enhances the quality of adverse event analysis and interpretation in clinical trials with improved semantic clarity and visualization tools.

Abstract: We present a graphical, knowledge-based method for reviewing treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials. The approach enhances MedDRA by adding a hidden medical knowledge layer (Safeterm) that captures semantic relationships between terms in a 2-D map. Using this layer, AE Preferred Terms can be regrouped automatically into similarity clusters, and their association to the trial disease may be quantified. The Safeterm map is available online and connected to aggregated AE incidence tables from ClinicalTrials.gov. For signal detection, we compute treatment-specific disproportionality metrics using shrinkage incidence ratios. Cluster-level EBGM values are then derived through precision-weighted aggregation. Two visual outputs support interpretation: a semantic map showing AE incidence and an expectedness-versus-disproportionality plot for rapid signal detection. Applied to three legacy trials, the automated method clearly recovers all expected safety signals. Overall, augmenting MedDRA with a medical knowledge layer improves clarity, efficiency, and accuracy in AE interpretation for clinical trials.

*Hayami Takahashi,Kensuke Takahashi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic emotion expression model using a concept called "Effect of Contradictory Structure," which complements natural language via overlapping operations (montage) and intensity as an element.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop an alternative form of emotional expression that complements natural language, acting as a proxy for emotional states.

Method: The model is based on the "Effect of Contradictory Structure," which involves dynamic effects (pleasantness/unpleasantness), montage for overlapping effects, and the concept of intensity from philosophical theories as a component.

Result: The paper demonstrates the "Effect of Structure" process using the example of educational progression.

Conclusion: This theoretical framework provides a unique way to express emotions, adding depth to natural language through a dynamic contradictory structure and intensity.

Abstract: In expressing emotions, as an expression form separate from natural language, we propose an alternative form that complements natural language, acting as a proxy or window for emotional states. First, we set up an expression form "Effect of Contradictory Structure." "Effect of Contradictory Structure" is not static but dynamic. Effect in "Effect of Contradictory Structure" is unpleasant or pleasant, and the orientation to avoid that unpleasantness is considered pseudo-expression of will. Second, "Effect of Contradictory Structure" can be overlapped with each other. This overlapping operation is called "montage." A broader "Structure" that includes related "Effect of Contradictory Structure" and "Effect of Structure" are set up. Montage produces "Effect of Structure". In montage, it is necessary to set something like "strength," so we adopted Deleuze and Deleuze/Guattari's word "intensity" and set it as an element of our model. We set up a general theoretical framework - Word Import Between Systems (Models) and justified the import of "intensity" through Austin's use of the word "force." "Effect of Structure" process is demonstrated using the example of proceeding to the next level of education.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphMind, a novel graph-based framework integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve multi-step reasoning through structured and interpretable processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of an explicit and dynamic mechanism in existing approaches to structurally represent and evolve intermediate reasoning states, enabling improved theorem selection and iterative conclusion generation.

Method: GraphMind models reasoning as a heterogeneous evolving graph where nodes represent conditions, theorems, and conclusions, while edges capture logical dependencies. A Graph Neural Network encodes the reasoning state, and semantic matching enables context-aware theorem selection.

Result: Experiments show that GraphMind consistently improves performance and significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in multi-step reasoning across various QA datasets.

Conclusion: GraphMind offers a structured, interpretable, and effective approach to multi-step reasoning by leveraging dynamic graph-based modeling, proving its effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, including multi-step reasoning such as mathematical proving. However, existing approaches often lack an explicit and dynamic mechanism to structurally represent and evolve intermediate reasoning states, which limits their ability to perform context-aware theorem selection and iterative conclusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GraphMind, a novel dynamic graph-based framework that integrates the graph neural network (GNN) with LLMs to iteratively select theorems and generate intermediate conclusions for multi-step reasoning. Our method models the reasoning process as a heterogeneous evolving graph, where nodes represent conditions, theorems, and conclusions, while edges capture logical dependencies between nodes. By encoding the current reasoning state with GNN and leveraging semantic matching for theorem selection, our framework enables context-aware, interpretable, and structured reasoning in a closed-loop manner. Experiments on various question-answering (QA) datasets demonstrate that our proposed GraphMind method achieves consistent performance improvements and significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-step reasoning, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

*Wenxuan Mu,Jinzhong Ning,Di Zhao,Yijia Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes KDR-Agent, which enhances in-context learning for named entity recognition (NER) by integrating knowledge retrieval, disambiguation, and reflective analysis to overcome low-resource and multi-domain challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by limitations in current in-context learning methods for NER, such as dependence on dynamic retrieval of annotated examples, limited generalization to unseen domains, and inability to incorporate external knowledge or resolve ambiguities.

Method: KDR-Agent employs a multi-agent framework using type definitions and entity-level demonstrations, coordinated by a central planner to retrieve domain-specific knowledge, resolve ambiguities, and self-assess model predictions.

Result: Experiments on ten datasets from five domains show that KDR-Agent achieves superior performance compared to existing zero-shot and few-shot NER methods across multiple LLM backbones.

Conclusion: KDR-Agent addresses the limitations of ICL-based NER methods and demonstrates enhanced efficiency and accuracy in low-resource, multi-domain scenarios, offering potential practical utility in real-world applications.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising paradigm for named entity recognition (NER) in low-resource scenarios. However, existing ICL-based NER methods suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on dynamic retrieval of annotated examples, which is problematic when annotated data is scarce; (2) limited generalization to unseen domains due to the LLM's insufficient internal domain knowledge; and (3) failure to incorporate external knowledge or resolve entity ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose KDR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for multi-domain low-resource in-context NER that integrates Knowledge retrieval, Disambiguation, and Reflective analysis. KDR-Agent leverages natural-language type definitions and a static set of entity-level contrastive demonstrations to reduce dependency on large annotated corpora. A central planner coordinates specialized agents to (i) retrieve factual knowledge from Wikipedia for domain-specific mentions, (ii) resolve ambiguous entities via contextualized reasoning, and (iii) reflect on and correct model predictions through structured self-assessment. Experiments across ten datasets from five domains demonstrate that KDR-Agent significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and few-shot ICL baselines across multiple LLM backbones.

*Ziyuan Gao,Di Liang,Xianjie Wu,Philippe Morel,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeCoRL revolutionizes chain-of-thought reasoning using modular approaches for parallel processing, precision error attribution, and coordinated reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning methods for chain-of-thought reasoning are hindered by their lack of transparency in individual step contributions and inefficiency caused by sequential processing, making real-time deployment and detailed error analysis challenging.

Method: DeCoRL introduces modular coordinated models for reasoning sub-steps to enable parallel processing. It uses modular reward functions for independent scoring of sub-steps and cascaded DRPO optimization to maintain inter-step dependency.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks, providing 3.8x faster inference, 22.7% better interpretability, 72.4% energy reduction, and a 68% improvement in throughput compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DeCoRL addresses key limitations of prior reasoning systems by improving reasoning efficiency, interpretability, and energy consumption, enabling practical real-time deployment of complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning methods for Chain-of-Thought reasoning suffer from two critical limitations. First, they operate as monolithic black boxes that provide undifferentiated reward signals, obscuring individual step contributions and hindering error diagnosis. Second, sequential decoding has O(n) time complexity. This makes real-time deployment impractical for complex reasoning tasks. We present DeCoRL (Decoupled Reasoning Chains via Coordinated Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that transforms reasoning from sequential processing into collaborative modular orchestration. DeCoRL trains lightweight specialized models to generate reasoning sub-steps concurrently, eliminating sequential bottlenecks through parallel processing. To enable precise error attribution, the framework designs modular reward functions that score each sub-step independently. Cascaded DRPO optimization then coordinates these rewards while preserving inter-step dependencies. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art results across RM-Bench, RMB, and RewardBench, outperforming existing methods including large-scale models. DeCoRL delivers 3.8 times faster inference while maintaining superior solution quality and offers a 22.7\% improvement in interpretability through explicit reward attribution. These advancements, combined with a 72.4\% reduction in energy consumption and a 68\% increase in throughput, make real-time deployment of complex reasoning systems a reality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the diversity in Nawatl orthographies and create a consistent method for automatically unifying text documents in this indigenous language.

Method: The paper employs symbolic regular expressions to implement linguistic rules for unification, leveraging a corpus called $π$-yalli, and uses a manual evaluation protocol to assess unified sentences via semantic tasks.

Result: Evaluation showed promising outcomes, as most desired features of the generated unified sentences were positively received by evaluators.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm demonstrates effective orthographic unification in Nawatl text documents and marks progress towards consistency in Nawatl text processing.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a symbolic model for the automatic orthographic unification of Nawatl text documents. Our model is based on algorithms that we have previously used to analyze sentences in Nawatl, and on the corpus called $π$-yalli, consisting of texts in several Nawatl orthographies. Our automatic unification algorithm implements linguistic rules in symbolic regular expressions. We also present a manual evaluation protocol that we have proposed and implemented to assess the quality of the unified sentences generated by our algorithm, by testing in a sentence semantic task. We have obtained encouraging results from the evaluators for most of the desired features of our artificially unified sentences

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information-theoretic framework for studying naming systems in languages and proves conditions for achieving optimal trade-offs between informativeness and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in prior studies on naming systems, such as assuming optimal listeners and universal communicative needs.

Method: The authors develop a framework using information theory and a referential game setup to study naming systems, focusing on the semantic domain of kinship.

Result: The study proves that optimal trade-offs are achievable under Bayesian decoding and demonstrates their empirical emergence in learned communication systems.

Conclusion: Optimality in naming systems can theoretically and empirically emerge under specific communicative and decoding conditions.

Abstract: The structure of naming systems in natural languages hinges on a trade-off between high informativeness and low complexity. Prior work capitalizes on information theory to formalize these notions; however, these studies generally rely on two simplifications: (i) optimal listeners, and (ii) universal communicative need across languages. Here, we address these limitations by introducing an information-theoretic framework for discrete object naming systems, and we use it to prove that an optimal trade-off is achievable if and only if the listener's decoder is equivalent to the Bayesian decoder of the speaker. Adopting a referential game setup from emergent communication, and focusing on the semantic domain of kinship, we show that our notion of optimality is not only theoretically achievable but also emerges empirically in learned communication systems.

*Yaping Chai,Haoran Xie,Joe S. Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposed an emotion-enhanced multi-task ACSA framework that combines sentiment polarity and category-specific emotions to improve fine-grained sentiment analysis using Ekman's six basic emotions and VAD refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sentiment analysis approaches overly prioritize polarity while neglecting emotional dimensions, limiting fine-grained understanding of sentiments related to specific aspect categories.

Method: A novel multi-task framework was created to jointly analyze sentiment polarity and specific emotions using generative capabilities of LLMs and a refinement mechanism based on the VAD framework.

Result: The framework significantly outperformed baseline methods across benchmark datasets, proving the efficacy of integrating emotions into sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: Incorporating affective dimensions enhances ACSA accuracy, capturing nuanced emotional signals beyond simple polarity.

Abstract: Aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) has achieved remarkable progress with large language models (LLMs), yet existing approaches primarily emphasize sentiment polarity while overlooking the underlying emotional dimensions that shape sentiment expressions. This limitation hinders the model's ability to capture fine-grained affective signals toward specific aspect categories. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel emotion-enhanced multi-task ACSA framework that jointly learns sentiment polarity and category-specific emotions grounded in Ekman's six basic emotions. Leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs, our approach enables the model to produce emotional descriptions for each aspect category, thereby enriching sentiment representations with affective expressions. Furthermore, to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the generated emotions, we introduce an emotion refinement mechanism based on the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) dimensional framework. Specifically, emotions predicted by the LLM are projected onto a VAD space, and those inconsistent with their corresponding VAD coordinates are re-annotated using a structured LLM-based refinement strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines on all benchmark datasets. This underlines the effectiveness of integrating affective dimensions into ACSA.

*Zijian Wang,Yanxiang Ma,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to improve Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) through probabilistic hidden state manipulation, outperforming previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Base LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to the lack of specialized training. Traditional methods for enhancing reasoning capabilities, like linear activation steering, face limitations such as distribution shifts and degraded text quality.

Method: The authors propose a probabilistic hidden state manipulation approach by framing the reasoning problem as an optimization challenge. They employ a balance of likelihood and prior regularization to guide hidden states into reasoning-oriented paths while maintaining language quality.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing steering techniques across benchmarks for mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks, highlighting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: By introducing a theoretically sound and practical optimization approach, this work enhances the reasoning ability of base LLMs, proving its potential as a significant improvement over previous methods.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to tackle com- plex multi-step tasks. While base LLMs, pre-trained on general text corpora, often struggle with reasoning due to a lack of specialized training, recent studies reveal their latent reason- ing potential tied to hidden states. However, existing hidden state manipulation methods, such as linear activation steering, suffer from limitations due to their rigid and unconstrained nature, often leading to distribution shifts and degraded text quality. In this work, we propose a novel approach for elic- iting CoT reasoning from base LLMs through hidden state manipulation grounded in probabilistic conditional generation. By reformulating the challenge as an optimization problem with a balanced likelihood and prior regularization framework, our method guides hidden states toward reasoning-oriented trajectories while preserving linguistic coherence. Extensive evaluations across mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach con- sistently outperforms existing steering methods, offering a theoretically principled and effective solution for enhancing reasoning capabilities in base LLMs.

*Samantha Dies,Courtney Maynard,Germans Savcisens,Tina Eliassi-Rad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) differentiate between true, false, and ambiguous content by measuring their representational stability through perturbations in truth definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how robustly LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and ambiguous content in their probabilistic representations, addressing concerns about their reliability in factual judgments.

Method: The authors propose a linear probe to classify LLM activations as true or not-true, followed by measuring decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. They test this across multiple LLMs and factual domains using different types of ambiguous statements.

Result: The study finds that unfamiliar fictional or seldom-seen statements induce more instability in truth representations compared to familiar fictional contexts, producing up to 40% flipped decisions in domains sensitive to ambiguity.

Conclusion: Epistemic familiarity shapes LLM representational stability more strongly than linguistic form, offering a structured diagnostic for improving truth coherence in these models beyond accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for factual tasks such as "What treats asthma?" or "What is the capital of Latvia?". However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\leq 8.2\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form. More broadly, our approach provides a diagnostic for auditing and training LLMs to preserve coherent truth assignments under semantic uncertainty, rather than optimizing for output accuracy alone.

*Christos-Nikolaos Zacharopoulos,Revekka Kyriakoglou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how transformer models identify semantic anomalies, using probing techniques across different layers during sentence processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the layer-by-layer mechanism of semantic anomaly detection in transformers, inspired by psycholinguistic observations in human reading.

Method: Using the phi-2 causal language model, the paper employs linear probes for per-layer detection and dimensionality analysis of encoded violations.

Result: The study found semantic anomaly detection becomes effective in middle layers, suggesting exploratory then consolidative processing phases.

Conclusion: Transformer models mimic late-stage semantic anomaly detection similar to psycholinguistic patterns observed in human reading.

Abstract: How and where does a transformer notice that a sentence has gone semantically off the rails? To explore this question, we evaluated the causal language model (phi-2) using a carefully curated corpus, with sentences that concluded plausibly or implausibly. Our analysis focused on the hidden states sampled at each model layer. To investigate how violations are encoded, we utilized two complementary probes. First, we conducted a per-layer detection using a linear probe. Our findings revealed that a simple linear decoder struggled to distinguish between plausible and implausible endings in the lowest third of the model's layers. However, its accuracy sharply increased in the middle blocks, reaching a peak just before the top layers. Second, we examined the effective dimensionality of the encoded violation. Initially, the violation widens the representational subspace, followed by a collapse after a mid-stack bottleneck. This might indicate an exploratory phase that transitions into rapid consolidation. Taken together, these results contemplate the idea of alignment with classical psycholinguistic findings in human reading, where semantic anomalies are detected only after syntactic resolution, occurring later in the online processing sequence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study developed a Bangla dataset of over 54,000 articles for abstractive text summarization spanning multiple domains and styles, trained and benchmarked with advanced NLP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of adaptable summarization systems for Bangla texts outside of fixed styles, considering the growing digital Bangla content across various platforms.

Method: A diverse dataset was created from blogs, newspapers, and social media, spanning multiple styles, trained and evaluated using LSTM and transfer learning models like BanglaT5-small and MTS-small.

Result: The dataset demonstrated high adaptability when benchmarked with deep learning models, highlighting its capability as a resource for further research in Bangla NLP.

Conclusion: This dataset makes a significant contribution to NLP tools for Bangla, especially as a low-resource language, by providing an adaptable and high-quality foundation for summarization systems.

Abstract: This study developed a new Bangla abstractive summarization dataset to generate concise summaries of Bangla articles from diverse sources. Most existing studies in this field have concentrated on news articles, where journalists usually follow a fixed writing style. While such approaches are effective in limited contexts, they often fail to adapt to the varied nature of real-world Bangla texts. In today's digital era, a massive amount of Bangla content is continuously produced across blogs, newspapers, and social media. This creates a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand content more quickly. To address this challenge, we developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources, including blogs such as Cinegolpo and newspapers such as Samakal and The Business Standard. Unlike single-domain resources, our dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. It offers greater adaptability and practical relevance. To establish strong baselines, we trained and evaluated this dataset using several deep learning and transfer learning models, including LSTM, BanglaT5-small, and MTS-small. The results highlight its potential as a benchmark for future research in Bangla natural language processing. This dataset provides a solid foundation for building robust summarization systems and helps expand NLP resources for low-resource languages.

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of reasoning traces, generated by large language models like DeepSeek-R1 and gpt-oss, on teaching reasoning capabilities to medium-sized LLMs for Math problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage reasoning traces produced by cutting-edge LLMs to improve the reasoning accuracy and efficiency of medium-sized LLMs without requiring costly human-curated supervision.

Method: The study post-trains medium-sized LLMs on two different sets of reasoning traces, one generated by DeepSeek-R1 and the other by gpt-oss, and evaluates their performance and efficiency in solving Math problems.

Result: The comparison highlights the differences in accuracy and inference efficiency of the medium-sized LLMs post-trained on reasoning traces from the two advanced models.

Conclusion: Post-training with high-quality reasoning traces from state-of-the-art LLMs can significantly enhance the reasoning abilities of medium-sized LLMs, offering a cost-efficient alternative to human-supervised training programs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling, which leverages additional computation during inference to improve model accuracy, has enabled a new class of Large Language Models (LLMs) that are able to reason through complex problems by understanding the goal, turning this goal into a plan, working through intermediate steps, and checking their own work before answering . Frontier large language models with reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's gpt-oss, follow the same procedure when solving complex problems by generating intermediate reasoning traces before giving the final answer. Today, these models are being increasingly used to generate reasoning traces that serve as high-quality supervised data for post-training of small and medium-sized language models to teach reasoning capabilities without requiring expensive human curation. In this work, we compare the performance of medium-sized LLMs on Math problems after post-training on two kinds of reasoning traces. We compare the impact of reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1 and gpt-oss LLMs in terms of accuracy and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER) to train models for realistic long-form research tasks and presents the DR Tulu-8B model, achieving superior performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research models are limited to short-form QA tasks and struggle with realistic long-form tasks due to inadequate training methods.

Method: Proposed RLER methodology constructs evolving rubrics that adapt with the model during training, enabling effective feedback for open-ended research.

Result: DR Tulu-8B outperforms existing open models and rivals proprietary systems across multiple benchmarks despite being smaller and cost-efficient.

Conclusion: RLER and DR Tulu-8B mark substantial progress in open long-form research systems and pave the way for future improvements with publicly available data and infrastructure.

Abstract: Deep research models perform multi-step research to produce long-form, well-attributed answers. However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback. Using RLER, we develop Deep Research Tulu (DR Tulu-8B), the first open model that is directly trained for open-ended, long-form deep research. Across four long-form deep research benchmarks in science, healthcare and general domains, DR Tulu substantially outperforms existing open deep research models, and matches or exceeds proprietary deep research systems, while being significantly smaller and cheaper per query. To facilitate future research, we release all data, models, and code, including our new MCP-based agent infrastructure for deep research systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of extending LLMs to deal with multimodal reasoning tasks without the high cost and rigidity of developing large-scale VLMs, while preserving efficiency and adaptability.

Method: The authors propose a modular, multi-agent framework called BeMyEyes, in which efficient, smaller VLMs act as perceivers and collaborate with powerful LLMs as reasoners. They introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning process to train the perceiver for effective collaboration.

Result: Using BeMyEyes, LLMs achieve state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning results. A lightweight implementation outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o in multimodal, knowledge-intensive tasks, proving the scalability and effectiveness of this approach.

Conclusion: BeMyEyes demonstrates a groundbreaking approach to enable cost-efficient and modular multimodal reasoning in LLMs while outperforming large proprietary models, showcasing its potential for future multimodal systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, modularity, and scalability of our multi-agent approach for building future multimodal reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores AI-based models for affordable body fat estimation using a unique dataset of images and anthropometric data, delivering promising accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make body fat percentage estimation more accessible and affordable as alternatives to costly methods like DEXA scans.

Method: AI-based model development using ResNet for images and regression models for anthropometric data; dataset compiled from Reddit posts.

Result: Image model achieved RMSE of 4.44% and R² of 0.807, proving feasibility for low-cost body fat estimation.

Conclusion: AI-assisted models can significantly enhance accessibility to body fat percentage estimation for general health and fitness purposes.

Abstract: Tracking body fat percentage is essential for effective weight management, yet gold-standard methods such as DEXA scans remain expensive and inaccessible for most people. This study evaluates the feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) models as low-cost alternatives using frontal body images and basic anthropometric data. The dataset consists of 535 samples: 253 cases with recorded anthropometric measurements (weight, height, neck, ankle, and wrist) and 282 images obtained via web scraping from Reddit posts with self-reported body fat percentages, including some reported as DEXA-derived by the original posters. Because no public datasets exist for computer-vision-based body fat estimation, this dataset was compiled specifically for this study. Two approaches were developed: (1) ResNet-based image models and (2) regression models using anthropometric measurements. A multimodal fusion framework is also outlined for future expansion once paired datasets become available. The image-based model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.44% and a Coefficient of Determination (R^2) of 0.807. These findings demonstrate that AI-assisted models can offer accessible and low-cost body fat estimates, supporting future consumer applications in health and fitness.

*Yassir Benhammou,Suman Kalyan,Sujay Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) to unify text, audio, and visual data for automated metadata extraction and semantic clustering in broadcast media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Broadcast and media organizations face issues with existing AI systems that work on a single modality, limiting their ability to understand complex relationships across text, audio, and visual data.

Method: The MMAE model learns unified representations by minimizing joint reconstruction losses across modalities, utilizing the LUMA dataset of multimodal triplets representative of real-world media content.

Result: MMAE significantly improves clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) over linear baselines, demonstrating more effective multimodal embeddings for metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval.

Conclusion: Reconstruction-driven multimodal learning offers scalable solutions for automation, searchability, and efficient content management in modern broadcast workflows.

Abstract: Broadcast and media organizations increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to automate the labor-intensive processes of content indexing, tagging, and metadata generation. However, existing AI systems typically operate on a single modality-such as video, audio, or text-limiting their understanding of complex, cross-modal relationships in broadcast material. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) that learns unified representations across text, audio, and visual data, enabling end-to-end automation of metadata extraction and semantic clustering. The model is trained on the recently introduced LUMA dataset, a fully aligned benchmark of multimodal triplets representative of real-world media content. By minimizing joint reconstruction losses across modalities, the MMAE discovers modality-invariant semantic structures without relying on large paired or contrastive datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) compared to linear baselines, indicating that reconstruction-based multimodal embeddings can serve as a foundation for scalable metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval in broadcast archives. These results highlight the potential of reconstruction-driven multimodal learning to enhance automation, searchability, and content management efficiency in modern broadcast workflows.

Motivation: To improve wildfire risk prediction by addressing limited availability of benchmark datasets with long-term temporal and spatial scope.

Method: The paper presents a large-scale wildfire dataset with 38 covariates and tests various time-series models, including CNN, linear, Transformer, and Mamba-based architectures.

Result: A benchmark dataset is developed, models are evaluated, and insights on fire-driving factors are revealed.

Conclusion: The dataset enables better modeling of wildfire risks, serving as a resource for researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Wildfire risk prediction remains a critical yet challenging task due to the complex interactions among fuel conditions, meteorology, topography, and human activity. Despite growing interest in data-driven approaches, publicly available benchmark datasets that support long-term temporal modeling, large-scale spatial coverage, and multimodal drivers remain scarce. To address this gap, we present a 25-year, daily-resolution wildfire dataset covering 240 million hectares across British Columbia and surrounding regions. The dataset includes 38 covariates, encompassing active fire detections, weather variables, fuel conditions, terrain features, and anthropogenic factors. Using this benchmark, we evaluate a diverse set of time-series forecasting models, including CNN-based, linear-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based architectures. We also investigate effectiveness of position embedding and the relative importance of different fire-driving factors.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SConvTransform, a Transform dialect extension for optimizing 2D convolutions in MLIR, achieving notable efficiency on ARM and Intel architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize 2D convolutions in machine learning intermediate representation (MLIR) using a systematic and declarative approach.

Method: The pipeline employs Convolution Slicing Analysis to determine tiling and data layout strategies, guiding the lowering of convolutions into tiled and packed generic operations.

Result: Experimental evaluations show the generated code achieves up to 60% of peak performance on ARM SME and 67% on Intel AVX512.

Conclusion: Results highlight the value of static analysis with structured tiling and packing, with future scope in performance improvements and support for additional targets.

Abstract: This paper proposes SConvTransform, a Transform dialect extension that provides operations for optimizing 2D convolutions in MLIR. Its main operation, SConvOp, lowers Linalg convolutions into tiled and packed generic operations through a fully declarative transformation pipeline. The process is guided by a Convolution Slicing Analysis that determines tile sizes and data layout strategies based on input and filter shapes, as well as target architecture parameters. SConvOp handles edge cases by splitting irregular regions and adjusting affine maps where needed. All packing and tiling operations are derived from a parametric set of affine equations, enabling reusable and analyzable transformations. Although functional correctness was the primary goal of this work, the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SConvTransform, achieving good enough performance across different target architectures. Future work will focus on optimizing performance and porting to other target devices. When applied to standard convolution configurations, the generated code achieves up to 60% of peak performance on ARM SME and 67% on Intel AVX512. These results validate the benefit of combining static shape analysis with structured tiling and packing strategies within the MLIR Transform dialect. Furthermore, the modular design of SConvTransform facilitates integration with future extensions, enabling continued optimization of convolution workloads through MLIR's extensible compilation infrastructure.

*Hyakka Nakada,Yoshiyasu Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores how document distortions, particularly perspective distortions, impact OCR data extraction by multi-modal LLMs like Gemini-1.5-pro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the challenges faced by multi-modal LLMs in OCR tasks when documents exhibit real-world distortions like in-plane rotations and perspective distortions.

Method: Researchers modeled perspective distortions using isosceles-trapezoidal transformations to simplify parameters, enabling experimentation with rotation angles and distortion ratios.

Result: While multi-modal LLMs showed degradation in accuracy, especially for structure-recognition, performance improved with simple rotational corrections.

Conclusion: The findings enhance practical OCR applications, showing how distortion corrections can mitigate accuracy issues for multi-modal LLMs in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction from documents is essential to intelligent informatics, such as digitizing medical records and recognizing road signs. Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks.

Abstract: Accurate 3D ground truth estimation is critical for applications such as autonomous navigation, surveillance, and robotics. This paper introduces a novel method that uses an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to fuse 2D bounding box or pose keypoint ground truth annotations from multiple calibrated cameras into accurate 3D ground truth. By leveraging human-annotated ground-truth 2D, our proposed method, a multi-camera single-object tracking algorithm, transforms 2D image coordinates into robust 3D world coordinates through homography-based projection and UKF-based fusion. Our proposed algorithm processes multi-view data to estimate object positions and shapes while effectively handling challenges such as occlusion. We evaluate our method on the CMC, Wildtrack, and Panoptic datasets, demonstrating high accuracy in 3D localization compared to the available 3D ground truth. Unlike existing approaches that provide only ground-plane information, our method also outputs the full 3D shape of each object. Additionally, the algorithm offers a scalable and fully automatic solution for multi-camera systems using only 2D image annotations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning model for enhancing low-light traffic images by addressing challenges like noise, motion blur, and non-uniform lighting to improve image visibility and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light traffic scenes reduce visibility and hinder critical tasks like object detection and scene understanding in domains like autonomous driving and urban surveillance.

Method: The approach involves a multi-stage deep learning framework with modules for illumination adaptation, reflectance restoration, and over-exposure compensation, trained using self-supervised and perceptual loss techniques.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various metrics (PSNR, SSIM, etc.) and visually enhances image quality while improving practical visibility in traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: This method effectively enhances low-light images, offering practical benefits for downstream perception tasks and real-world applications in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Enhancing low-light traffic images is crucial for reliable perception in autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and urban surveillance systems. Nighttime and dimly lit traffic scenes often suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare from vehicle headlights or street lamps, which hinder tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a fully unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for low-light traffic image enhancement. The model decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, progressively refined by three specialized modules: (1) Illumination Adaptation, for global and local brightness correction; (2) Reflectance Restoration, for noise suppression and structural detail recovery using spatial-channel attention; and (3) Over-Exposure Compensation, for reconstructing saturated regions and balancing scene luminance. The network is trained using self-supervised reconstruction, reflectance smoothness, perceptual consistency, and domain-aware regularization losses, eliminating the need for paired ground-truth images. Experiments on general and traffic-specific datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE) and qualitative visual quality. Our approach enhances visibility, preserves structure, and improves downstream perception reliability in real-world low-light traffic scenarios.

### [147] [HSMix: Hard and Soft Mixing Data Augmentation for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17614)
*Danyang Sun,Fadi Dornaika,Nagore Barrena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HSMix, a novel data augmentation technique for medical image segmentation using hard and soft mixing to address data scarcity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges in medical image segmentation due to data scarcity and overfitting, as annotation is costly and certain diseases are rare. Existing self-supervised and semi-supervised methods are complex, prompting the development of a simpler, effective alternative like data augmentation.

Method: HSMix generates augmented images by combining superpixel (homogeneous regions) information from two images for "hard" mixing, and adjusts brightness based on pixel-wise saliency coefficients for "soft" mixing. Corresponding segmentation masks undergo parallel mixing operations.

Result: The approach is shown to enhance diversity in the augmentation space, preserve local semantic information, and improve segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities and tasks.

Conclusion: HSMix is a simple, versatile, and effective plug-and-play method for enhancing medical image segmentation through advanced data augmentation. Its usefulness is evidenced by extensive experiments and available source code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotation or the rarity of some diseases, medical image segmentation is often limited by data scarcity and the resulting overfitting problem. Self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning can mitigate the data scarcity challenge to some extent. However, both of these paradigms are complex and require either hand-crafted pretexts or well-defined pseudo-labels. In contrast, data augmentation represents a relatively simple and straightforward approach to addressing data scarcity issues. It has led to significant improvements in image recognition tasks. However, the effectiveness of local image editing augmentation techniques in the context of segmentation has been less explored. We propose HSMix, a novel approach to local image editing data augmentation involving hard and soft mixing for medical semantic segmentation. In our approach, a hard-augmented image is created by combining homogeneous regions (superpixels) from two source images. A soft mixing method further adjusts the brightness of these composed regions with brightness mixing based on locally aggregated pixel-wise saliency coefficients. The ground-truth segmentation masks of the two source images undergo the same mixing operations to generate the associated masks for the augmented images. Our method fully exploits both the prior contour and saliency information, thus preserving local semantic information in the augmented images while enriching the augmentation space with more diversity. Our method is a plug-and-play solution that is model agnostic and applicable to a range of medical imaging modalities. Extensive experimental evidence has demonstrated its effectiveness in a variety of medical segmentation tasks. The source code is available in https://github.com/DanielaPlusPlus/HSMix.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel, tuning-free method (PnP-MIX) for integrating multiple personalized concepts into a single generated image while maintaining compositional fidelity and addressing issues like concept leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for text-to-image generation struggle with multi-concept and complex scenes due to unintended changes and semantic inconsistencies in images.

Method: The authors introduce PnP-MIX, a method leveraging guided appearance attention, mask-guided noise mixing, and background dilution++ to integrate personalized concepts accurately into T2I generation.

Result: PnP-MIX outperforms existing methods in single- and multi-concept personalization, maintaining high fidelity and robustness without requiring additional model tuning.

Conclusion: PnP-MIX enhances text-to-image synthesis by accurately embedding personalized concepts while preserving image structure and preventing concept leakage, setting a new benchmark for T2I personalization.

Abstract: Integrating multiple personalized concepts into a single image has recently become a significant area of focus within Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods often underperform on complex multi-object scenes due to unintended alterations in both personalized and non-personalized regions. This not only fails to preserve the intended prompt structure but also disrupts interactions among regions, leading to semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce plug-and-play multi-concept adaptive blending for high-fidelity text-to-image synthesis (PnP-MIX), an innovative, tuning-free approach designed to seamlessly embed multiple personalized concepts into a single generated image. Our method leverages guided appearance attention to faithfully reflect the intended appearance of each personalized concept. To further enhance compositional fidelity, we present a mask-guided noise mixing strategy that preserves the integrity of non-personalized regions such as the background or unrelated objects while enabling the precise integration of personalized objects. Finally, to mitigate concept leakage, i.e., the inadvertent leakage of personalized concept features into other regions, we propose background dilution++, a novel strategy that effectively reduces such leakage and promotes accurate localization of features within personalized regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PnP-MIX consistently surpasses existing methodologies in both single- and multi-concept personalization scenarios, underscoring its robustness and superior performance without additional model tuning.

*Ju-Young Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called FIQ, which improves VQA models by generating Q&A pairs from key video attributes, enhancing reasoning and comprehension abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods are restricted by event-centric annotations and lack contextual understanding due to missing foundational attributes.

Method: FIQ generates foundational Q&A pairs based on descriptive visual attributes and includes a VQ-CAlign module for improved contextual alignment.

Result: FIQ achieved state-of-the-art results on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: The FIQ framework enhances VQA models by fostering a deeper contextual understanding of video content and improves generalizability and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Conventional VQA approaches primarily rely on question-answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics of video content. However, most existing annotations are event-centric, which restricts the model's ability to capture the comprehensive context of a scene. The lack of fundamental information such as object categories, spatial configurations, and descriptive visual attributes prevents the model from forming a complete understanding of the environment, ultimately limiting its generalization and reasoning capability. In this paper, we introduce Foundational Question Generation for Video Question Answering via an Embedding-Integrated Approach (FIQ), a framework designed to enhance the reasoning capability of VQA models by improving their foundational comprehension of video content. FIQ generates Q&A pairs from descriptive information extracted directly from videos, thereby enriching the dataset with core scene-level attributes. These generated pairs help the model develop a more holistic understanding of the video, leading to improved generalizability and reasoning performance. In addition, we propose a VQ-CAlign module that aligns task-specific question embeddings with corresponding visual features, preserving essential contextual cues and enhancing adaptability to downstream tasks. Experimental results on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset demonstrate that FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baseline approaches.

### [150] [Rethinking the Encoding and Annotating of 3D Bounding Box: Corner-Aware 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17619)
*Qinghao Meng,Junbo Yin,Jianbing Shen,Yunde Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a corner-aligned regression strategy for LiDAR-based 3D object detection, improving accuracy and offering a weakly supervised approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current center-aligned regression approach in LiDAR 3D detection is unstable due to sparse or empty regions at object centers in BEV caused by the front-surface-biased nature of LiDAR data.

Method: The authors propose shifting the prediction focus from object centers to corners, which are more geometrically stable and observable. They design a corner-aware detection head and leverage weak supervision methods using corner annotations instead of full 3D labels.

Result: Experiments on the KITTI dataset show a 3.5% AP performance improvement over a center-based baseline. The method achieves 83% of fully supervised detection accuracy using only corner annotations.

Conclusion: Corner-aligned regression provides a robust alternative to traditional center-based methods in LiDAR detection, improving performance and reducing dependency on full 3D annotations.

Abstract: Center-aligned regression remains dominant in LiDAR-based 3D object detection, yet it suffers from fundamental instability: object centers often fall in sparse or empty regions of the bird's-eye-view (BEV) due to the front-surface-biased nature of LiDAR point clouds, leading to noisy and inaccurate bounding box predictions. To circumvent this limitation, we revisit bounding box representation and propose corner-aligned regression, which shifts the prediction target from unstable centers to geometrically informative corners that reside in dense, observable regions. Leveraging the inherent geometric constraints among corners and image 2D boxes, partial parameters of 3D bounding boxes can be recovered from corner annotations, enabling a weakly supervised paradigm without requiring complete 3D labels. We design a simple yet effective corner-aware detection head that can be plugged into existing detectors. Experiments on KITTI show our method improves performance by 3.5% AP over center-based baseline, and achieves 83% of fully supervised accuracy using only BEV corner clicks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our corner-aware regression strategy.

Motivation: To overcome challenges in extreme quantization and training stability within lightweight architectures using BNNs, particularly depth-wise convolutions, while aiming for improved efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Introduces a 1.58-bit convolution for expressiveness and pre-BN residual connection for stabilizing optimization and addressing the Hessian condition number. Applies these modifications to binarize depth-wise convolutions.

Result: Achieved 33M OPs with MobileNet V1 on ImageNet, establishing state-of-the-art performance for BNNs. Demonstrated consistent accuracy improvements across multiple datasets, up to 9.3 percentage points.

Conclusion: The proposed approach represents a breakthrough in BNNs by successfully binarizing depth-wise convolutions and achieving high efficiency and accuracy, setting a new benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in model compression have highlighted the potential of low-bit precision techniques, with Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) attracting attention for their extreme efficiency. However, extreme quantization in BNNs limits representational capacity and destabilizes training, posing significant challenges for lightweight architectures with depth-wise convolutions. To address this, we propose a 1.58-bit convolution to enhance expressiveness and a pre-BN residual connection to stabilize optimization by improving the Hessian condition number. These innovations enable, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful binarization of depth-wise convolutions in BNNs. Our method achieves 33M OPs on ImageNet with MobileNet V1, establishing a new state-of-the-art in BNNs by outperforming prior methods with comparable OPs. Moreover, it consistently outperforms existing methods across various datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Tiny ImageNet, and Oxford Flowers 102, with accuracy improvements of up to 9.3 percentage points.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to optimize score-based diffusion models using the Fokker-Planck formulation and cross-matrix Krylov projection method, achieving significant time and computational efficiency for image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost associated with solving large linear systems in stable diffusion models during image generation.

Method: The method involves converting stable diffusion models into the Fokker-Planck formulation and implementing a cross-matrix Krylov projection technique that leverages shared subspaces from seed matrices to efficiently solve target matrices.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates a 15.8% to 43.7% time reduction over sparse solvers, up to 115x speedup over DDPM baselines, and successfully generates high-quality images in under fixed computational budgets.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for accelerating score-based diffusion models and provides practical benefits for image generation in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate score-based diffusion models. It first converts the standard stable diffusion model into the Fokker-Planck formulation which results in solving large linear systems for each image. For training involving many images, it can lead to a high computational cost. The core innovation is a cross-matrix Krylov projection method that exploits mathematical similarities between matrices, using a shared subspace built from ``seed" matrices to rapidly solve for subsequent ``target" matrices. Our experiments show that this technique achieves a 15.8\% to 43.7\% time reduction over standard sparse solvers. Additionally, we compare our method against DDPM baselines in denoising tasks, showing a speedup of up to 115$\times$. Furthermore, under a fixed computational budget, our model is able to produce high-quality images while DDPM fails to generate recognizable content, illustrating our approach is a practical method for efficient generation in resource-limited settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel augmentation strategy called Upstream Probabilistic Meta-Imputation (UPMI) to improve machine learning performance in diagnosing pediatric pancreatitis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pediatric pancreatitis poses significant diagnostic challenges due to limited data availability and complex multimodal imaging, hindering advancements in machine learning diagnostics.

Method: The UPMI strategy uses probability outputs from modality-specific logistic regressions transformed into a meta-feature vector. Gaussian mixture models are used to generate synthetic meta-features, which are combined with real data to train a Random Forest meta-classifier.

Result: UPMI achieved a mean AUC of 0.908 ± 0.072 on a dataset of 67 pediatric T1W/T2W MRI subjects, demonstrating a ~5% improvement over baseline models.

Conclusion: UPMI improves diagnostic accuracy in pediatric pancreatitis by augmenting low-dimensional meta-feature spaces, making it a promising approach for applications with limited data.

Abstract: Pediatric pancreatitis is a progressive and debilitating inflammatory condition, including acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis, that presents significant clinical diagnostic challenges. Machine learning-based methods also face diagnostic challenges due to limited sample availability and multimodal imaging complexity. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Upstream Probabilistic Meta-Imputation (UPMI), a light-weight augmentation strategy that operates upstream of a meta-learner in a low-dimensional meta-feature space rather than in image space. Modality-specific logistic regressions (T1W and T2W MRI radiomics) produce probability outputs that are transformed into a 7-dimensional meta-feature vector. Class-conditional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are then fit within each cross-validation fold to sample synthetic meta-features that, combined with real meta-features, train a Random Forest (RF) meta-classifier. On 67 pediatric subjects with paired T1W/T2W MRIs, UPMI achieves a mean AUC of 0.908 $\pm$ 0.072, a $\sim$5% relative gain over a real-only baseline (AUC 0.864 $\pm$ 0.061).

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for improving Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection by refining activations into a channel-aware typical set and mitigating distributional skewness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe deployment of machine learning models in open-world environments by improving OOD detection methods.

Method: Proposes a channel-aware typical set refinement based on discriminability and activity, introduces skewness-based refinement, and uses rectified activations to compute energy score.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection and generalizes well across backbones and score functions, validated on ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-100 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Refining activations can address limitations in existing OOD detection approaches, improving model reliability in open-world environments.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a critical capability for ensuring the safe deployment of machine learning models in open-world environments, where unexpected or anomalous inputs can compromise model reliability and performance. Activation-based methods play a fundamental role in OOD detection by mitigating anomalous activations and enhancing the separation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. However, existing methods apply activation rectification while often overlooking channel's intrinsic characteristics and distributional skewness, which results in inaccurate typical set estimation. This discrepancy can lead to the improper inclusion of anomalous activations across channels. To address this limitation, we propose a typical set refinement method based on discriminability and activity, which rectifies activations into a channel-aware typical set. Furthermore, we introduce a skewness-based refinement to mitigate distributional bias in typical set estimation. Finally, we leverage the rectified activations to compute the energy score for OOD detection. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-100 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes effectively across backbones and score functions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWITCH proposes a benchmark to evaluate AI models on task-based interactions with tangible control interfaces in everyday environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating AI systems on grounding, partial observability, and post-hoc verification in task-driven, real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces SWITCH, an iterative benchmark focused on key abilities such as task-aware VQA, semantic grounding, action generation, and more, using egocentric RGB video input across a dataset of diverse devices.

Result: SWITCH-Basic revealed inconsistent performance of large multi-modal models (LMMMs), showing over-reliance on textual data rather than visual evidence.

Conclusion: SWITCH aims to guide the development of more robust, embodied AI systems for practical world interactions by providing a reproducible, extensible evaluation framework.

Abstract: Autonomous intelligence requires not only perception and reasoning, but critically, effective interaction with the existing world and its infrastructure. Everyday environments are rich in tangible control interfaces (TCIs), e.g., light switches, appliance panels, and embedded GUIs, that demand commonsense and physics reasoning, but also causal prediction and outcome verification in time and space (e.g., delayed heating, remote lights). Moreover, failures here have potential safety implications, yet current benchmarks rarely test grounding, partial observability (video), or post-hoc verification in situated settings. We introduce SWITCH (Semantic World Interface Tasks for Control and Handling), an embodied, task-driven benchmark created through iterative releases to probe these gaps. Its first iteration, SWITCH-Basic, evaluates five complementary abilities:task-aware VQA, semantic UI grounding, action generation, state-transition prediction, and result verification, under egocentric RGB video input and device diversity. Across 351 tasks spanning 98 real devices and appliances, commercial and open LMMMs exhibit inconsistent performance even on single-step interactions, often over-relying on textual cues and under-using visual or video evidence (and high aggregate scores can mask such failures). SWITCH provides data, code, and held-out splits to enable reproducible evaluation and community contributions toward more challenging future iterations of the benchmark and the creation of training datasets.

Method: Evaluated six neural network models (VGG-16, Inception V3, ResNet-50, Inception-ResNet V2, Xception, and a custom CNN) with consistent preprocessing, optimized protocols, and explanation techniques like Grad-CAM and GradientShap.

Result: The custom CNN achieved 96.49% accuracy with real-time inference capability, while Inception-ResNet V2 reached 99.53% accuracy with state-of-the-art precision, recall, and F1-scores. All models were robustly validated using multiple metrics.

Conclusion: This solution provides a deployable, interpretable, and accurate AI framework suitable for clinical applications in both advanced and low-resource healthcare systems.

The study moves the needle forward in a number of ways, including (1) full standardization of assessment with respect to preprocessing, training sets/protocols (optimizing networks with the AdamW optimizer, CosineAnnealingLR, patiene for early stopping = 7), and metrics to assess performance were identical along all models; (2) a high level of confidence in the localizations based on prior studies as both Grad-CAM and GradientShap explanation were used to establish anatomically important and meaningful attention regions and address the black-box issue; (3) a compact 1.31 million parameter CNN was developed that achieved 96.49% testing accuracy and was 100 times smaller than Inception-ResNet V2 while permitting real-time inference (375ms) on edge devices; (4) full evaluation beyond accuracy reporting based on measures of intersection over union, Hausdorff distance, and precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices across all splits. Inception-ResNet V2 reached state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 99.53% accuracy on testing and obtaining a precision, recall, and F1-score of at least 99.50% dominant performance based on metrics of recent studies. We demonstrated a lightweight model that is suitable to deploy on devices that do not have multi-GPU infrastructure in under-resourced settings. This end-to-end solution considers accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of trustworthy AI to create the framework necessary for performance assessment and deployment within advance and low-resource healthcare systems to an extent that enabled participation at the clinical screening and triage level.

TL;DR: MedPEFT-CL is a framework for continual learning in medical vision-language tasks, addressing catastrophic forgetting through efficient parameter tuning and knowledge consolidation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical vision-language models struggle with catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new tasks, making continual learning essential for clinical applications.

Method: MedPEFT-CL uses a dual-phase architecture involving adaptive learning through semantic similarity-based adapter allocation and knowledge consolidation through Fisher-memory coordination.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior retention of prior task performance and forgetting mitigation across diverse medical datasets while using minimal trainable parameters.

Conclusion: MedPEFT-CL effectively addresses efficient continual learning challenges, enabling consistent performance across new and previous medical tasks for clinical applicability.

Abstract: Medical vision-language segmentation models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new anatomical structures, requiring complete retraining that limits their clinical deployment. Although continual learning approaches have been studied for various applications, targeted research on continual learning approaches specifically designed for medical vision-language tasks remains underexplored. We propose MedPEFT-CL, a parameter-efficient continual learning framework that addresses both efficient learning of new tasks and preservation of previous knowledge through a dual-phase architecture based on CLIPSeg. Our dual-phase architecture features an adaptive learning phase that employs semantic similarity-based adapter allocation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for medical tasks through prompt similarity analysis, and a knowledge consolidation phase employing bi-directional Fisher-memory coordination. This creates a reinforcing cycle: consolidation directs replay priorities while new tasks provide challenging samples that improve retention strategies. Our key contributions are: (1) a semantic-driven adapter allocation mechanism that enables efficient learning of new medical tasks, (2) a bi-modal LoRA adaptation that significantly reduces trainable parameters while maintaining cross-modal learning, and (3) bidirectional Fisher-memory coordination that prevents catastrophic forgetting from previous medical tasks. Extensive experiments across diverse medical datasets demonstrate superior forgetting mitigation and performance retention with minimal parameter overhead, making the framework effective for continual learning in medical vision-language scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper introduces VMRMOT, a framework for Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) that incorporates motion modality for better alignment and performance in tracking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RMOT benchmarks ignore dynamic motion changes, which limit tracking performance and create discrepancies between static references and dynamic vision modalities.

Method: VMRMOT uses multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to extract motion features and introduces a Vision-Motion-Reference Alignment (VMRA) module and Motion-Guided Prediction Head (MGPH) to enhance alignment between modalities.

Result: VMRMOT achieved superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple RMOT benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating motion-aware modalities and leveraging MLLMs significantly improve RMOT tasks by aligning vision, motion, and reference cues dynamically.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) extends conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) by introducing natural language references for multi-modal fusion tracking. RMOT benchmarks only describe the object's appearance, relative positions, and initial motion states. This so-called static regulation fails to capture dynamic changes of the object motion, including velocity changes and motion direction shifts. This limitation not only causes a temporal discrepancy between static references and dynamic vision modality but also constrains multi-modal tracking performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Vision-Motion-Reference aligned RMOT framework, named VMRMOT. It integrates a motion modality extracted from object dynamics to enhance the alignment between vision modality and language references through multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we introduce motion-aware descriptions derived from object dynamic behaviors and, leveraging the powerful temporal-reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, extract motion features as the motion modality. We further design a Vision-Motion-Reference Alignment (VMRA) module to hierarchically align visual queries with motion and reference cues, enhancing their cross-modal consistency. In addition, a Motion-Guided Prediction Head (MGPH) is developed to explore motion modality to enhance the performance of the prediction head. To the best of our knowledge, VMRMOT is the first approach to employ MLLMs in the RMOT task for vision-reference alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple RMOT benchmarks demonstrate that VMRMOT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs and LVLMs process numerical information during counting tasks, revealing layerwise numerical representation and internal counting mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how LLMs and LVLMs encode numerical information during counting tasks and uncover their mechanistic processes.

Method: Controlled experiments with repeated textual/visual items combined with causal mediation, activation patching, and the use of a specialized tool called CountScope.

Result: Numerical representations progressively emerge across layers; counting is stored in final tokens/regions and is influenced by structural shortcuts like separators in text or spatial composition in visual embeddings.

Conclusion: Counting is a structured, layerwise process in LLMs/LVLMs influenced by their design and encoder properties, with numerical content extracted and transferable across contexts.

Abstract: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) represent and compute numerical information in counting tasks. We use controlled experiments with repeated textual and visual items and analyze model behavior through causal mediation and activation patching. To this end, we design a specialized tool, CountScope, for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content. Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions. Overall, counting emerges as a structured, layerwise process in LLMs and follows the same general pattern in LVLMs, shaped by the properties of the vision encoder.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates counting accuracy of Vision Language Models (VLMs), identifying biases and testing improvements using synthetic benchmarks and attention interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the counting capabilities of VLMs, addressing their reliance on biases and struggles with visual and linguistic complexity.

Method: Synthetic dataset creation, evaluation framework, analysis of attention allocation in open-source VLMs based on various image and prompt properties, and application of attention-based interventions.

Result: Experiments showed that counting remains a challenging task for VLMs, particularly with high complexity; however, attention adjustments offer slight improvement.

Conclusion: Attention modulation can improve VLM counting performance modestly, but the issue remains largely unsolved under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Recent research suggests that Vision Language Models (VLMs) often rely on inherent biases learned during training when responding to queries about visual properties of images. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly specific questions that require them to focus on particular areas of the image in tasks such as counting. We build upon this research by developing a synthetic benchmark dataset and evaluation framework to systematically determine how counting performance varies as image and prompt properties change. Using open-source VLMs, we then analyze how attention allocation fluctuates with varying input parameters (e.g. number of objects in the image, objects color, background color, objects texture, background texture, and prompt specificity). We further implement attention-based interventions to modulate focus on visual tokens at different layers and evaluate their impact on counting performance across a range of visual conditions. Our experiments reveal that while VLM counting performance remains challenging, especially under high visual or linguistic complexity, certain attention interventions can lead to modest gains in counting performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading global cause of death, necessitating reliable vascular segmentation in X-ray angiography for better clinical decisions while addressing domain shifts and annotated data limitations.

Method: A channel regularization strategy that reweights feature channels to amplify domain-invariant features and attenuate domain-specific ones, enhancing interpretability and generalization.

Result: AngioDG was tested on 6 angiography datasets, showing superior out-of-distribution performance while maintaining consistent in-domain results.

Conclusion: AngioDG is effective in handling domain generalization for XCA vessel segmentation, improving performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, with X-ray Coronary Angiography (XCA) as the gold standard during real-time cardiac interventions. Segmentation of coronary vessels from XCA can facilitate downstream quantitative assessments, such as measurement of the stenosis severity and enhancing clinical decision-making. However, developing generalizable vessel segmentation models for XCA is challenging due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics that cause domain shifts. These limitations are exacerbated by the lack of annotated datasets, making Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) a necessary solution for achieving generalization. Existing SDG methods are largely augmentation-based, which may not guarantee the mitigation of overfitting to augmented or synthetic domains. We propose a novel approach, ``AngioDG", to bridge this gap by channel regularization strategy to promote generalization. Our method identifies the contributions of early feature channels to task-specific metrics for DG, facilitating interpretability, and then reweights channels to calibrate and amplify domain-invariant features while attenuating domain-specific ones. We evaluate AngioDG on 6 x-ray angiography datasets for coronary vessels segmentation, achieving the best out-of-distribution performance among the compared methods, while maintaining consistent in-domain test performance.

TL;DR: This paper assesses the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for stroke rehabilitation data analysis but finds limitations in motion understanding, with some potential in high-level task classification and dose estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the feasibility of using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for addressing data-driven challenges in stroke rehabilitation, specifically in rehabilitation dose and impairment quantification.

Method: The authors formulated the problems as motion-identification tasks and evaluated their approach on a group of 29 healthy controls and 51 stroke survivors using VLMs with optimized prompting and post-processing.

Result: VLMs currently lack the ability for precise motion understanding. Rehabilitation dose estimates were similar to a baseline without visual data, and impairment scores were unreliable. However, VLMs showed promise in classifying high-level activities and approximate dose estimation with some accuracy.

Conclusion: While Vision-Language Models show some potential in data-driven stroke rehabilitation, they are currently limited in fine-grained motion analysis. Further optimization may unlock broader clinical applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of computer-vision tasks, sparking interest in their potential for digital health applications. Here, we apply VLMs to two fundamental challenges in data-driven stroke rehabilitation: automatic quantification of rehabilitation dose and impairment from videos. We formulate these problems as motion-identification tasks, which can be addressed using VLMs. We evaluate our proposed framework on a cohort of 29 healthy controls and 51 stroke survivors. Our results show that current VLMs lack the fine-grained motion understanding required for precise quantification: dose estimates are comparable to a baseline that excludes visual information, and impairment scores cannot be reliably predicted. Nevertheless, several findings suggest future promise. With optimized prompting and post-processing, VLMs can classify high-level activities from a few frames, detect motion and grasp with moderate accuracy, and approximate dose counts within 25% of ground truth for mildly impaired and healthy participants, all without task-specific training or finetuning. These results highlight both the current limitations and emerging opportunities of VLMs for data-driven stroke rehabilitation and broader clinical video analysis.

*Lingxiao Li,Yifan Wang,Xinyan Gao,Chen Tang,Xiangyu Yue,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisReason introduces a large-scale dataset for enhancing visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), improving their interpretability and cross-benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale datasets capturing rich, spatially grounded reasoning for MLLMs, enabling better visual understanding.

Method: VisReason dataset with 489K samples and VisReason-Pro subset (165K samples) annotated with expert reasoning traces and 3D spatial grounding; fine-tuning on state-of-the-art models.

Result: Fine-tuned models on VisReason and VisReason-Pro showed significant improvements in visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and generalization.

Conclusion: VisReason enhances systematic and human-like visual reasoning in MLLMs, aiding the progress toward advanced multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven remarkably effective for eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its potential in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains largely untapped, hindered by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the rich, spatially grounded reasoning intrinsic to visual understanding. Existing visual-CoT resources are typically small, domain-specific, or lack the human-like stepwise structure necessary for compositional visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisReason, a large-scale dataset designed to advance visual Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VisReason comprises 489K annotated examples spanning four diverse domains, each featuring multi-round, human-like rationales that guide MLLMs through interpretable visual reasoning steps. Building upon this, we curate VisReason-Pro, a 165K subset produced with a stronger expert-level GPT annotator, enriched with detailed reasoning traces and 3D spatial grounding via depth-informed annotations. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art Qwen2.5-VL model on VisReason and VisReason-Pro yields substantial improvements in step-by-step visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and cross-benchmark generalization. These results demonstrate that VisReason equips MLLMs with more systematic and generalizable reasoning capabilities. We envision VisReason as a cornerstone for cultivating human-like visual reasoning, paving the way toward the next generation of multimodal intelligence.

### [165] [Towards Open-Ended Visual Scientific Discovery with Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17735)
*Samuel Stevens,Jacob Beattie,Tanya Berger-Wolf,Yu Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for open-ended discovery of patterns from foundation model representations, demonstrating their effectiveness in both controlled tests and ecological imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of systematically discovering unknown patterns in large scientific datasets, which traditional methods limited to pre-specified targets cannot achieve.

Method: The authors propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to explore feature discovery in foundation model representations and evaluate their method in rediscovery studies, segmentation benchmarks, and ecological imagery analysis.

Result: The SAE approach successfully aligns with semantic concepts, improves concept-alignment metrics compared to alternatives, and uncovers fine-grained structure in ecological imagery without relying on segmentation labels.

Conclusion: Sparse autoencoders offer a domain-agnostic tool for exploring the knowledge embedded in scientific foundation models, paving the way for open-ended discovery in diverse disciplines beyond confirmation tasks.

Abstract: Scientific archives now contain hundreds of petabytes of data across genomics, ecology, climate, and molecular biology that could reveal undiscovered patterns if systematically analyzed at scale. Large-scale, weakly-supervised datasets in language and vision have driven the development of foundation models whose internal representations encode structure (patterns, co-occurrences and statistical regularities) beyond their training objectives. Most existing methods extract structure only for pre-specified targets; they excel at confirmation but do not support open-ended discovery of unknown patterns. We ask whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can enable open-ended feature discovery from foundation model representations. We evaluate this question in controlled rediscovery studies, where the learned SAE features are tested for alignment with semantic concepts on a standard segmentation benchmark and compared against strong label-free alternatives on concept-alignment metrics. Applied to ecological imagery, the same procedure surfaces fine-grained anatomical structure without access to segmentation or part labels, providing a scientific case study with ground-truth validation. While our experiments focus on vision with an ecology case study, the method is domain-agnostic and applicable to models in other sciences (e.g., proteins, genomics, weather). Our results indicate that sparse decomposition provides a practical instrument for exploring what scientific foundation models have learned, an important prerequisite for moving from confirmation to genuine discovery.

### [166] [AEGIS: Preserving privacy of 3D Facial Avatars with Adversarial Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17747)
*Dawid Wolkiewicz,Anastasiya Pechko,Przemysław Spurek,Piotr Syga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AEGIS is a framework for privacy-preserving 3D Gaussian avatars, reducing identity verification accuracy to 0% while maintaining high perceptual quality and preserving facial attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photorealistic 3D avatars create risks of identity theft, especially in biometric authentication systems, necessitating viewpoint-consistent identity masking solutions.

Method: AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to Gaussian color coefficients based on pre-trained face verification models, ensuring viewpoint consistency without altering avatar geometry.

Result: The framework achieves complete de-identification (0% face verification accuracy) while maintaining perceptual realism (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB) and preserving attributes like age, race, gender, and emotion.

Conclusion: AEGIS offers a novel, highly effective approach to identity masking for 3D Gaussian avatars that balances stringent privacy protection with minimal visual distortion.

Abstract: The growing adoption of photorealistic 3D facial avatars, particularly those utilizing efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, introduces new risks of online identity theft, especially in systems that rely on biometric authentication. While effective adversarial masking methods have been developed for 2D images, a significant gap remains in achieving robust, viewpoint-consistent identity protection for dynamic 3D avatars. To address this, we present AEGIS, the first privacy-preserving identity masking framework for 3D Gaussian Avatars that maintains the subject's perceived characteristics. Our method aims to conceal identity-related facial features while preserving the avatar's perceptual realism and functional integrity. AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to the Gaussian color coefficients, guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying the avatar's geometry. AEGIS achieves complete de-identification, reducing face retrieval and verification accuracy to 0%, while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB). It also preserves key facial attributes such as age, race, gender, and emotion, demonstrating strong privacy protection with minimal visual distortion.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPIDER, a universal framework for better feature matching in diverse settings, addressing challenges in conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature matching across domains like aerial, indoor, and outdoor scenes in the presence of large variations in appearance, scale, and viewpoint.

Method: Introduced SPIDER, combining a unified backbone and specialized network heads for extracting both 2D and 3D correspondences and tested it on a new benchmark for unconstrained scenarios.

Result: SPIDER outperformed state-of-the-art methods in universal image-matching scenarios with large baselines.

Conclusion: SPIDER proves its strong capability as a universal feature-matching framework, overcoming the limitations of existing methods in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable image correspondences form the foundation of vision-based spatial perception, enabling recovery of 3D structure and camera poses. However, unconstrained feature matching across domains such as aerial, indoor, and outdoor scenes remains challenging due to large variations in appearance, scale and viewpoint. Feature matching has been conventionally formulated as a 2D-to-2D problem; however, recent 3D foundation models provides spatial feature matching properties based on two-view geometry. While powerful, we observe that these spatially coherent matches often concentrate on dominant planar regions, e.g., walls or ground surfaces, while being less sensitive to fine-grained geometric details, particularly under large viewpoint changes. To better understand these trade-offs, we first perform linear probe experiments to evaluate the performance of various vision foundation models for image matching. Building on these insights, we introduce SPIDER, a universal feature matching framework that integrates a shared feature extraction backbone with two specialized network heads for estimating both 2D-based and 3D-based correspondences from coarse to fine. Finally, we introduce an image-matching evaluation benchmark that focuses on unconstrained scenarios with large baselines. SPIDER significantly outperforms SoTA methods, demonstrating its strong ability as a universal image-matching method.

*Prantik Howlader,Hoang Nguyen-Canh,Srijan Das,Jingyi Xu,Hieu Le,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents CORA, a semi-supervised framework for reasoning-based segmentation, which combines limited labeled data and a large corpus of unlabeled images. It introduces three novel components and achieves state-of-the-art results with minimal annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of limited generalization in reasoning segmentation tasks caused by the high cost of curating precise data annotations paired with linguistic supervision.

Method: CORA employs a semi-supervised learning approach with three key innovations: conditional visual instructions to encode object relationships, a pseudo-label filter that ensures outputs from multimodal models are consistent, and token-level contrastive alignment between labeled and pseudo-labeled data for feature consistency.

Result: CORA outperforms existing baselines under limited annotation settings. Specifically, it achieves a $+2.3\%$ improvement on Cityscapes with only 100 labeled images and a $+2.4\%$ boost on PanNuke with 180 labeled images.

Conclusion: CORA demonstrates that it is possible to achieve robust reasoning segmentation with minimal supervision, making it suitable for applications with constrained annotation resources.

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation seeks pixel-accurate masks for targets referenced by complex, often implicit instructions, requiring context-dependent reasoning over the scene. Recent multimodal language models have advanced instruction following segmentation, yet generalization remains limited. The key bottleneck is the high cost of curating diverse, high-quality pixel annotations paired with rich linguistic supervision leading to brittle performance under distribution shift. Therefore, we present CORA, a semi-supervised reasoning segmentation framework that jointly learns from limited labeled data and a large corpus of unlabeled images. CORA introduces three main components: 1) conditional visual instructions that encode spatial and contextual relationships between objects; 2) a noisy pseudo-label filter based on the consistency of Multimodal LLM's outputs across semantically equivalent queries; and 3) a token-level contrastive alignment between labeled and pseudo-labeled samples to enhance feature consistency. These components enable CORA to perform robust reasoning segmentation with minimal supervision, outperforming existing baselines under constrained annotation settings. CORA achieves state-of-the-art results, requiring as few as 100 labeled images on Cityscapes, a benchmark dataset for urban scene understanding, surpassing the baseline by $+2.3\%$. Similarly, CORA improves performance by $+2.4\%$ with only 180 labeled images on PanNuke, a histopathology dataset.

### [169] [Latent Dirichlet Transformer VAE for Hyperspectral Unmixing with Bundled Endmembers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17757)
*Giancarlo Giannetti,Faisal Z. Qureshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LDVAE-T, a model for hyperspectral unmixing combining transformer networks and Dirichlet prior constraints to improve abundance estimation and endmember extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images face challenges due to spectral mixing, obscuring material identification. The study aims to address this issue by enhancing the accuracy of hyperspectral unmixing using advanced modeling approaches.

Method: LDVAE-T combines transformers for global feature modeling with Dirichlet priors to impose sum-to-one and non-negativity constraints, using a decoder that predicts mean spectra and covariance structures alongside learned abundances.

Result: The LDVAE-T model demonstrated superior performance in abundance estimation and endmember extraction when tested on Samson, Jasper Ridge, and HYDICE Urban datasets.

Conclusion: LDVAE-T advances hyperspectral unmixing by modeling endmembers as bundles with structured variability and showcasing improved accuracy over existing methods.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images capture rich spectral information that enables per-pixel material identification; however, spectral mixing often obscures pure material signatures. To address this challenge, we propose the Latent Dirichlet Transformer Variational Autoencoder (LDVAE-T) for hyperspectral unmixing. Our model combines the global context modeling capabilities of transformer architectures with physically meaningful constraints imposed by a Dirichlet prior in the latent space. This prior naturally enforces the sum-to-one and non-negativity conditions essential for abundance estimation, thereby improving the quality of predicted mixing ratios. A key contribution of LDVAE-T is its treatment of materials as bundled endmembers, rather than relying on fixed ground truth spectra. In the proposed method our decoder predicts, for each endmember and each patch, a mean spectrum together with a structured (segmentwise) covariance that captures correlated spectral variability. Reconstructions are formed by mixing these learned bundles with Dirichlet-distributed abundances garnered from a transformer encoder, allowing the model to represent intrinsic material variability while preserving physical interpretability. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, Samson, Jasper Ridge, and HYDICE Urban and show that LDVAE-T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in abundance estimation and endmember extraction, as measured by root mean squared error and spectral angle distance, respectively.

*Mansur Yerzhanuly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares CNNs and ViTs for detecting AI-generated satellite images, finding ViTs superior in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the growing threat of deepfake generative models compromising the reliability of satellite imagery used in scientific and security domains.

Method: The researchers tested CNNs and ViTs on a dataset of 130,000 labeled RGB satellite images, employing architecture-specific interpretability methods for enhanced transparency.

Result: ViTs achieved a notable accuracy of 95.11% compared to CNNs' 87.02%, demonstrating better detection of synthetic imagery inconsistencies.

Conclusion: ViTs outperform CNNs in identifying deepfake satellite images, offering a more reliable tool for safeguarding high-stakes applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models such as StyleGAN2 and Stable Diffusion poses a growing threat to the authenticity of satellite imagery, which is increasingly vital for reliable analysis and decision-making across scientific and security domains. While deepfake detection has been extensively studied in facial contexts, satellite imagery presents distinct challenges, including terrain-level inconsistencies and structural artifacts. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) for detecting AI-generated satellite images. Using a curated dataset of over 130,000 labeled RGB images from the DM-AER and FSI datasets, we show that ViTs significantly outperform CNNs in both accuracy (95.11 percent vs. 87.02 percent) and overall robustness, owing to their ability to model long-range dependencies and global semantic structures. We further enhance model transparency using architecture-specific interpretability methods, including Grad-CAM for CNNs and Chefer's attention attribution for ViTs, revealing distinct detection behaviors and validating model trustworthiness. Our results highlight the ViT's superior performance in detecting structural inconsistencies and repetitive textural patterns characteristic of synthetic imagery. Future work will extend this research to multispectral and SAR modalities and integrate frequency-domain analysis to further strengthen detection capabilities and safeguard satellite imagery integrity in high-stakes applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Target-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate world models on path planning toward semantic targets using robot-generated video data, revealing significant limitations and potential improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models generate realistic videos but remain untested in robotic path planning tasks. This study aims to fill that gap by creating a specialized benchmark for evaluation.

Method: Developed Target-Bench, consisting of video data and SLAM-based trajectories, alongside metrics to analyze models' path-planning abilities. Evaluated existing models and improved performance via fine-tuning.

Result: State-of-the-art models achieved low scores (highest at 0.299, Wan2.2-Flash). Fine-tuning significantly improved performance to 0.345 (over 400% improvement compared to base).

Conclusion: Current world models are inadequate for path-planning tasks. Target-Bench highlights gaps and potential improvements, aiding advancements in realistic robotic applications.

Abstract: While recent world models generate highly realistic videos, their ability to perform robot path planning remains unclear and unquantified. We introduce Target-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate world models on mapless path planning toward semantic targets in real-world environments. Target-Bench provides 450 robot-collected video sequences spanning 45 semantic categories with SLAM-based ground truth trajectories. Our evaluation pipeline recovers camera motion from generated videos and measures planning performance using five complementary metrics that quantify target-reaching capability, trajectory accuracy, and directional consistency. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including Sora 2, Veo 3.1, and the Wan series. The best off-the-shelf model (Wan2.2-Flash) achieves only 0.299 overall score, revealing significant limitations in current world models for robotic planning tasks. We show that fine-tuning an open-source 5B-parameter model on only 325 scenarios from our dataset achieves 0.345 overall score -- an improvement of more than 400% over its base version (0.066) and 15% higher than the best off-the-shelf model. We will open-source the code and dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address object hallucination in concatenation-based VLMs, which struggle to distinguish semantically matching image-text pairs.

Method: Proposes interleaved cross-attention layers and spatial knowledge from SAM to enhance visual grounding in small language models.

Result: AGE-VLM significantly reduces hallucination and achieves competitive performance across vision-centric benchmarks.

Conclusion: AGE-VLM offers a promising direction for improving multimodal alignment and visual-linguistic understanding in efficient VLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) rely on effective multimodal alignment between pre-trained vision encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate visual and textual information. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of attention patterns in efficient VLMs, revealing that concatenation-based architectures frequently fail to distinguish between semantically matching and non-matching image-text pairs. This is a key factor for object hallucination in these models. To address this, we introduce Attention-Guided Efficient Vision-Language Models (AGE-VLM), a novel framework that enhances visual grounding through interleaved cross-attention layers to instill vision capabilities in pretrained small language models. This enforces in VLM the ability "look" at the correct image regions by leveraging spatial knowledge distilled from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), significantly reducing hallucination. We validate our approach across different vision-centric benchmarks where our method is better or comparable to prior work on efficient VLMs. Our findings provide valuable insights for future research aimed at achieving enhanced visual and linguistic understanding in VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Pillar-0, a radiology foundation model and RATE framework, achieving significant advancements in radiology tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology faces challenges as imaging volumes grow faster than the workforce; current models do not fully address key clinical requirements.

Method: The authors developed and pretrained Pillar-0 on extensive CT and MRI datasets using RATE to extract structured labels accurately for 366 radiologic findings.

Result: Pillar-0 achieved state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements in AUROC scores over top competitors across diverse radiology tasks.

Conclusion: Pillar-0 and RATE provide a robust, scalable solution for high-performance and clinically relevant radiology applications.

Abstract: Radiology plays an integral role in modern medicine, yet rising imaging volumes have far outpaced workforce growth. Foundation models offer a path toward assisting with the full spectrum of radiology tasks, but existing medical models remain limited: they process volumetric CT and MRI as low-fidelity 2D slices, discard critical grayscale contrast information, and lack evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical practice. We introduce Pillar-0, a radiology foundation model pretrained on 42,990 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 86,411 chest CTs, 14,348 head CTs, and 11,543 breast MRIs from a large academic center, together with RATE, a scalable framework that extracts structured labels for 366 radiologic findings with near-perfect accuracy using LLMs. Across internal test sets of 14,230 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 10,646 chest CTs, 4,906 head CTs, and 1,585 breast MRIs, Pillar-0 establishes a new performance frontier, achieving mean AUROCs of 86.4, 88.0, 90.1, and 82.9, outperforming MedGemma (Google), MedImageInsight (Microsoft), Lingshu (Alibaba), and Merlin (Stanford) by 7.8-15.8 AUROC points and ranking best in 87.2\% (319/366) tasks. Pillar-0 similarly outperforms all baselines in an external validation on the Stanford Abdominal CT dataset, including Merlin (82.2 vs 80.6 AUROC). Pillar-0 extends to tasks beyond its pretraining, such as long-horizon lung cancer risk prediction, where it improves upon the state-of-the-art Sybil by 3.0 C-index points on NLST, and generalizes with gains of 5.9 (MGH) and 1.9 (CGMH). In brain hemorrhage detection, Pillar-0 obtained a >95 AUROC when using only 1/20th of the data of the next most sample efficient baseline. Pillar-0 and RATE together provide an open, clinically rigorous foundation for building high-performance radiology systems, enabling applications that were previously infeasible due to computational, data, and evaluation constraints.

*Chengan Che,Chao Wang,Xinyue Chen,Sophia Tsoka,Luis C. Garcia-Peraza-Herrera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PL-Stitch enhances self-supervised learning (SSL) for analyzing procedural videos like surgeries and cooking by focusing on temporal order to improve video representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL methods fail to account for the temporal order in procedural activities, as shown in experiments where they cannot differentiate forward and time-reversed sequences, pointing out a lack of procedural awareness.

Method: The authors propose PL-Stitch, a framework based on the Plackett-Luce model, which uses two novel objectives: 1) learning chronological order to capture global workflow progression and 2) a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss to focus on fine-grained object correlations across frames.

Result: PL-Stitch outperforms existing methods, achieving notable gains in benchmarks like surgical phase recognition (+11.4% k-NN accuracy) and cooking action segmentation (+5.7% linear probing accuracy).

Conclusion: PL-Stitch effectively leverages temporal order for video analysis, offering significant improvements in recognizing and segmenting procedural videos.

Abstract: Procedural activities, ranging from routine cooking to complex surgical operations, are highly structured as a set of actions conducted in a specific temporal order. Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REXO proposes a novel method for multi-view indoor radar detection that uses explicit feature association through 3D bounding box diffusion, overcoming limitations of implicit methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve indoor radar perception, addressing issues of ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex scenes caused by prior implicit association methods.

Method: REXO introduces a diffusion-based approach that incorporates prior knowledge to guide explicit cross-view radar feature association, reducing ambiguity and improving detection.

Result: Through evaluations on HIBER and MMVR datasets, REXO achieves +4.22 AP and +11.02 AP improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: By leveraging explicit feature association with diffusion in the 3D radar space, REXO significantly enhances radar object detection in indoor environments, establishing a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.

*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Shaoxiu Wei,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve estimation from flow-matching models by introducing an importance-weighted non-IID sampling framework with score-based regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-matching models face difficulties in accurately estimating expectations of their outputs under limited sampling budgets, particularly when dominated by rare but high-impact events.

Method: The method suggests using importance-weighted non-IID sampling to generate diverse samples in salient regions, regularized by a score-based mechanism leveraging the score function to maintain sample quality and avoid off-manifold drift.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in producing high-quality, diverse samples and improving accuracy in importance weights and expectation estimations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances reliability in characterizing flow-matching model outputs, addressing challenges in expectation estimation and sampling quality control.

Abstract: Flow-matching models effectively represent complex distributions, yet estimating expectations of functions of their outputs remains challenging under limited sampling budgets. Independent sampling often yields high-variance estimates, especially when rare but with high-impact outcomes dominate the expectation. We propose an importance-weighted non-IID sampling framework that jointly draws multiple samples to cover diverse, salient regions of a flow's distribution while maintaining unbiased estimation via estimated importance weights. To balance diversity and quality, we introduce a score-based regularization for the diversity mechanism, which uses the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log probability, to ensure samples are pushed apart within high-density regions of the data manifold, mitigating off-manifold drift. We further develop the first approach for importance weighting of non-IID flow samples by learning a residual velocity field that reproduces the marginal distribution of the non-IID samples. Empirically, our method produces diverse, high-quality samples and accurate estimates of both importance weights and expectations, advancing the reliable characterization of flow-matching model outputs. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quality-Aware Loss (QAL) as a replacement for Chamfer Distance (CD) and Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) in 3D vision tasks, improving recall and precision balance for volumetric learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training objectives for volumetric learning in 3D vision tasks struggle to balance recall and precision, limiting their effectiveness in recovering thin structures and under-represented regions.

Method: The authors propose QAL, which decouples recall and precision using tunable components: a coverage-weighted nearest-neighbor term and an uncovered-ground-truth attraction term.

Result: QAL improves coverage scores, with consistent gains over CD (+4.3 points) and other alternatives (+2.8 points). It demonstrates reliable performance across datasets and pipelines, recovering thin structures and aiding robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: QAL provides a robust, interpretable, and practical training objective for 3D vision, generalizing well across datasets and enhancing performance in robotics applications.

Abstract: Volumetric learning underpins many 3D vision tasks such as completion, reconstruction, and mesh generation, yet training objectives still rely on Chamfer Distance (CD) or Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which fail to balance recall and precision. We propose Quality-Aware Loss (QAL), a drop-in replacement for CD/EMD that combines a coverage-weighted nearest-neighbor term with an uncovered-ground-truth attraction term, explicitly decoupling recall and precision into tunable components.
  Across diverse pipelines, QAL achieves consistent coverage gains, improving by an average of +4.3 pts over CD and +2.8 pts over the best alternatives. Though modest in percentage, these improvements reliably recover thin structures and under-represented regions that CD/EMD overlook. Extensive ablations confirm stable performance across hyperparameters and across output resolutions, while full retraining on PCN and ShapeNet demonstrates generalization across datasets and backbones. Moreover, QAL-trained completions yield higher grasp scores under GraspNet evaluation, showing that improved coverage translates directly into more reliable robotic manipulation.
  QAL thus offers a principled, interpretable, and practical objective for robust 3D vision and safety-critical robotics pipelines

Conclusion: Foundation models like BiomedCLIP show potential in breast imaging applications, demonstrating generalizability and interpretability, laying the groundwork for diagnostic task extensions.

Abstract: Foundation models hold promise for specialized medical imaging tasks, though their effectiveness in breast imaging remains underexplored. This study leverages BiomedCLIP as a foundation model to address challenges in model generalization. BiomedCLIP was adapted for automated BI-RADS breast density classification using multi-modality mammographic data (synthesized 2D images, digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis). Using 96,995 images, we compared single-modality (s2D only) and multi-modality training approaches, addressing class imbalance through weighted contrastive learning. Both approaches achieved similar accuracy (multi-modality: 0.74, single-modality: 0.73), with the multi-modality model offering broader applicability across different imaging modalities and higher AUC values consistently above 0.84 across BI-RADS categories. External validation on the RSNA and EMBED datasets showed strong generalization capabilities (AUC range: 0.80-0.93). GradCAM visualizations confirmed consistent and clinically relevant attention patterns, highlighting the models interpretability and robustness. This research underscores the potential of foundation models for breast imaging applications, paving the way for future extensions for diagnostic tasks.

*Yujiang Pu,Zhanbo Huang,Vishnu Boddeti,Yu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShowMe is proposed as a unified framework for both image and video instruction generation by activating spatial and temporal components of video diffusion models. It ensures structural fidelity and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The separation between text-guided image manipulation and video prediction reveals flaws, such as overlooking action unfolding over time or ignoring intended outcomes.

Method: ShowMe selectively activates the spatial and temporal components of video diffusion models and uses structure and motion consistency rewards to improve results.

Result: ShowMe outperformed expert models in instructional image and video generation tasks according to experiments on diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Video diffusion models, with the proposed unification method, serve as effective tools for both action-object transformations in images and videos.

Abstract: Generating visual instructions in a given context is essential for developing interactive world simulators. While prior works address this problem through either text-guided image manipulation or video prediction, these tasks are typically treated in isolation. This separation reveals a fundamental issue: image manipulation methods overlook how actions unfold over time, while video prediction models often ignore the intended outcomes. To this end, we propose ShowMe, a unified framework that enables both tasks by selectively activating the spatial and temporal components of video diffusion models. In addition, we introduce structure and motion consistency rewards to improve structural fidelity and temporal coherence. Notably, this unification brings dual benefits: the spatial knowledge gained through video pretraining enhances contextual consistency and realism in non-rigid image edits, while the instruction-guided manipulation stage equips the model with stronger goal-oriented reasoning for video prediction. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms expert models in both instructional image and video generation, highlighting the strength of video diffusion models as a unified action-object state transformer.

*Chenyi Wang,Zhaowei Li,Ming F. Li,Wujie Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces JigsawComm, a semantic-aware communication-efficient framework for multi-agent cooperative perception, addressing bandwidth limitations while ensuring high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome occlusion and sensing-range limits in autonomous systems by maximizing bandwidth efficiency in cooperative perception, avoiding redundancy and transmitting only necessary data.

Method: Developed JigsawComm, which uses semantic encoding, sparse feature extraction, and feature utility estimation to determine optimal transmission policies among agents.

Result: JigsawComm achieves superior accuracy while reducing data volume by over 500x on benchmarks OPV2V and DAIR-V2X.

Conclusion: JigsawComm ensures scalable, efficient, and accurate cooperative perception by eliminating redundancy and maximizing the utility of transmitted data.

Abstract: Multi-agent cooperative perception (CP) promises to overcome the inherent occlusion and sensing-range limitations of single-agent systems (e.g., autonomous driving). However, its practicality is severely constrained by the limited communication bandwidth. Existing approaches attempt to improve bandwidth efficiency via compression or heuristic message selection, without considering the semantic relevance or cross-agent redundancy of sensory data. We argue that a practical CP system must maximize the contribution of every transmitted bit to the final perception task, by extracting and transmitting semantically essential and non-redundant data. In this paper, we formulate a joint semantic feature encoding and transmission problem, which aims to maximize CP accuracy under limited bandwidth. To solve this problem, we introduce JigsawComm, an end-to-end trained, semantic-aware, and communication-efficient CP framework that learns to ``assemble the puzzle'' of multi-agent feature transmission. It uses a regularized encoder to extract semantically-relevant and sparse features, and a lightweight Feature Utility Estimator to predict the contribution of each agent's features to the final perception task. The resulting meta utility maps are exchanged among agents and leveraged to compute a provably optimal transmission policy, which selects features from agents with the highest utility score for each location. This policy inherently eliminates redundancy and achieves a scalable $\mathcal{O}(1)$ communication cost as the number of agents increases. On the benchmarks OPV2V and DAIR-V2X, JigsawComm reduces the total data volume by up to $>$500$\times$ while achieving matching or superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning of text-to-video diffusion models for camera control requires expansive, hard-to-obtain high-quality datasets. The goal is to reduce this reliance.

Method: The authors propose fine-tuning models using sparse, low-quality synthetic datasets while justifying their approach both intuitively and quantitatively.

Result: The method achieves effective camera parameter controls and yields better results compared to fine-tuning with real, photorealistic data.

Conclusion: Using simple synthetic data for fine-tuning not only meets but surpasses results obtained using conventional high-quality datasets, validating the proposed strategy.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale text-to-video diffusion models to add new generative controls, such as those over physical camera parameters (e.g., shutter speed or aperture), typically requires vast, high-fidelity datasets that are difficult to acquire. In this work, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that learns these controls from sparse, low-quality synthetic data. We show that not only does fine-tuning on such simple data enable the desired controls, it actually yields superior results to models fine-tuned on photorealistic "real" data. Beyond demonstrating these results, we provide a framework that justifies this phenomenon both intuitively and quantitatively.

Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in current Document Visual Question Answering models, such as inadequate spatial relationship modeling, inefficiency with high-resolution inputs, lack of multi-hop reasoning capabilities, and low interpretability.

Method: MGA-VQA uses a multi-modal framework that incorporates token-level encoding, spatial graph reasoning, memory-augmented inference, and question-guided compression, emphasizing interpretable decision pathways and structured memory usage.

Result: Experimental results show that MGA-VQA achieves better accuracy and efficiency in both answer prediction and spatial localization, validated across six benchmarks: FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA, STE-VQA, and RICO.

Conclusion: MGA-VQA provides a significant advancement in Document Visual Question Answering by overcoming current challenges, offering robust accuracy, efficiency, and enhanced interpretability through its novel multi-modal approach.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly understand textual semantics, spatial layout, and visual features. Current methods struggle with explicit spatial relationship modeling, inefficiency with high-resolution documents, multi-hop reasoning, and limited interpretability. We propose MGA-VQA, a multi-modal framework that integrates token-level encoding, spatial graph reasoning, memory-augmented inference, and question-guided compression. Unlike prior black-box models, MGA-VQA introduces interpretable graph-based decision pathways and structured memory access for enhanced reasoning transparency. Evaluation across six benchmarks (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA, STE-VQA, and RICO) demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency, with consistent improvements in both answer prediction and spatial localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArticFlow is a generative model for articulated 3D objects, enabling action-dependent motion generation with high accuracy and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulty of generating articulated 3D objects, which is challenging due to the complexities of action-conditioned deformations and lack of sufficient datasets.

Method: The authors propose ArticFlow, a two-stage flow matching framework combining latent flow (to learn shape priors) and point flow (to condition on action and shape priors) for generating and simulating articulated 3D objects.

Result: ArticFlow outperforms object-specific simulators and static point-cloud generators in kinematic accuracy and shape quality, while also synthesizing new morphologies and generalizing across actions.

Conclusion: Action-conditioned flow matching is a viable approach for producing controllable, high-quality articulated 3D mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have produced strong results for static 3D shapes, whereas articulated 3D generation remains challenging due to action-dependent deformations and limited datasets. We introduce ArticFlow, a two-stage flow matching framework that learns a controllable velocity field from noise to target point sets under explicit action control. ArticFlow couples (i) a latent flow that transports noise to a shape-prior code and (ii) a point flow that transports points conditioned on the action and the shape prior, enabling a single model to represent diverse articulated categories and generalize across actions. On MuJoCo Menagerie, ArticFlow functions both as a generative model and as a neural simulator: it predicts action-conditioned kinematics from a compact prior and synthesizes novel morphologies via latent interpolation. Compared with object-specific simulators and an action-conditioned variant of static point-cloud generators, ArticFlow achieves higher kinematic accuracy and better shape quality. Results show that action-conditioned flow matching is a practical route to controllable and high-quality articulated mechanism generation.

*Guoyang Xia,Yifeng Ding,Fengfa Li,Lei Ren,Wei Chen,Fangxiang Feng,Xiaojie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FastMMoE, a framework designed to optimize Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by reducing visual token redundancy and computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with inference latency caused by high-resolution visual inputs leading to excessive and redundant visual tokens.

Method: FastMMoE employs a training-free framework that combines expert activation reduction and routing-aware token pruning based on similarity in routing probability distributions.

Result: FastMMoE reduces FPLOPs by up to 55% while maintaining 95.5% of the model's original performance, surpassing competitive pruning baselines.

Conclusion: FastMMoE is a promising approach for accelerating MoE-based MLLMs, enabling efficient performance in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance, but high-resolution visual inputs result in long sequences of visual tokens and substantial inference latency. Reducing redundant visual tokens is critical to ease computational/memory burdens while preserving performance, enabling MLLM deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive scenarios. Current visual token pruning methods mainly rely on attention-based redundancy analysis and are tailored to dense architectures. We propose Fast Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (FastMMoE), a training-free acceleration framework for mixture-of-experts (MoE) based MLLMs, developed from a routing analysis perspective. FastMMoE combines two complementary strategies: (i) expert activation reduction for visual tokens to minimize unnecessary expert computation; and (ii) routing-aware token pruning that leverages similarity in routing probability distributions to identify and remove highly redundant visual tokens. Experiments on large-scale MoE-MLLMs such as DeepSeek-VL2 and InternVL3.5 demonstrate that FastMMoE can reduce FLOPs by up to 55.0% while retaining approximately 95.5% of the original performance, consistently outperforming dense-model pruning baselines including FastV and SparseVLM across multiple retention rates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores knowledge distillation for vision-language models, finding that stronger teachers do not always produce better students, challenging usual assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are computationally demanding, and knowledge distillation offers a pathway to creating efficient models without significant performance loss.

Method: The study systematically examines distillation techniques applied to CLIP-style VLMs, analyzing various teacher models and their impact, alongside downstream tasks.

Result: Stronger teacher models do not consistently enhance student model performance, and current distillation frameworks often fail to scale effectively for multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: Existing distillation methods need rethinking for better scalability and efficiency in multimodal tasks, pointing to innovative directions for developing resource-efficient models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across multimodal tasks, yet their substantial computational demands hinder efficient deployment. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful approach for building lightweight but competitive models, with strong evidence from both language and vision domains. However, its application to VLMs, particularly CLIP-style models, remains limited, often constrained to small-scale teachers and narrow evaluation tasks such as classification or retrieval. In this work, we present the first systematic study of distillation across a range of CLIP-style teacher models, ranging from standard baselines to large-scale state-of-the-art models. Contrary to trends observed in NLP and vision, we find that stronger teachers do not consistently yield better students; in fact, existing distillation frameworks often fail to scale, leading to degraded performance in downstream multimodal tasks such as visual question answering. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in KD and point toward new directions for designing parameter-efficient multimodal models.

*Seulgi Jeong,Jaeil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MINDiff, a method that reduces overfitting in text-to-image models at inference, eliminating computationally intensive retraining approaches like DreamBooth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to personalization in text-to-image models like DreamBooth involve costly training processes and limited user control during inference. The paper seeks to overcome these inefficiencies.

Method: The proposed MINDiff method integrates a negative attention mechanism during inference, suppressing the subject's impact in irrelevant regions. It enables user-controlled balancing of subject fidelity and text alignment through a scaling parameter, without requiring model retraining.

Result: MINDiff outperforms DreamBooth’s class-specific prior-preservation loss in mitigating overfitting, as evidenced by qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: MINDiff offers a computationally efficient and flexible approach to improving text-to-image personalization by operating exclusively at inference without altering model architectures.

Abstract: In the personalization process of large-scale text-to-image models, overfitting often occurs when learning specific subject from a limited number of images. Existing methods, such as DreamBooth, mitigate this issue through a class-specific prior-preservation loss, which requires increased computational cost during training and limits user control during inference time. To address these limitations, we propose Mask-Integrated Negative Attention Diffusion (MINDiff). MINDiff introduces a novel concept, negative attention, which suppresses the subject's influence in masked irrelevant regions. We achieve this by modifying the cross-attention mechanism during inference. This enables semantic control and improves text alignment by reducing subject dominance in irrelevant regions. Additionally, during the inference time, users can adjust a scale parameter lambda to balance subject fidelity and text alignment. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments on DreamBooth models demonstrate that MINDiff mitigates overfitting more effectively than class-specific prior-preservation loss. As our method operates entirely at inference time and does not alter the model architecture, it can be directly applied to existing DreamBooth models without re-training. Our code is available at https://github.com/seuleepy/MINDiff.

*Wenyuan Li,Guang Li,Keisuke Maeda,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DAVDD, a method to improve audio-visual dataset distillation by leveraging a pretrained model and decoupled representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with aligning cross-modal data and preserving modality-specific details, leading to a decline in distilled dataset quality.

Method: The method uses pretrained modality banks and decoupler banks to separate common and private features, while aligning shared information at sample and distribution levels without cross-contaminating private representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show that DAVDD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all dataset settings.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses cross-modal alignment and modality-specific preservation, making it suitable for high-quality audio-visual dataset distillation.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation aims to compress large-scale datasets into compact subsets while preserving the performance of the original data. However, conventional Distribution Matching (DM) methods struggle to capture intrinsic cross-modal alignment. Subsequent studies have attempted to introduce cross-modal matching, but two major challenges remain: (i) independently and randomly initialized encoders lead to inconsistent modality mapping spaces, increasing training difficulty; and (ii) direct interactions between modalities tend to damage modality-specific (private) information, thereby degrading the quality of the distilled data. To address these challenges, we propose DAVDD, a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework. DAVDD leverages a diverse pretrained bank to obtain stable modality features and uses a lightweight decoupler bank to disentangle them into common and private representations. To effectively preserve cross-modal structure, we further introduce Common Intermodal Matching together with a Sample-Distribution Joint Alignment strategy, ensuring that shared representations are aligned both at the sample level and the global distribution level. Meanwhile, private representations are entirely isolated from cross-modal interaction, safeguarding modality-specific cues throughout distillation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DAVDD achieves state-of-the-art results under all IPC settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of decoupled representation learning for high-quality audio-visual dataset distillation. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CUS-GS introduces a unified structured approach for Gaussian Splatting to bridge the semantic and geometry modeling gap in 3D scene representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between semantic understanding and explicit geometry modeling in current Gaussian Splatting 3D scene representations.

Method: The paper proposes CUS-GS that combines voxelized anchors and multimodal semantic features from foundation models, ensures unified representation across feature spaces, and employs dynamic anchor management for efficient modeling.

Result: CUS-GS achieves strong competitive performance using only 6M parameters, significantly fewer than the closest rival with 35M, while maintaining high efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances performance with model efficiency, advancing 3D scene representation integration for semantics and geometric modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting based 3D scene representation have shown two major trends: semantics-oriented approaches that focus on high-level understanding but lack explicit 3D geometry modeling, and structure-oriented approaches that capture spatial structures yet provide limited semantic abstraction. To bridge this gap, we present CUS-GS, a compact unified structured Gaussian Splatting representation, which connects multimodal semantic features with structured 3D geometry. Specifically, we design a voxelized anchor structure that constructs a spatial scaffold, while extracting multimodal semantic features from a set of foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, SEEM). Moreover, we introduce a multimodal latent feature allocation mechanism to unify appearance, geometry, and semantics across heterogeneous feature spaces, ensuring a consistent representation across multiple foundation models. Finally, we propose a feature-aware significance evaluation strategy to dynamically guide anchor growing and pruning, effectively removing redundant or invalid anchors while maintaining semantic integrity. Extensive experiments show that CUS-GS achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods using as few as 6M parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than the closest rival at 35M - highlighting the excellent trade off between performance and model efficiency of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: The paper addresses dataset distillation for long-tailed distributions, introducing a module called ADSA to improve performance under label imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dataset distillation methods struggle with real-world imbalanced datasets, leading to performance degradation.

Method: The authors propose ADSA (Adaptive Soft-label Alignment module) to calibrate soft-label bias caused by data and model imbalance during distillation.

Result: ADSA boosts tail-class accuracy by up to 11.8% on ImageNet-1k-LT and improves overall accuracy to 41.4%.

Conclusion: ADSA proves to be an effective enhancement for long-tailed dataset distillation, achieving significant performance improvements and exhibiting robust generalization.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large-scale datasets into compact, highly informative synthetic data, significantly reducing storage and training costs. However, existing research primarily focuses on balanced datasets and struggles to perform under real-world long-tailed distributions. In this work, we emphasize the critical role of soft labels in long-tailed dataset distillation and uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to performance degradation. Specifically, we derive an imbalance-aware generalization bound for model trained on distilled dataset. We then identify two primary sources of soft-label bias, which originate from the distillation model and the distilled images, through systematic perturbation of the data imbalance levels. To address this, we propose ADSA, an Adaptive Soft-label Alignment module that calibrates the entangled biases. This lightweight module integrates seamlessly into existing distillation pipelines and consistently improves performance. On ImageNet-1k-LT with EDC and IPC=50, ADSA improves tail-class accuracy by up to 11.8% and raises overall accuracy to 41.4%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSA provides a robust and generalizable solution under limited label budgets and across a range of distillation techniques.

*Youngsik Yun,Dongjun Gu,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a solution to improve the generalization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for novel view synthesis by introducing a novel regularization method called Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles to generalize to novel viewpoints in few-shot scenarios due to overfitting, and existing strategies like SAM are not optimal for solving this problem due to differences in task requirements.

Method: The authors propose Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR), which adjusts regularization strengths and neighborhood radii based on the local frequency of images, addressing challenges of excessive or insufficient regularization.

Result: The method effectively prevents floater artifacts, preserves fine details, and consistently improves performance across datasets and varying configurations compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: FASR enhances the generalization ability of 3DGS for novel viewpoint synthesis by optimizing regularization strategies, addressing limitations of existing methods like SAM, and ensuring preservation of detail and artifact prevention.

Abstract: Despite 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excelling in most configurations, it lacks generalization across novel viewpoints in a few-shot scenario because it overfits to the sparse observations. We revisit 3DGS optimization from a machine learning perspective, framing novel view synthesis as a generalization problem to unseen viewpoints-an underexplored direction. We propose Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR), which reformulates the 3DGS training objective, thereby guiding 3DGS to converge toward a better generalization solution. Although Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) similarly reduces the sharpness of the loss landscape to improve generalization of classification models, directly employing it to 3DGS is suboptimal due to the discrepancy between the tasks. Specifically, it hinders reconstructing high-frequency details due to excessive regularization, while reducing its strength leads to under-penalizing sharpness. To address this, we reflect the local frequency of images to set the regularization weight and the neighborhood radius when estimating the local sharpness. It prevents floater artifacts in novel viewpoints and reconstructs fine details that SAM tends to oversmooth. Across datasets with various configurations, our method consistently improves a wide range of baselines. Code will be available at https://bbangsik13.github.io/FASR.

*Yingjie Ma,Xun Lin,Yong Xu,Weicheng Xie,Zitong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PA-FAS to improve multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability in face anti-spoofing (FAS) by addressing limitations in reasoning paths and shortcut learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face anti-spoofing requires efficient multimodal reasoning, but existing methods face challenges such as limited annotations, shallow reasoning, and difficulties in combining modalities effectively.

Method: The authors introduce PA-FAS, combining enhanced reasoning paths from limited annotations and an answer-shuffling mechanism to promote deeper multimodal analysis and reduce shortcut learning.

Result: PA-FAS improves multimodal reasoning accuracy, cross-domain generalization, and unification of fusion, generalization, and interpretability in FAS.

Conclusion: This method effectively addresses key issues in multimodal FAS, setting a new direction for designing effective and interpretable FAS models.

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has recently advanced in multimodal fusion, cross-domain generalization, and interpretability. With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning. PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MambaTAD, a state-space model for Temporal Action Detection (TAD), addressing challenges in long-span action instance detection with innovative modules to enhance global feature fusion and detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in detecting long-span action instances in video data, such as decay of temporal context and self-element conflict, which limit the performance of existing structured state-space models and other TAD methods.

Method: The authors propose MambaTAD, incorporating a Diagonal-Masked Bidirectional State-Space (DMBSS) module for global feature fusion and a global feature fusion head for multi-granularity feature refinement, along with a state-space temporal adapter (SSTA) for end-to-end one-stage processing.

Result: MambaTAD consistently achieves superior TAD performance on multiple public benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in handling long-span action detection.

Conclusion: MambaTAD addresses critical limitations in current TAD approaches by leveraging novel state-space solutions, offering an efficient and accurate framework for temporal action detection in untrimmed videos.

Abstract: Temporal Action Detection (TAD) aims to identify and localize actions by determining their starting and ending frames within untrimmed videos. Recent Structured State-Space Models such as Mamba have demonstrated potential in TAD due to their long-range modeling capability and linear computational complexity. On the other hand, structured state-space models often face two key challenges in TAD, namely, decay of temporal context due to recursive processing and self-element conflict during global visual context modeling, which become more severe while handling long-span action instances. Additionally, traditional methods for TAD struggle with detecting long-span action instances due to a lack of global awareness and inefficient detection heads. This paper presents MambaTAD, a new state-space TAD model that introduces long-range modeling and global feature detection capabilities for accurate temporal action detection. MambaTAD comprises two novel designs that complement each other with superior TAD performance. First, it introduces a Diagonal-Masked Bidirectional State-Space (DMBSS) module which effectively facilitates global feature fusion and temporal action detection. Second, it introduces a global feature fusion head that refines the detection progressively with multi-granularity features and global awareness. In addition, MambaTAD tackles TAD in an end-to-end one-stage manner using a new state-space temporal adapter(SSTA) which reduces network parameters and computation cost with linear complexity. Extensive experiments show that MambaTAD achieves superior TAD performance consistently across multiple public benchmarks.

*Yuan Qu,Zhipeng Zhang,Chaojun Xu,Qiao Wan,Mengying Xie,Yuzeng Chen,Zhenqi Liu,Yanfei Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniRSCD, a unified framework for remote sensing change detection, designed to address challenges in current methods requiring specialized decoders for various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the reliance on task-specific decoders and to create a universal architecture for change detection scenarios, accommodating abrupt changes and different output granularities.

Method: A unified framework named UniRSCD is proposed, involving a unified encoder that integrates high- and low-frequency information and a shared decoder for hierarchical feature interaction and task-adaptive mapping.

Result: UniRSCD performs effectively across multiple tasks and achieves top performance on five datasets including LEVIR-CD, SECOND, and xBD.

Conclusion: The method provides a versatile and robust solution for remote sensing change detection, catering to varying task requirements with strong experimental validation.

Abstract: In recent years, remote sensing change detection has garnered significant attention due to its critical role in resource monitoring and disaster assessment. Change detection tasks exist with different output granularities such as BCD, SCD, and BDA. However, existing methods require substantial expert knowledge to design specialized decoders that compensate for information loss during encoding across different tasks. This not only introduces uncertainty into the process of selecting optimal models for abrupt change scenarios (such as disaster outbreaks) but also limits the universality of these architectures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, general change detection framework named UniRSCD. Building upon a state space model backbone, we introduce a frequency change prompt generator as a unified encoder. The encoder dynamically scans bitemporal global context information while integrating high-frequency details with low-frequency holistic information, thereby eliminating the need for specialized decoders for feature compensation. Subsequently, the unified decoder and prediction head establish a shared representation space through hierarchical feature interaction and task-adaptive output mapping. This integrating various tasks such as binary change detection and semantic change detection into a unified architecture, thereby accommodating the differing output granularity requirements of distinct change detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture can adapt to multiple change detection tasks and achieves leading performance on five datasets, including the binary change dataset LEVIR-CD, the semantic change dataset SECOND, and the building damage assessment dataset xBD.

*Yan Xu,Yixing Wang,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to sparse-input novel view synthesis by leveraging pretrained video diffusion models to generate plausible intermediary views and improve 3D scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of synthesizing coherent and natural novel views from highly sparse inputs, aiming to simulate realistic video sequences as the camera moves through a scene.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a zero-shot framework guided by pretrained video diffusion models, combined with an uncertainty-aware mechanism for spatial consistency. It iteratively feeds back between 3D geometry reconstruction and 2D view synthesis to achieve better coherence and fidelity.

Result: The results show that the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques under extreme input sparsity across multiple benchmark datasets, including LLFF, DTU, DL3DV, and MipNeRF-360.

Conclusion: This approach enables high-fidelity scene renderings with sparse observations, requiring no scene-specific training or fine-tuning and demonstrating its robustness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Given just a few glimpses of a scene, can you imagine the movie playing out as the camera glides through it? That's the lens we take on \emph{sparse-input novel view synthesis}, not only as filling spatial gaps between widely spaced views, but also as \emph{completing a natural video} unfolding through space.
  We recast the task as \emph{test-time natural video completion}, using powerful priors from \emph{pretrained video diffusion models} to hallucinate plausible in-between views. Our \emph{zero-shot, generation-guided} framework produces pseudo views at novel camera poses, modulated by an \emph{uncertainty-aware mechanism} for spatial coherence. These synthesized frames densify supervision for \emph{3D Gaussian Splatting} (3D-GS) for scene reconstruction, especially in under-observed regions. An iterative feedback loop lets 3D geometry and 2D view synthesis inform each other, improving both the scene reconstruction and the generated views.
  The result is coherent, high-fidelity renderings from sparse inputs \emph{without any scene-specific training or fine-tuning}. On LLFF, DTU, DL3DV, and MipNeRF-360, our method significantly outperforms strong 3D-GS baselines under extreme sparsity.

TL;DR: This paper introduces V2X-RECT, a trajectory prediction framework for high-density traffic, addressing challenges of identity mismatches and redundant trajectory encoding for better efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve traffic safety and efficiency by overcoming perception limitations in dense traffic caused by identity switching and redundant encoding in trajectory predictions.

Method: The paper proposes modules for multi-source identity consistency, traffic signal-guided interactions to filter key vehicles, and local spatiotemporal encoding to optimize feature usage.

Result: V2X-RECT demonstrated significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in robustness, accuracy, and inference efficiency across diverse traffic densities using V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj datasets.

Conclusion: V2X-RECT effectively addresses challenges in trajectory prediction under high-density traffic, achieving high performance and robustness, making it a promising tool for traffic management.

Abstract: V2X prediction can alleviate perception incompleteness caused by limited line of sight through fusing trajectory data from infrastructure and vehicles, which is crucial to traffic safety and efficiency. However, in dense traffic scenarios, frequent identity switching of targets hinders cross-view association and fusion. Meanwhile, multi-source information tends to generate redundant interactions during the encoding stage, and traditional vehicle-centric encoding leads to large amounts of repetitive historical trajectory feature encoding, degrading real-time inference performance. To address these challenges, we propose V2X-RECT, a trajectory prediction framework designed for high-density environments. It enhances data association consistency, reduces redundant interactions, and reuses historical information to enable more efficient and accurate prediction. Specifically, we design a multi-source identity matching and correction module that leverages multi-view spatiotemporal relationships to achieve stable and consistent target association, mitigating the adverse effects of mismatches on trajectory encoding and cross-view feature fusion. Then we introduce traffic signal-guided interaction module, encoding trend of traffic light changes as features and exploiting their role in constraining spatiotemporal passage rights to accurately filter key interacting vehicles, while capturing the dynamic impact of signal changes on interaction patterns. Furthermore, a local spatiotemporal coordinate encoding enables reusable features of historical trajectories and map, supporting parallel decoding and significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experimental results across V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj datasets demonstrate that our V2X-RECT achieves significant improvements compared to SOTA methods, while also enhancing robustness and inference efficiency across diverse traffic densities.

TL;DR: SciEducator introduces a self-evolving multi-agent system for scientific video understanding and education, outperforming existing solutions and providing multimodal educational content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current MLLMs and video agents in the domain of scientific video understanding and education, which require professional knowledge integration and step-wise reasoning.

Method: The system employs the Deming Cycle philosophy reformulated into a self-evolving reasoning and feedback mechanism and supports scientific action comprehension through multimodal content generation.

Result: SciEducator substantially outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs and video agents on SciVBench, a benchmark constructed with 500 expert-verified science QA pairs.

Conclusion: The proposed system, SciEducator, establishes a robust and innovative paradigm for scientific video comprehension and education, enabling tailored multimodal educational outputs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and video agent systems have significantly improved general video understanding. However, when applied to scientific video understanding and educating, a domain that demands external professional knowledge integration and rigorous step-wise reasoning, existing approaches often struggle. To bridge this gap, we propose SciEducator, the first iterative self-evolving multi-agent system for scientific video comprehension and education. Rooted in the classical Deming Cycle from management science, our design reformulates its Plan-Do-Study-Act philosophy into a self-evolving reasoning and feedback mechanism, which facilitates the interpretation of intricate scientific activities in videos. Moreover, SciEducator can produce multimodal educational content tailored to specific scientific processes, including textual instructions, visual guides, audio narrations, and interactive references. To support evaluation, we construct SciVBench, a benchmark consisting of 500 expert-verified and literature-grounded science QA pairs across five categories, covering physical, chemical, and everyday phenomena. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SciEducator substantially outperforms leading closed-source MLLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o) and state-of-the-art video agents on the benchmark, establishing a new paradigm for the community.

### [197] [Test-Time Temporal Sampling for Efficient MLLM Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17945)
*Kaibin Wang,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Test-Time Temporal Sampling (T3S), a training-free method to efficiently and accurately process long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), reducing computational costs and improving inference speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos require significant computational resources for processing due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention mechanisms in MLLMs. Existing solutions often compromise accuracy, require training, or slow inference, which presents a significant challenge.

Method: The paper proposes T3S, a plug-and-play inference wrapper that generates multiple short and diverse subsequences from long videos at inference time. It packs them into a single pass, aggregates predictions, and exploits redundancy in video tokens to reduce computational costs.

Result: Experiments show that T3S achieves a 3.1% accuracy improvement and reduces inference latency by a factor of 2.04, while requiring minimal integration effort, with compatibility across different pretrained MLLMs.

Conclusion: T3S offers an efficient and effective inference-time solution for long video understanding, leveraging video redundancy for computational savings and scalability while maintaining broad model compatibility.

Abstract: Processing long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) poses a significant computational challenge, as the model's self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of video tokens, resulting in high computational demand and slow inference speed. Current solutions, such as rule-based sub-sampling, learned frame selector, or memory-based summarization, often introduce their own trade-offs: they compromise accuracy, necessitate additional training, or decrease inference speed. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Temporal Sampling (T3S), a training-free, plug-and-play inference wrapper that enables MLLMs to process long videos both efficiently and effectively. T3S exploits spatiotemporal redundancy by generating multiple short and diverse subsequences of video tokens at inference time, packing them within a single forward pass, and aggregating their predictions. This multi-subsequence formulation broadens visual coverage while reducing the computational cost of self-attention from $O(L^2)$ to $O(\sum_{i=1}^m α_i^2L^2)$, where $\sum_{i=1}^m α_i^2 < 1$. Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that T3S improves accuracy by up to 3.1% and reduces first token delay by $2.04\times$, all with minimal integration effort. Our approach operates entirely at inference time, requires no model modifications or fine-tuning, and is compatible with a wide range of pretrained MLLMs. T3S turns video redundancy into a computational advantage, offering a scalable solution for long-video understanding.

### [198] [Multi-speaker Attention Alignment for Multimodal Social Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17952)
*Liangyang Ouyang,Yifei Huang,Mingfang Zhang,Caixin Kang,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights the dynamic interplay of verbal and non-verbal cues in social interaction modeling in videos using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It identifies failure due to inconsistent cross-modal speaker-token alignment and introduces methods to enhance this through adaptive social-aware attention bias, significantly improving multi-party social reasoning results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs show inconsistent performance in multi-speaker video analysis, particularly due to weak cross-modal attention patterns between visual and textual inputs, limiting their ability for in-depth social reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors propose a multimodal multi-speaker attention alignment method involving dynamic cross-modal head selection and an adaptive social-aware attention bias injected into the attention mechanism to improve alignment between a speaker's visual representation and their utterances.

Result: The proposed method enhances MLLMs and achieves state-of-the-art results across four social tasks on three benchmarks. Visualizations confirm improved focus on speaker-relevant regions during multi-party social reasoning.

Conclusion: The novel approach resolves cross-modal attention alignment issues in multi-speaker scenes and boosts the performance of existing MLLMs, enabling robust reasoning in social interaction modeling tasks.

Abstract: Understanding social interaction in video requires reasoning over a dynamic interplay of verbal and non-verbal cues: who is speaking, to whom, and with what gaze or gestures. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are natural candidates, simply adding visual inputs yields surprisingly inconsistent gains on social tasks. Our quantitative analysis of cross-modal attention inside state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a core failure mode: in multi-speaker scenes, visual and textual tokens lack speaker-consistent alignment, exhibiting substantially weaker cross-modal attention than in object-centric images. To address this, we propose a multimodal multi-speaker attention alignment method that can be integrated into existing MLLMs. First, we introduce dynamic cross-modal head selection to identify attention heads most responsible for grounding. Then, an adaptive social-aware attention bias, computed from existing attention patterns and speaker locations, is injected into the attention mechanism. This bias reinforces alignment between a speaker's visual representation and their utterances without introducing trainable parameters or architectural changes. We integrate our method into three distinct MLLMs (LLaVA-NeXT-Video, Qwen2.5-VL, and InternVL3) and evaluate on three benchmarks (TVQA+, MMSI, OnlineMMSI). Across four social tasks, results demonstrate that our approach improves the ability of MLLMs and achieves state-of-the-art results. Attention visualizations confirm our method successfully focuses the model on speaker-relevant regions, enabling more robust multi-party social reasoning. Our implementation and model will be available at https://github.com/ut-vision/SocialInteraction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HEAL, an advanced framework for Source Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) to address clinical data privacy and storage issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in SFUDA caused by absence of source data and target domain label supervision in clinical applications.

Method: Proposes HEAL framework featuring Hierarchical denoising, Edge-guided selection, size-Aware fusion, and Learning-free characteristic.

Result: HEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance in large-scale cross-modality experiments, outperforming existing SFUDA methods.

Conclusion: The HEAL framework addresses SFUDA challenges effectively, offering a robust solution to domain adaptation without source data or target labels.

Abstract: Growing demands for clinical data privacy and storage constraints have spurred advances in Source Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA). SFUDA addresses the domain shift by adapting models from the source domain to the unseen target domain without accessing source data, even when target-domain labels are unavailable. However, SFUDA faces significant challenges: the absence of source domain data and label supervision in the target domain due to source free and unsupervised settings. To address these issues, we propose HEAL, a novel SFUDA framework that integrates Hierarchical denoising, Edge-guided selection, size-Aware fusion, and Learning-free characteristic. Large-scale cross-modality experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SFUDA approaches, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust pipeline to develop versatile and transferable large multimodal models (LMMs) for visual quality assessment (VQualA), addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQualA LMMs face challenges due to overfitting, limited tasks focus, and lack of generalization, requiring an innovative approach to enhance versatility and transferability.

Method: A vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline is employed, creating the VITAL-Series models using multi-task training and an expansive 4.5M vision-language dataset, accompanied by efficient paired decoders requiring minimal calibration.

Result: The VITAL-Series models demonstrated strong zero-shot performance, high quantitative scoring accuracy, quality interpretation capabilities for image and video modalities, and efficient transferability.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline and VITAL-Series models provide a foundation for further development of versatile LMMs in visual quality assessment, overcoming task and modality limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Developing a robust visual quality assessment (VQualA) large multi-modal model (LMM) requires achieving versatility, powerfulness, and transferability.
  However, existing VQualA LMMs typically focus on a single task and rely on full-parameter fine-tuning, which makes them prone to overfitting on specific modalities or task types, thereby limiting their generalization capacity and transferability. To address this, we propose a vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline and develop the VITAL-Series LMMs. (1) We adopt a machine-executed annotation-scrutiny paradigm, constructing over 4.5M vision-language (VL) pairs-the largest VQualA training dataset to date. (2) We employ a multi-task training workflow that simultaneously enhances the model's quantitative scoring precision and strengthens its capability for quality interpretation across both image and video modalities. (3) Building upon the vision encoder, we realize an efficient model zoo extension: the model zoo exhibits strong zero-shot performance, and each paired decoder requires only a swift warm-up using less than 1/1000 of the pre-training data to achieve performance comparable to the fully trained counterpart. Overall, our work lays a cornerstone for advancing toward the foundation LMM for VQualA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current limitations of large-scale vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) due to challenges like modality gaps and the need for spatiotemporal utilization.

Method: The X-ReID framework employs Cross-modality Prototype Collaboration (CPC) for aligning features and reducing modality gaps, and Multi-granularity Information Interaction (MII) to enhance temporal modeling and alignment. These methods culminate in robust sequence-level representations.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques on two large-scale VVI-ReID benchmarks: HITSZ-VCM and BUPTCampus.

Conclusion: The X-ReID framework effectively addresses modality gaps and improves VVI-ReID performance by building robust spatiotemporal representations, as validated by extensive experimental results.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have recently achieved remarkable performance in retrieval tasks, yet their potential for Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) remains largely unexplored. The primary challenges are narrowing the modality gap and leveraging spatiotemporal information in video sequences. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality feature learning framework named X-ReID for VVI-ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Cross-modality Prototype Collaboration (CPC) to align and integrate features from different modalities, guiding the network to reduce the modality discrepancy. Then, a Multi-granularity Information Interaction (MII) is designed, incorporating short-term interactions from adjacent frames, long-term cross-frame information fusion, and cross-modality feature alignment to enhance temporal modeling and further reduce modality gaps. Finally, by integrating multi-granularity information, a robust sequence-level representation is achieved. Extensive experiments on two large-scale VVI-ReID benchmarks (i.e., HITSZ-VCM and BUPTCampus) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Signal framework for multi-modal object ReID, including selective patch token interaction and feature alignment modules for improved discriminative feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the background interference in multi-modal object ReID and improve multi-modal feature consistency alignment, which are limitations of existing methods.

Method: The proposed method includes two major modules: a Selective Interaction Module (SIM) for extracting important patch tokens with intra-modal and inter-modal information, and alignment modules (GAM and LAM) for global and local feature consistency.

Result: The paper demonstrates the proposed framework's effectiveness on three benchmarks: RGBNT201, RGBNT100, and MSVR310, with experimentally validated results.

Conclusion: Signal framework improves feature discrimination and alignment in multi-modal object ReID tasks, with publicly available source code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) is devoted to retrieving specific objects through the exploitation of complementary multi-modal image information. Existing methods mainly concentrate on the fusion of multi-modal features, yet neglecting the background interference. Besides, current multi-modal fusion methods often focus on aligning modality pairs but suffer from multi-modal consistency alignment. To address these issues, we propose a novel selective interaction and global-local alignment framework called Signal for multi-modal object ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Selective Interaction Module (SIM) to select important patch tokens with intra-modal and inter-modal information. These important patch tokens engage in the interaction with class tokens, thereby yielding more discriminative features. Then, we propose a Global Alignment Module (GAM) to simultaneously align multi-modal features by minimizing the volume of 3D polyhedra in the gramian space. Meanwhile, we propose a Local Alignment Module (LAM) to align local features in a shift-aware manner. With these modules, our proposed framework could extract more discriminative features for object ReID. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) validate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGBT trackers face challenges in addressing modality discrepancies, which limits effective feature representation and reduces tracking accuracy.

Method: The proposed CADTrack framework includes: 1) Mamba-based Feature Interaction (MFI) for efficient feature interaction, 2) Contextual Aggregation Module (CAM) for dynamic cross-layer feature aggregation, and 3) Deformable Alignment Module (DAM) for mitigating spatial misalignment and localization drift.

Result: CADTrack demonstrated robust and accurate tracking performance across five RGBT tracking benchmarks, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: CADTrack significantly improves RGBT tracking performance by addressing modality discrepancies through novel feature interaction, contextual aggregation, and deformable alignment strategies.

Abstract: RGB-Thermal (RGBT) tracking aims to exploit visible and thermal infrared modalities for robust all-weather object tracking. However, existing RGBT trackers struggle to resolve modality discrepancies, which poses great challenges for robust feature representation. This limitation hinders effective cross-modal information propagation and fusion, which significantly reduces the tracking accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Contextual Aggregation with Deformable Alignment framework called CADTrack for RGBT Tracking. To be specific, we first deploy the Mamba-based Feature Interaction (MFI) that establishes efficient feature interaction via state space models. This interaction module can operate with linear complexity, reducing computational cost and improving feature discrimination. Then, we propose the Contextual Aggregation Module (CAM) that dynamically activates backbone layers through sparse gating based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). This module can encode complementary contextual information from cross-layer features. Finally, we propose the Deformable Alignment Module (DAM) to integrate deformable sampling and temporal propagation, mitigating spatial misalignment and localization drift. With the above components, our CADTrack achieves robust and accurate tracking in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on five RGBT tracking benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is released at https://github.com/IdolLab/CADTrack.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) by proposing adversarial pseudo-replay (APR), a technique to avoid catastrophic forgetting and balance adaptability while learning new tasks without storing past images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to tackle the plasticity-stability dilemma in EFCIL, where the system needs to learn new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous tasks without storing images from earlier tasks, driven by storage limitations and privacy concerns.

Method: The proposed method, APR, uses adversarial attacks on new task images combined with augmented old class prototypes to generate pseudo-replay samples for online learning. Additionally, a transfer matrix is learned to calibrate covariance matrices to prevent semantic drift.

Result: APR successfully prevents semantic drift and addresses the stability-plasticity challenge. Experiments demonstrate that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard EFCIL benchmarks, especially in challenging cold-start scenarios.

Conclusion: The APR method solves the critical issue of balancing stability and plasticity in EFCIL, making it effective for learning incrementally without storing previous images.

Abstract: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) aims to retain old knowledge acquired in the previous task while learning new classes, without storing the previous images due to storage constraints or privacy concerns. In EFCIL, the plasticity-stability dilemma, learning new tasks versus catastrophic forgetting, is a significant challenge, primarily due to the unavailability of images from earlier tasks. In this paper, we introduce adversarial pseudo-replay (APR), a method that perturbs the images of the new task with adversarial attack, to synthesize the pseudo-replay images online without storing any replay samples. During the new task training, the adversarial attack is conducted on the new task images with augmented old class mean prototypes as targets, and the resulting images are used for knowledge distillation to prevent semantic drift. Moreover, we calibrate the covariance matrices to compensate for the semantic drift after each task, by learning a transfer matrix on the pseudo-replay samples. Our method reconciles stability and plasticity, achieving state-of-the-art on challenging cold-start settings of the standard EFCIL benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively adapting pretrained diffusion models to new tasks.

Method: Developed FeRA, a framework featuring (i) a frequency energy indicator, (ii) a soft frequency router for adaptive parameter updates, and (iii) a consistency regularization mechanism.

Result: FeRA enables stable, coherent, and effective adaptation of diffusion models, demonstrating compatibility with adapter-based tuning methods across various backbones and resolutions.

Conclusion: The frequency-driven adaptation approach of FeRA ensures robust and efficient tuning of diffusion models, enhancing their applicability to new tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, yet how to effectively adapt large pretrained models to new tasks remains challenging. We revisit the reconstruction behavior of diffusion models during denoising to unveil the underlying frequency energy mechanism governing this process. Building upon this observation, we propose FeRA, a frequency driven fine tuning framework that aligns parameter updates with the intrinsic frequency energy progression of diffusion. FeRA establishes a comprehensive frequency energy framework for effective diffusion adaptation fine tuning, comprising three synergistic components: (i) a compact frequency energy indicator that characterizes the latent bandwise energy distribution, (ii) a soft frequency router that adaptively fuses multiple frequency specific adapter experts, and (iii) a frequency energy consistency regularization that stabilizes diffusion optimization and ensures coherent adaptation across bands. Routing operates in both training and inference, with inference time routing dynamically determined by the latent frequency energy. It integrates seamlessly with adapter based tuning schemes and generalizes well across diffusion backbones and resolutions. By aligning adaptation with the frequency energy mechanism, FeRA provides a simple, stable, and compatible paradigm for effective and robust diffusion model adaptation.

Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar. Real-world reconstruction at kilometer scale validates the potential of Rad-GS for large-scale scene reconstruction.

### [207] [Plan-X: Instruct Video Generation via Semantic Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17986)
*Lun Huang,You Xie,Hongyi Xu,Tianpei Gu,Chenxu Zhang,Guoxian Song,Zenan Li,Xiaochen Zhao,Linjie Luo,Guillermo Sapiro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Plan-X introduces a framework combining semantic planning with video diffusion models to mitigate issues like visual hallucinations and misalignments, enabling better instruction-aligned video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in diffusion transformers' ability to handle high-level semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning, especially for complex scenes, interactions, and temporal reasoning.

Method: Plan-X employs a learnable Semantic Planner, a multimodal language model, to generate semantic tokens based on user intent, which guide a video diffusion model for detailed video synthesis.

Result: Plan-X reduces visual hallucinations and ensures fine-grained, instruction-aligned video generation consistent with input text and visual context.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates advanced semantic planning and diffusion model capabilities for improved video generation quality in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual synthesis, yet they often struggle with high-level semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. This limitation frequently leads to visual hallucinations and mis-alignments with user instructions, especially in scenarios involving complex scene understanding, human-object interactions, multi-stage actions, and in-context motion reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Plan-X, a framework that explicitly enforces high-level semantic planning to instruct video generation process. At its core lies a Semantic Planner, a learnable multimodal language model that reasons over the user's intent from both text prompts and visual context, and autoregressively generates a sequence of text-grounded spatio-temporal semantic tokens. These semantic tokens, complementary to high-level text prompt guidance, serve as structured "semantic sketches" over time for the video diffusion model, which has its strength at synthesizing high-fidelity visual details. Plan-X effectively integrates the strength of language models in multimodal in-context reasoning and planning, together with the strength of diffusion models in photorealistic video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially reduces visual hallucinations and enables fine-grained, instruction-aligned video generation consistent with multimodal context.

### [208] [Breaking the Likelihood-Quality Trade-off in Diffusion Models by Merging Pretrained Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19434)
*Yasin Esfandiari,Stefan Bauer,Sebastian U. Stich,Andrea Dittadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a sampling technique for diffusion models that combines experts for image quality and likelihood to overcome the trade-off in existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image diffusion models struggle with a trade-off between generating perceptually realistic images and achieving high data likelihood during training.

Method: The paper proposes a plug-and-play sampling technique that utilizes two pretrained diffusion experts, switching between them at different noise levels during the denoising process, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed method improves or matches both likelihood and sample quality on datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32 compared to using each expert individually.

Conclusion: Expert switching is shown to effectively break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models, enhancing both image fidelity and statistical alignment.

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models.

*Haodong Chen,Xianfei Han,Qwen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyM-UNet, a hybrid model combining CNNs and Visual Mamba modules, which improves global anatomical structure segmentation and achieves state-of-the-art results on the ISIC 2018 dataset for medical diagnosis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNNs are limited by their local receptive fields, making it difficult to capture global anatomical structures necessary for precise organ and lesion segmentation.

Method: HyM-UNet utilizes a Hierarchical Encoder combining convolutional modules for high-frequency texture detail preservation and Visual Mamba modules for global modeling. It also introduces Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection (MGF-Skip) to suppress background noise and enhance feature perception.

Result: Experiments on the ISIC 2018 dataset showcase significant improvements in Dice coefficient and IoU over current methods, with lower parameter counts and faster inference.

Conclusion: HyM-UNet proves to be effective and robust for medical segmentation tasks, handling complex shapes and scale variations while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate organ and lesion segmentation is a critical prerequisite for computer-aided diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), constrained by their local receptive fields, often struggle to capture complex global anatomical structures. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel hybrid architecture, HyM-UNet, designed to synergize the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the efficient global modeling capabilities of Mamba. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical Encoder that utilizes convolutional modules in the shallow stages to preserve high-frequency texture details, while introducing Visual Mamba modules in the deep stages to capture long-range semantic dependencies with linear complexity. To bridge the semantic gap between the encoder and the decoder, we propose a Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection (MGF-Skip). This module leverages deep semantic features as gating signals to dynamically suppress background noise within shallow features, thereby enhancing the perception of ambiguous boundaries. We conduct extensive experiments on public benchmark dataset ISIC 2018. The results demonstrate that HyM-UNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice coefficient and IoU, while maintaining lower parameter counts and inference latency. This validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in handling medical segmentation tasks characterized by complex shapes and scale variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of image deraining, particularly due to the complex multi-scale physics of rain and its interaction with scenes.

Method: The approach employs a three-stage sequential restoration architecture, incorporating dynamic PSF mechanisms to simulate rain optics and adaptive gated fusion for cross-stage integration.

Result: SD-PSFNet demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image deraining on datasets such as Rain100H (33.12dB/0.9371) and RealRain-1k, effectively handling complex scenes.

Conclusion: SD-PSFNet offers a physics-aware deraining solution that excels in both performance metrics and real-world complex rainfall scenarios.

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for vision applications but is challenged by the complex multi-scale physics of rain and its coupling with scenes. To address this challenge, a novel approach inspired by multi-stage image restoration is proposed, incorporating Point Spread Function (PSF) mechanisms to reveal the image degradation process while combining dynamic physical modeling with sequential feature fusion transfer, named SD-PSFNet. Specifically, SD-PSFNet employs a sequential restoration architecture with three cascaded stages, allowing multiple dynamic evaluations and refinements of the degradation process estimation. The network utilizes components with learned PSF mechanisms to dynamically simulate rain streak optics, enabling effective rain-background separation while progressively enhancing outputs through novel PSF components at each stage. Additionally, SD-PSFNet incorporates adaptive gated fusion for optimal cross-stage feature integration, enabling sequential refinement from coarse rain removal to fine detail restoration. Our model achieves state-of-the-art PSNR/SSIM metrics on Rain100H (33.12dB/0.9371), RealRain-1k-L (42.28dB/0.9872), and RealRain-1k-H (41.08dB/0.9838). In summary, SD-PSFNet demonstrates excellent capability in complex scenes and dense rainfall conditions, providing a new physics-aware approach to image deraining.

*Siteng Ma,Honghui Du,Prateek Mathur,Brendan S. Kelly,Ronan P. Killeen,Aonghus Lawlor,Ruihai Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LMI-AL, a Deep Active Learning method for efficient detection of changes in longitudinal medical imaging, significantly minimizing the need for labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling longitudinal medical images is resource-intensive, due to the complexity of identifying changes across multiple time points, creating a need for efficient labeling methods.

Method: The proposed LMI-AL framework pairs and differences 2D slices from baseline and follow-up 3D images. It uses Deep Active Learning to iteratively select informative pairs for labeling, minimizing manual annotation.

Result: LMI-AL requires less than 8% labeling of data and achieves performance comparable to models trained on fully labeled datasets.

Conclusion: LMI-AL effectively reduces labeling effort while delivering competitive model performance, guiding the future application of DAL in longitudinal imaging tasks.

Abstract: Detecting changes in longitudinal medical imaging using deep learning requires a substantial amount of accurately labeled data. However, labeling these images is notably more costly and time-consuming than labeling other image types, as it requires labeling across various time points, where new lesions can be minor, and subtle changes are easily missed. Deep Active Learning (DAL) has shown promise in minimizing labeling costs by selectively querying the most informative samples, but existing studies have primarily focused on static tasks like classification and segmentation. Consequently, the conventional DAL approach cannot be directly applied to change detection tasks, which involve identifying subtle differences across multiple images. In this study, we propose a novel DAL framework, named Longitudinal Medical Imaging Active Learning (LMI-AL), tailored specifically for longitudinal medical imaging. By pairing and differencing all 2D slices from baseline and follow-up 3D images, LMI-AL iteratively selects the most informative pairs for labeling using DAL, training a deep learning model with minimal manual annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that, with less than 8% of the data labeled, LMI-AL can achieve performance comparable to models trained on fully labeled datasets. We also provide a detailed analysis of the method's performance, as guidance for future research. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HelenMa9998/Longitudinal_AL.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoadBench, a systematic benchmark to evaluate multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) fine-grained spatial understanding in urban scenarios, focusing on road markings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited attention given to the fine-grained spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs in complex urban environments.

Method: Developed RoadBench, a benchmark with six tasks and 9,121 manual test cases using BEV and FPV image inputs, assessing recognition, reasoning, and integration of spatial scope understanding.

Result: RoadBench revealed significant shortcomings in existing MLLMs in fine-grained spatial reasoning, sometimes performing worse than rule-based or random baselines.

Conclusion: RoadBench provides a challenging framework and insights for advancing MLLMs' spatial understanding capabilities, with resources made available in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in general spatial understanding and reasoning. However, their fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities in complex urban scenarios have not received significant attention in the fields of both research and industry. To fill this gap, we focus primarily on road markings as a typical example of fine-grained spatial elements under urban scenarios, given the essential role of the integrated road traffic network they form within cities. Around road markings and urban traffic systems, we propose RoadBench, a systematic benchmark that comprehensively evaluates MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities using BEV and FPV image inputs. This benchmark comprises six tasks consisting of 9,121 strictly manually verified test cases. These tasks form a systematic evaluation framework that bridges understanding at local spatial scopes to global reasoning. They not only test MLLMs' capabilities in recognition, joint understanding, and reasoning but also assess their ability to integrate image information with domain knowledge. After evaluating 14 mainstream MLLMs, we confirm that RoadBench is a challenging benchmark for MLLMs while revealing significant shortcomings in existing MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities within urban scenarios. In certain tasks, their performance even falls short of simple rule-based or random selection baselines. These findings, along with RoadBench itself, will contribute to the comprehensive advancement of spatial understanding capabilities for MLLMs. The benchmark code, example datasets, and raw evaluation results are available in the supplementary material.

### [214] [State and Scene Enhanced Prototypes for Weakly Supervised Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18012)
*Jiaying Zhou,Qingchao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses weakly supervised open-vocabulary object detection (WS-OVOD) through enriched semantic prototypes and contextual alignment strategies to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address limitations in current WS-OVOD methods, specifically static prototypes failing to capture visual variations and mismatches between text embeddings and visual proposals.

Method: The paper introduces State-Enhanced Semantic Prototypes (SESP) to capture intra-class variations and Scene-Augmented Pseudo Prototypes (SAPP) to improve contextual alignment between visual and textual data.

Result: By combining SESP and SAPP, the method achieves enhanced semantic prototype richness and improved visual-textual alignment, resulting in better WS-OVOD performance.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies demonstrate significant potential in resolving challenges in WS-OVOD, advancing both object recognition capabilities and semantic consistency in detection tasks.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to generalize object recognition to novel categories, while Weakly Supervised OVOD (WS-OVOD) extends this by combining box-level annotations with image-level labels. Despite recent progress, two critical challenges persist in this setting. First, existing semantic prototypes, even when enriched by LLMs, are static and limited, failing to capture the rich intra-class visual variations induced by different object states (e.g., a cat's pose). Second, the standard pseudo-box generation introduces a semantic mismatch between visual region proposals (which contain context) and object-centric text embeddings. To tackle these issues, we introduce two complementary prototype enhancement strategies. To capture intra-class variations in appearance and state, we propose the State-Enhanced Semantic Prototypes (SESP), which generates state-aware textual descriptions (e.g., "a sleeping cat") to capture diverse object appearances, yielding more discriminative prototypes. Building on this, we further introduce Scene-Augmented Pseudo Prototypes (SAPP) to address the semantic mismatch. SAPP incorporates contextual semantics (e.g., "cat lying on sofa") and utilizes a soft alignment mechanism to promote contextually consistent visual-textual representations. By integrating SESP and SAPP, our method effectively enhances both the richness of semantic prototypes and the visual-textual alignment, achieving notable improvements.

Result: LTCs and CfCs showed lower MAE, faster convergence, smaller model sizes, and better query times compared to baselines, albeit with slightly lower Pearson correlation.

Conclusion: LTCs and CfCs are effective solutions for edge-deployment tasks in vision prosthetics due to their efficiency and adaptability with limited data.

Abstract: This work explores Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) and Closed-form Continuous-time Networks (CfCs) for modeling retinal ganglion cell activity in tiger salamanders across three datasets. Compared to a convolutional baseline and an LSTM, both architectures achieved lower MAE, faster convergence, smaller model sizes, and favorable query times, though with slightly lower Pearson correlation. Their efficiency and adaptability make them well suited for scenarios with limited data and frequent retraining, such as edge deployments in vision prosthetics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActDistill is a framework to make Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation faster and computationally lighter by distilling knowledge from a large model into a smaller, efficient student model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational inefficiencies and inference delays of VLA models, which hinder their use in robotic manipulation.

Method: ActDistill uses a teacher-student model framework where a large VLA model (teacher) transfers its action prediction capabilities to a smaller model (student) via graph-structured encapsulation and dynamic routing strategies.

Result: ActDistill achieves similar or better performance compared to full-scale VLA models while reducing computation by over 50% and offering up to 1.67 times speedup in performance.

Conclusion: ActDistill proposes an efficient approach to enhance the usability of VLA models in embodied intelligence tasks, making them more computationally practical without significant performance trade-off.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive flexibility and generalization, yet their deployment in robotic manipulation remains limited by heavy computational overhead and inference latency. In this work, we present ActDistill, a general action-guided self-derived distillation framework that transfers the action prediction capability of any existing VLA model to a lightweight counterpart. Unlike previous efficiency strategies that primarily emphasize vision-language correlations, ActDistill leverages action priors to guide knowledge transfer and model compression, achieving action-oriented efficiency for VLA models. Specifically, we employ a well-trained VLA model as the teacher and introduce a graph-structured encapsulation strategy to explicitly model the hierarchical evolution of action prediction. The student model, derived from the graph-encapsulated teacher, is further equipped with a dynamic router that adaptively selects computation paths based on action prediction demands, guided by hierarchical graph-informed supervision to ensure smooth and efficient evolution. During inference, graph-related auxiliary components are removed, allowing the student to execute only dynamically routed layers and predict high-precision actions with minimal computation and latency. Experiments on embodied benchmarks demonstrate that ActDistill achieves comparable or superior performance to full-scale VLA models while reducing computation by over 50% with up to 1.67 times speedup, thereby establishing a general paradigm toward efficient embodied intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a nonlinear state predictive control model, MambaX, for image super-resolution that overcomes limitations of existing methods by introducing dynamic state learning, multimodal fusion, and progressive learning, demonstrating superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in image super-resolution approaches, notably error propagation and inflexible linear mapping, by developing a method for better generalization and control during reconstruction stages.

Method: MambaX employs dynamic learning of nonlinear state parameters, state cross-control for multimodal fusion, and progressive transitional learning to improve super-resolution tasks in diverse domains and modalities.

Result: The model exhibits superior performance in single-image and multimodal fusion-based SR tasks, enabling advanced modeling across various dimensions and modalities.

Conclusion: MambaX effectively enhances the super-resolution process by mitigating error propagation and heterogeneity while improving flexibility and control, paving the way for broader applications.

Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) is a critical technology for overcoming the inherent hardware limitations of sensors. However, existing approaches mainly focus on directly enhancing the final resolution, often neglecting effective control over error propagation and accumulation during intermediate stages. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising approach that can represent the entire reconstruction process as a state sequence with multiple nodes, allowing for intermediate intervention. Nonetheless, its fixed linear mapper is limited by a narrow receptive field and restricted flexibility, which hampers its effectiveness in fine-grained images. To address this, we created a nonlinear state predictive control model \textbf{MambaX} that maps consecutive spectral bands into a latent state space and generalizes the SR task by dynamically learning the nonlinear state parameters of control equations. Compared to existing sequence models, MambaX 1) employs dynamic state predictive control learning to approximate the nonlinear differential coefficients of state-space models; 2) introduces a novel state cross-control paradigm for multimodal SR fusion; and 3) utilizes progressive transitional learning to mitigate heterogeneity caused by domain and modality shifts. Our evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of the dynamic spectrum-state representation model in both single-image SR and multimodal fusion-based SR tasks, highlighting its substantial potential to advance spectrally generalized modeling across arbitrary dimensions and modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a first unified imaging noise model for Event Frame Hybrid Sensors, describing APS and EVS noise and proposing a simulator for realistic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event Frame Hybrid Sensors provide imaging benefits combining APS and EVS capabilities but suffer from complex noise patterns that are unmodeled.

Method: The authors developed a statistics-based unified noise model, a calibration pipeline to estimate parameters, and HESIM simulator for noise-aware data generation.

Result: The model is well-validated, and the simulator accurately reproduces real sensor noise, enabling improvements in imaging tasks like interpolation and deblurring.

Conclusion: The unified noise model and simulator support realistic evaluations of hybrid sensors, enhancing real-world imaging applications.

Abstract: Event frame hybrid sensors integrate an Active Pixel Sensor (APS) and an Event Vision Sensor (EVS) within a single chip, combining the high dynamic range and low latency of the EVS with the rich spatial intensity information from the APS. While this tight integration offers compact, temporally precise imaging, the complex circuit architecture introduces non-trivial noise patterns that remain poorly understood and unmodeled. In this work, we present the first unified, statistics-based imaging noise model that jointly describes the noise behavior of APS and EVS pixels. Our formulation explicitly incorporates photon shot noise, dark current noise, fixed-pattern noise, and quantization noise, and links EVS noise to illumination level and dark current. Based on this formulation, we further develop a calibration pipeline to estimate noise parameters from real data and offer a detailed analysis of both APS and EVS noise behaviors. Finally, we propose HESIM, a statistically grounded simulator that generates RAW frames and events under realistic, jointly calibrated noise statistics. Experiments on two hybrid sensors validate our model across multiple imaging tasks (e.g., video frame interpolation and deblurring), demonstrating strong transfer from simulation to real data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraFlux is a text-to-image generation framework designed for native 4K resolution across diverse aspect ratios that solves critical failure issues through coordinated data-model co-design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image generation models struggle with achieving native 4K resolution due to coupled issues in positional encoding, compression, and optimization.

Method: UltraFlux integrates advancements such as Resonance 2D RoPE positional encoding, improved VAE post-training reconstruction, an SNR-Aware Huber Wavelet objective, and a stage-wise aesthetic curriculum learning regime.

Result: UltraFlux delivers high-quality 4K text-to-image results across various aspect ratios, outperforming open-source models and matching or exceeding proprietary solutions.

Conclusion: By addressing interconnected design and optimization challenges, UltraFlux establishes a robust solution for native high-resolution and aspect-diverse text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have recently delivered strong text-to-image generation around 1K resolution, but we show that extending them to native 4K across diverse aspect ratios exposes a tightly coupled failure mode spanning positional encoding, VAE compression, and optimization. Tackling any of these factors in isolation leaves substantial quality on the table. We therefore take a data-model co-design view and introduce UltraFlux, a Flux-based DiT trained natively at 4K on MultiAspect-4K-1M, a 1M-image 4K corpus with controlled multi-AR coverage, bilingual captions, and rich VLM/IQA metadata for resolution- and AR-aware sampling. On the model side, UltraFlux couples (i) Resonance 2D RoPE with YaRN for training-window-, frequency-, and AR-aware positional encoding at 4K; (ii) a simple, non-adversarial VAE post-training scheme that improves 4K reconstruction fidelity; (iii) an SNR-Aware Huber Wavelet objective that rebalances gradients across timesteps and frequency bands; and (iv) a Stage-wise Aesthetic Curriculum Learning strategy that concentrates high-aesthetic supervision on high-noise steps governed by the model prior. Together, these components yield a stable, detail-preserving 4K DiT that generalizes across wide, square, and tall ARs. On the Aesthetic-Eval at 4096 benchmark and multi-AR 4K settings, UltraFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines across fidelity, aesthetic, and alignment metrics, and-with a LLM prompt refiner-matches or surpasses the proprietary Seedream 4.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap in robot interaction by enabling inference on physical properties beyond geometry and appearance, critical for better understanding and safer interactions.

Method: PhysGS uses Bayesian inference over 3D Gaussian splats to refine material and property beliefs iteratively based on new observations, modeling uncertainties to improve interpretation.

Result: PhysGS significantly enhances physical property estimation accuracy: mass estimation improves by 22.8%, Shore hardness error is reduced by 61.2%, and kinetic friction error declines by 18.1%.

Conclusion: PhysGS successfully integrates 3D reconstruction, uncertainty modeling, and physical reasoning, providing dense and accurate physical property estimation in a unified framework.

Abstract: Understanding physical properties such as friction, stiffness, hardness, and material composition is essential for enabling robots to interact safely and effectively with their surroundings. However, existing 3D reconstruction methods focus on geometry and appearance and cannot infer these underlying physical properties. We present PhysGS, a Bayesian-inferred extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that estimates dense, per-point physical properties from visual cues and vision--language priors. We formulate property estimation as Bayesian inference over Gaussian splats, where material and property beliefs are iteratively refined as new observations arrive. PhysGS also models aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, enabling uncertainty-aware object and scene interpretation. Across object-scale (ABO-500), indoor, and outdoor real-world datasets, PhysGS improves accuracy of the mass estimation by up to 22.8%, reduces Shore hardness error by up to 61.2%, and lowers kinetic friction error by up to 18.1% compared to deterministic baselines. Our results demonstrate that PhysGS unifies 3D reconstruction, uncertainty modeling, and physical reasoning in a single, spatially continuous framework for dense physical property estimation.

Result: IE-Critic-R1 demonstrated stronger alignment with human perception in experiments compared to existing metrics, emphasizing subjective quality in image editing.

Conclusion: The benchmark and method enhance the evaluation of text-driven image editing, improving alignment with human subjective opinions, and are made openly accessible for further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven image editing have been significant, yet the task of accurately evaluating these edited images continues to pose a considerable challenge. Different from the assessment of text-driven image generation, text-driven image editing is characterized by simultaneously conditioning on both text and a source image. The edited images often retain an intrinsic connection to the original image, which dynamically change with the semantics of the text. However, previous methods tend to solely focus on text-image alignment or have not well aligned with human perception. In this work, we introduce the Text-driven Image Editing Benchmark suite (IE-Bench) to enhance the assessment of text-driven edited images. IE-Bench includes a database contains diverse source images, various editing prompts and the corresponding edited results from different editing methods, and nearly 4,000 samples with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) provided by 15 human subjects. Furthermore, we introduce IE-Critic-R1, which, benefiting from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), provides more comprehensive and explainable quality assessment for text-driven image editing that aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate IE-Critic-R1's superior subjective-alignments on the text-driven image editing task compared with previous metrics. Related data and codes are available to the public.

### [222] [Hierarchical Semi-Supervised Active Learning for Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18058)
*Wei Huang,Zhitong Xiong,Chenying Liu,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Hierarchical Semi-Supervised Active Learning (HSSAL) framework for remote sensing tasks. It effectively combines semi-supervised learning and active learning to maximize label efficiency using limited annotations and vast unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in remote sensing require significant labeled data, which is expensive to generate, while vast amounts of unlabeled imagery remain unutilized.

Method: The proposed HSSAL framework integrates semi-supervised learning and hierarchical active learning in iterative cycles. SSL refines the model using both labeled and unlabeled data, and HAL selects informative samples based on scalability, diversity, and uncertainty using a clustering strategy.

Result: Experiments on three remote sensing datasets demonstrate HSSAL's effectiveness, achieving over 95% accuracy with minimal labeled data (8%, 4%, and 2% for three datasets). It regularly outperforms other methods relying solely on SSL or AL.

Conclusion: HSSAL efficiently exploits unlabeled data, significantly reducing the reliance on annotations while maintaining high accuracy in remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models in remote sensing (RS) strongly depends on the availability of high-quality labeled data. However, collecting large-scale annotations is costly and time-consuming, while vast amounts of unlabeled imagery remain underutilized. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semi-Supervised Active Learning (HSSAL) framework that integrates semi-supervised learning (SSL) and a novel hierarchical active learning (HAL) in a closed iterative loop. In each iteration, SSL refines the model using both labeled data through supervised learning and unlabeled data via weak-to-strong self-training, improving feature representation and uncertainty estimation. Guided by the refined representations and uncertainty cues of unlabeled samples, HAL then conducts sample querying through a progressive clustering strategy, selecting the most informative instances that jointly satisfy the criteria of scalability, diversity, and uncertainty. This hierarchical process ensures both efficiency and representativeness in sample selection. Extensive experiments on three benchmark RS scene classification datasets, including UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, demonstrate that HSSAL consistently outperforms SSL- or AL-only baselines. Remarkably, with only 8%, 4%, and 2% labeled training data on UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, respectively, HSSAL achieves over 95% of fully-supervised accuracy, highlighting its superior label efficiency through informativeness exploitation of unlabeled data. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/RS-SSAL.

*Dayong Liu,Chao Xu,Weihong Chen,Suyu Zhang,Juncheng Wang,Jiankang Deng,Baigui Sun,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CFG-Bench to evaluate multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) proficiency in generating actionable knowledge required for fine-grained embodied physical interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on high-level planning or spatial reasoning but overlook fine-grained action intelligence required for embodied physical interactions.

Method: CFG-Bench consists of 1,368 curated videos and 19,562 multi-modal question-answer pairs targeting four cognitive abilities to systematically test these capabilities.

Result: Leading MLLMs exhibit significant limitations in producing detailed physical interaction instructions and higher-order reasoning, although supervised fine-tuning improves performance on established benchmarks.

Conclusion: CFG-Bench effectively identifies gaps in MLLM capabilities, offering a path to improve embodied agents in complex environments.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results as decision-making engines for embodied agents operating in complex, physical environments. However, existing benchmarks often prioritize high-level planning or spatial reasoning, leaving the fine-grained action intelligence required for embodied physical interaction underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CFG-Bench, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate this crucial capability. CFG-Bench consists of 1,368 curated videos paired with 19,562 three-modalities question-answer pairs targeting four cognitive abilities: 1) Physical Interaction, 2) Temporal-Causal Relation, 3) Intentional Understanding, and 4) Evaluative Judgment. Together, these dimensions provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to translate visual observations into actionable knowledge, moving beyond mere surface-level recognition. Our comprehensive evaluation on CFG-Bench reveals that leading MLLMs struggle to produce detailed instructions for physical interactions and exhibit profound limitations in the higher-order reasoning of intention and evaluation. Moreover, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our data demonstrates that teaching an MLLMs to articulate fine-grained actions directly translates to significant performance gains on established embodied benchmarks. Our analysis highlights these limitations and offers insights for developing more capable and grounded embodied agents.

Abstract: Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is a critical premalignant lesion whose accurate histopathological diagnosis is challenging. Early detection is essential to prevent progression to invasive cervical adenocarcinoma. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based virtual pathology assistant capable of distinguishing AIS from normal cervical gland histology using the CAISHI dataset, which contains 2240 expert-labeled H&E images (1010 normal and 1230 AIS). All images underwent Macenko stain normalization and patch-based preprocessing to enhance morphological feature representation. An EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network was trained using class-balanced sampling and focal loss to address dataset imbalance and emphasize difficult examples. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.7323, with an F1-score of 0.75 for the Abnormal class and 0.71 for the Normal class. Grad-CAM heatmaps demonstrated biologically interpretable activation patterns, highlighting nuclear atypia and glandular crowding consistent with AIS morphology. The trained model was deployed in a Gradio-based virtual diagnostic assistant. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight, interpretable AI systems for cervical gland pathology, with potential applications in screening workflows, education, and low-resource settings.

*Jianhang Yao,Yongbin Zheng,Siqi Lu,Wanying Xu,Peng Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents VK-Det, an open-vocabulary aerial object detection framework leveraging visual knowledge, achieving superior performance without additional supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome semantic bias in open-vocabulary aerial object detection caused by text-dependent methods and to effectively identify novel objects beyond predefined categories.

Method: VK-Det leverages the vision encoder's region perception for fine-grained localization, introduces prototype-aware pseudo-labeling for inter-class decision boundaries, and links detection regions to latent categories via clustering and prototype matching.

Result: VK-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 30.1 mAP on DIOR and 23.3 mAP on DOTA, surpassing even methods with extra supervision.

Conclusion: Visual knowledge can successfully guide open-vocabulary object detection, enabling better generalization to novel objects and reducing reliance on external text supervision.

Abstract: To identify objects beyond predefined categories, open-vocabulary aerial object detection (OVAD) leverages the zero-shot capabilities of visual-language models (VLMs) to generalize from base to novel categories. Existing approaches typically utilize self-learning mechanisms with weak text supervision to generate region-level pseudo-labels to align detectors with VLMs semantic spaces. However, text dependence induces semantic bias, restricting open-vocabulary expansion to text-specified concepts. We propose $\textbf{VK-Det}$, a $\textbf{V}$isual $\textbf{K}$nowledge-guided open-vocabulary object $\textbf{Det}$ection framework $\textit{without}$ extra supervision. First, we discover and leverage vision encoder's inherent informative region perception to attain fine-grained localization and adaptive distillation. Second, we introduce a novel prototype-aware pseudo-labeling strategy. It models inter-class decision boundaries through feature clustering and maps detection regions to latent categories via prototype matching. This enhances attention to novel objects while compensating for missing supervision. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance, achieving 30.1 $\mathrm{mAP}^{N}$ on DIOR and 23.3 $\mathrm{mAP}^{N}$ on DOTA, outperforming even extra supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents EMFE pipeline, a low compute machine learning approach for malaria cell classification outperforming deep learning methods in efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if complex neural networks are necessary for simple binary medical image classification tasks like malaria diagnosis and to create a more computationally efficient method.

Method: EMFE pipeline uses morphological features extracted (number of non-background pixels and holes within cells) from the NIH Malaria dataset with Logistic Regression, Random Forest models compared to ResNet18, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet.

Result: Logistic Regression achieved 94.80% accuracy with low model size and latency; an ensemble boosted accuracy to 97.15%. Deep learning models required larger storage (13.6MB-44.7MB) and higher inference times (68ms).

Conclusion: Feature engineering with lightweight models can achieve deep learning level performance for malaria classification, enabling transparency, reproducibility, and feasibility in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Deep learning models have high computational needs and lack interpretability but are often the first choice for medical image classification tasks. This study addresses whether complex neural networks are essential for the simple binary classification task of malaria. We introduce the Extracted Morphological Feature Engineered (EMFE) pipeline, a transparent, reproducible, and low compute machine learning approach tailored explicitly for simple cell morphology, designed to achieve deep learning performance levels on a simple CPU only setup with the practical aim of real world deployment.
  Methods: The study used the NIH Malaria Cell Images dataset, with two features extracted from each cell image: the number of non background pixels and the number of holes within the cell. Logistic Regression and Random Forest were compared against ResNet18, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet across accuracy, model size, and CPU inference time. An ensemble model was created by combining Logistic Regression and Random Forests to achieve higher accuracy while retaining efficiency.
  Results: The single variable Logistic Regression model achieved a test accuracy of 94.80 percent with a file size of 1.2 kB and negligible inference latency (2.3 ms). The two stage ensemble improved accuracy to 97.15 percent. In contrast, the deep learning methods require 13.6 MB to 44.7 MB of storage and show significantly higher inference times (68 ms).
  Conclusion: This study shows that a compact feature engineering approach can produce clinically meaningful classification performance while offering gains in transparency, reproducibility, speed, and deployment feasibility. The proposed pipeline demonstrates that simple interpretable features paired with lightweight models can serve as a practical diagnostic solution for environments with limited computational resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a workflow for automatically generating 3D anatomical models using physical organ models and a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck in obtaining 3D anatomical models for surgical planning and training due to legal, ethical, and technical constraints, especially for soft tissue organs like the prostate.

Method: The process involves using biomimetic hydrogel-based prostate models with imaging contrast, endoscopic surgical simulation, customized ultrasound scanning, neural network-based segmentation, and a GAN to extend 3D model data.

Result: The workflow successfully generates accurate 3D prostate mesh models via neural network segmentation, outperforming conventional computer vision methods.

Conclusion: The innovative approach using physical organ models and machine learning provides a solution for creating high-quality 3D anatomical data for medical applications.

Abstract: Surgical planning and training based on machine learning requires a large amount of 3D anatomical models reconstructed from medical imaging, which is currently one of the major bottlenecks. Obtaining these data from real patients and during surgery is very demanding, if even possible, due to legal, ethical, and technical challenges. It is especially difficult for soft tissue organs with poor imaging contrast, such as the prostate. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel workflow for automated 3D anatomical data generation using data obtained from physical organ models. We additionally use a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to obtain a manifold of 3D models useful for other downstream machine learning tasks that rely on 3D data. We demonstrate our workflow using an artificial prostate model made of biomimetic hydrogels with imaging contrast in multiple zones. This is used to physically simulate endoscopic surgery. For evaluation and 3D data generation, we place it into a customized ultrasound scanner that records the prostate before and after the procedure. A neural network is trained to segment the recorded ultrasound images, which outperforms conventional, non-learning-based computer vision techniques in terms of intersection over union (IoU). Based on the segmentations, a 3D mesh model is reconstructed, and performance feedback is provided.

### [228] [Together, Then Apart: Revisiting Multimodal Survival Analysis via a Min-Max Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18089)
*Wenjing Liu,Qin Ren,Wen Zhang,Yuewei Lin,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the TTA framework for multi-modal survival analysis by balancing alignment and modality-specific distinctiveness, improving representation and analysis outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for survival analysis combining histopathology and genomics focus excessively on aligning modalities, causing loss of modality-specific details and representation collapse.

Method: The TTA framework integrates shared and modality-specific representations using a min-max optimization approach. It employs two stages: Together (aligning embeddings using optimal transport) and Apart (preserving modality-specific features with anchors and contrastive regularization).

Result: Extensive experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that TTA surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, yielding more robust and meaningful analyses.

Conclusion: The study establishes a novel theoretical perspective and effective methodology for achieving both alignment and distinctiveness in multi-modal survival analysis, paving the way for better biological insights and interpretations.

Abstract: Integrating heterogeneous modalities such as histopathology and genomics is central to advancing survival analysis, yet most existing methods prioritize cross-modal alignment through attention-based fusion mechanisms, often at the expense of modality-specific characteristics. This overemphasis on alignment leads to representation collapse and reduced diversity. In this work, we revisit multi-modal survival analysis via the dual lens of alignment and distinctiveness, positing that preserving modality-specific structure is as vital as achieving semantic coherence. In this paper, we introduce Together-Then-Apart (TTA), a unified min-max optimization framework that simultaneously models shared and modality-specific representations. The Together stage minimizes semantic discrepancies by aligning embeddings via shared prototypes, guided by an unbalanced optimal transport objective that adaptively highlights informative tokens. The Apart stage maximizes representational diversity through modality anchors and a contrastive regularizer that preserve unique modality information and prevent feature collapse. Extensive experiments on five TCGA benchmarks show that TTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Beyond empirical gains, our formulation provides a new theoretical perspective of how alignment and distinctiveness can be jointly achieved in for robust, interpretable, and biologically meaningful multi-modal survival analysis.

### [229] [Versatile Recompression-Aware Perceptual Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18090)
*Mingwei He,Tongda Xu,Xingtong Ge,Ming Sun,Chao Zhou,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for perceptual image super-resolution (SR) that accounts for compression artifacts using a pre-trained diffusion model and optimized training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve perceptual image super-resolution methods by addressing the artifacts introduced during image recompression, which are currently overlooked despite their widespread impact on storage and transmission.

Method: The authors present a framework called VRPSR that treats compression as a conditional text-to-image generation task, employing a pre-trained diffusion model as a codec simulator, and propose training techniques tailored for compression-aware perceptual SR.

Result: The VRPSR framework achieves significant bitrate reduction (over 10%) when used with Real-ESRGAN and S3Diff under various compression codecs (H.264, H.265, H.266). It also enables joint optimization of SR and post-processing models after recompression.

Conclusion: VRPSR demonstrates that incorporating compression awareness in perceptual SR frameworks can enhance both reconstructed image quality and compression performance, offering new avenues for integrated SR and compression improvement.

Abstract: Perceptual image super-resolution (SR) methods restore degraded images and produce sharp outputs. In practice, those outputs are usually recompressed for storage and transmission. Ignoring recompression is suboptimal as the downstream codec might add additional artifacts to restored images. However, jointly optimizing SR and recompression is challenging, as the codecs are not differentiable and vary in configuration. In this paper, we present Versatile Recompression-Aware Perceptual Super-Resolution (VRPSR), which makes existing perceptual SR aware of versatile compression. First, we formulate compression as conditional text-to-image generation and utilize a pre-trained diffusion model to build a generalizable codec simulator. Next, we propose a set of training techniques tailored for perceptual SR, including optimizing the simulator using perceptual targets and adopting slightly compressed images as the training target. Empirically, our VRPSR saves more than 10\% bitrate based on Real-ESRGAN and S3Diff under H.264/H.265/H.266 compression. Besides, our VRPSR facilitates joint optimization of the SR and post-processing model after recompression.

### [230] [Spotlight: Identifying and Localizing Video Generation Errors Using VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18102)
*Aditya Chinchure,Sahithya Ravi,Pushkar Shukla,Vered Shwartz,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spotlight, a task for identifying and describing errors in text-to-video (T2V) models, assesses errors in state-of-the-art models, and proposes solutions to improve error localization and identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for T2V models lack the ability to localize and identify nuanced errors occurring in videos generated by modern models.

Method: Spotlight was developed as a task to analyze errors in T2V-generated videos. Videos were generated using 200 textual prompts and three T2V models. Errors were classified and annotated across six types. Current vision-language models were evaluated on Spotlight with strategies proposed to enhance performance.

Result: Predominant errors include adherence to prompts and physics, lasting longer, while appearance-disappearance and body pose issues are more transient. Vision-language models perform poorly compared to humans on identifying errors, but inference time strategies improved model performance significantly.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a critical gap in the evaluation of T2V models, proposes the Spotlight task to address it, and showcases its utility for refining video generation evaluation and reward modeling systems.

Abstract: Current text-to-video models (T2V) can generate high-quality, temporally coherent, and visually realistic videos. Nonetheless, errors still often occur, and are more nuanced and local compared to the previous generation of T2V models. While current evaluation paradigms assess video models across diverse dimensions, they typically evaluate videos holistically without identifying when specific errors occur or describing their nature. We address this gap by introducing Spotlight, a novel task aimed at localizing and explaining video-generation errors. We generate 600 videos using 200 diverse textual prompts and three state-of-the-art video generators (Veo 3, Seedance, and LTX-2), and annotate over 1600 fine-grained errors across six types, including motion, physics, and prompt adherence. We observe that adherence and physics errors are predominant and persist across longer segments, whereas appearance-disappearance and body pose errors manifest in shorter segments. We then evaluate current VLMs on Spotlight and find that VLMs lag significantly behind humans in error identification and localization in videos. We propose inference-time strategies to probe the limits of current VLMs on our task, improving performance by nearly 2x. Our task paves a way forward to building fine-grained evaluation tools and more sophisticated reward models for video generators.

TL;DR: MM-Det++ is introduced as a novel system to detect diffusion-generated videos effectively, utilizing spatio-temporal and multimodal approaches alongside a unified learning module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing prevalence of diffusion-generated videos raises concerns in information security, creating an urgent need to develop robust detection tools, as earlier methods primarily revolve around image-level detection and lack general solutions for videos.

Method: MM-Det++ integrates a Spatio-Temporal branch using Frame-Centric Vision Transformer (FC-ViT), a Multimodal branch leveraging reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), and a Unified Multimodal Learning (UML) module to coherently combine data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate MM-Det++'s superior performance in detecting diffusion-generated videos, supported by the introduction of a comprehensive Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF) dataset for further research.

Conclusion: MM-Det++ showcases the potential of unified multimodal forgery detection methods, highlighting the effectiveness of combining spatio-temporal and semantic representations.

Abstract: The proliferation of videos generated by diffusion models has raised increasing concerns about information security, highlighting the urgent need for reliable detection of synthetic media. Existing methods primarily focus on image-level forgery detection, leaving generic video-level forgery detection largely underexplored. To advance video forensics, we propose a consolidated multimodal detection algorithm, named MM-Det++, specifically designed for detecting diffusion-generated videos. Our approach consists of two innovative branches and a Unified Multimodal Learning (UML) module. Specifically, the Spatio-Temporal (ST) branch employs a novel Frame-Centric Vision Transformer (FC-ViT) to aggregate spatio-temporal information for detecting diffusion-generated videos, where the FC-tokens enable the capture of holistic forgery traces from each video frame. In parallel, the Multimodal (MM) branch adopts a learnable reasoning paradigm to acquire Multimodal Forgery Representation (MFR) by harnessing the powerful comprehension and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which discerns the forgery traces from a flexible semantic perspective. To integrate multimodal representations into a coherent space, a UML module is introduced to consolidate the generalization ability of MM-Det++. In addition, we also establish a large-scale and comprehensive Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF) dataset to advance research in video forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MM-Det++ and highlight the effectiveness of unified multimodal forgery learning in detecting diffusion-generated videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaPerceiver introduces a novel transformer architecture allowing adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens, offering efficiency without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer architectures struggle to adapt to varied hardware and latency demands in real-world scenarios, often focusing on a single computation axis.

Method: AdaPerceiver combines a dynamic architecture model with unified adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens, joined with an efficient joint training regime.

Result: AdaPerceiver improves throughput and computation efficiency across multiple tasks, including 36% higher throughput in image classification compared to FlexiViT-L and significantly fewer FLOPs in dense prediction tasks.

Conclusion: AdaPerceiver successfully demonstrates adaptive computation in a unified framework, balancing flexibility and accuracy to meet diverse deployment constraints.

Abstract: Modern transformer architectures achieve remarkable performance across tasks and domains but remain rigid in how they allocate computation at inference time. Real-world deployment often requires models to adapt to diverse hardware and latency constraints, yet most approaches to dynamic computation focus on a single axis -- such as reducing the number of tokens. We present a novel capability: AdaPerceiver, the first transformer architecture with unified adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens within a single model. We propose an architecture that supports adaptivity along these axes. We couple this with an efficient joint training regime that ensures the model maintains performance across its various configurations. We evaluate AdaPerceiver on image classification, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation tasks. On image classification, AdaPerceiver expands the accuracy-throughput Pareto front. It achieves 85.4% accuracy while yielding 36% higher throughput than FlexiViT-L. On dense prediction, AdaPerceiver matches ViT-H/14 while having $\sim$26x fewer encoder FLOPs (floating-point operations) on semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Finally, we show how AdaPerceiver equipped with a policy can maintain ImageNet1K accuracy ($\pm0.1$ percentage points) while reducing FLOPs by $24-33$%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited multi-view consistency in existing frame-wise vision models used for 3D vision tasks.

Method: Muskie processes multiple views simultaneously and utilizes a pretext task to reconstruct masked content in one view using geometric correspondences from other views, along with an aggressive masking strategy.

Result: Muskie achieves higher multi-view correspondence accuracy compared to DINO and enhances performance on 3D tasks like camera pose estimation and pointmap reconstruction.

Conclusion: Muskie introduces a novel approach to multi-view vision modeling, showing improved multi-view consistency and demonstrating its effectiveness in downstream 3D tasks.

Abstract: We present Muskie, a native multi-view vision backbone designed for 3D vision tasks. Unlike existing models, which are frame-wise and exhibit limited multi-view consistency, Muskie is designed to process multiple views simultaneously and introduce multi-view consistency in pre-training stage. Muskie is trained to reconstruct heavily masked content in one view by finding and utilizing geometric correspondences from other views. Through this pretext task and our proposed aggressive masking strategy, the model implicitly to learn view-invariant features and develop strong geometric understanding without any 3D supervision. Compared with state-of-the-art frame-wise backbones such as DINO, Muskie achieves higher multi-view correspondence accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using Muskie as a backbone consistently enhances performance on downstream 3D tasks, including camera pose estimation and pointmap reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PromptMoE, a framework for improved zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) using a compositional approach to prompt learning, resulting in state-of-the-art performance across 15 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language model-based ZSAD methods struggle with representational bottlenecks and overfitting, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen anomalies.

Method: PromptMoE utilizes a pool of expert prompts and a Visually-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically combine these prompts for instance-specific analysis, enhancing semantic richness and generalization.

Result: PromptMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZSAD tasks across 15 datasets from industrial and medical domains, showcasing its robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: PromptMoE's compositional approach effectively addresses limitations in traditional ZSAD methods, enabling improved identification and localization of anomalies in unseen object classes.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) aims to identify and localize anomalous regions in images of unseen object classes. While recent methods based on vision-language models like CLIP show promise, their performance is constrained by existing prompt engineering strategies. Current approaches, whether relying on single fixed, learnable, or dense dynamic prompts, suffer from a representational bottleneck and are prone to overfitting on auxiliary data, failing to generalize to the complexity and diversity of unseen anomalies. To overcome these limitations, we propose $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$. Our core insight is that robust ZSAD requires a compositional approach to prompt learning. Instead of learning monolithic prompts, $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$ learns a pool of expert prompts, which serve as a basis set of composable semantic primitives, and a visually-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically combine them for each instance. Our framework materializes this concept through a Visually-Guided Mixture of Prompt (VGMoP) that employs an image-gated sparse MoE to aggregate diverse normal and abnormal expert state prompts, generating semantically rich textual representations with strong generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets in industrial and medical domains demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the sub-optimal generalization of learning-based MVS approaches caused by fixed parameters trained on limited data distributions, and combine the adaptability benefits of optimization-based methods without sacrificing scalability.

Method: It proposes the MVS-TTA framework, which uses a self-supervised, cross-view consistency loss during inference and a meta-auxiliary learning strategy during training to optimize test-time adaptation. The approach is designed to be model-agnostic and minimally invasive to existing architectures.

Result: MVS-TTA consistently improved performance across standard and cross-dataset generalization scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness even with state-of-the-art MVS models. The results were validated on datasets like DTU and BlendedMVS.

Conclusion: This paper showcases the first application of optimization-based test-time adaptation in learning-based MVS with meta-learning, combining benefits of both paradigms and achieving strong improvements. The proposed framework is scalable, effective, and adaptable to various MVS architectures.

Abstract: Recent learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods are data-driven and have achieved remarkable progress due to large-scale training data and advanced architectures. However, their generalization remains sub-optimal due to fixed model parameters trained on limited training data distributions. In contrast, optimization-based methods enable scene-specific adaptation but lack scalability and require costly per-scene optimization. In this paper, we propose MVS-TTA, an efficient test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that enhances the adaptability of learning-based MVS methods by bridging these two paradigms. Specifically, MVS-TTA employs a self-supervised, cross-view consistency loss as an auxiliary task to guide inference-time adaptation. We introduce a meta-auxiliary learning strategy to train the model to benefit from auxiliary-task-based updates explicitly. Our framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of MVS methods with minimal architectural changes. Extensive experiments on standard datasets (DTU, BlendedMVS) and a challenging cross-dataset generalization setting demonstrate that MVS-TTA consistently improves performance, even when applied to state-of-the-art MVS models. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate optimization-based test-time adaptation into learning-based MVS using meta-learning.

*Ming Zhong,Yuanlei Wang,Liuzhou Zhang,Arctanx An,Renrui Zhang,Hao Liang,Ming Lu,Ying Shen,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VCU-Bridge, a framework supporting hierarchical visual connotation understanding for MLLMs. HVCU-Bench benchmarks this, showing issues as reasoning goes higher-level. Improvements in low-level reasoning enhance overall model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle to mimic human-like integration of visual information where low-level perception and high-level reasoning merge seamlessly. Existing methods do not fully address this gap.

Method: This paper proposes VCU-Bridge, which incorporates a human-like hierarchical reasoning framework with traceable evidence-to-inference pathways, and builds HVCU-Bench for level-wise evaluation. A data pipeline with MCTS is used for instruction tuning.

Result: Experiments reveal decreasing performance for MLLMs at higher reasoning levels. Low-level capability reinforcement leads to improvements in hierarchical tasks and general benchmarks, with notable gains on MMStar.

Conclusion: Strengthening foundational perceptual reasoning addresses bottlenecks in hierarchical visual understanding for MLLMs and enhances their general task performance.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmarks, their processing paradigm differs from the human ability to integrate visual information. Unlike humans who naturally bridge details and high-level concepts, models tend to treat these elements in isolation. Prevailing evaluation protocols often decouple low-level perception from high-level reasoning, overlooking their semantic and causal dependencies, which yields non-diagnostic results and obscures performance bottlenecks. We present VCU-Bridge, a framework that operationalizes a human-like hierarchy of visual connotation understanding: multi-level reasoning that advances from foundational perception through semantic bridging to abstract connotation, with an explicit evidence-to-inference trace from concrete cues to abstract conclusions. Building on this framework, we construct HVCU-Bench, a benchmark for hierarchical visual connotation understanding with explicit, level-wise diagnostics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate a consistent decline in performance as reasoning progresses to higher levels. We further develop a data generation pipeline for instruction tuning guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and show that strengthening low-level capabilities yields measurable gains at higher levels. Interestingly, it not only improves on HVCU-Bench but also brings benefits on general benchmarks (average +2.53%), especially with substantial gains on MMStar (+7.26%), demonstrating the significance of the hierarchical thinking pattern and its effectiveness in enhancing MLLM capabilities.

### [237] [Bias Is a Subspace, Not a Coordinate: A Geometric Rethinking of Post-hoc Debiasing in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18123)
*Dachuan Zhao,Weiyue Li,Zhenda Shen,Yushu Qiu,Bowen Xu,Haoyu Chen,Yongchao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel debiasing method called Subspace Projection Debiasing (SPD) to address demographic biases in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), proving its effectiveness across multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models increasingly display demographic biases that undermine fairness and distort their alignment between vision and language, impacting downstream tasks.

Method: The authors propose SPD, which removes bias by identifying and eliminating the bias-carrying subspace in VLMs while preserving semantic components. This differs from prior coordinate-wise methods that struggle with limitations like incomplete bias removal.

Result: Through experiments on multimodal tasks, SPD improves fairness metrics by 18.5% on average compared to baselines and retains nearly the same task performance.

Conclusion: SPD represents a significant advancement for fairer and more reliable Vision-Language Models by addressing bias comprehensively and geometrically, ensuring robust debiasing capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become indispensable for multimodal reasoning, yet their representations often encode and amplify demographic biases, resulting in biased associations and misaligned predictions in downstream tasks. Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{S}$ubspace $\textbf{P}$rojection $\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation validate the effectiveness of SPD: our method achieves more robust debiasing with an average improvement of $18.5\%$ across four fairness metrics, while maintaining minimal loss in task performance compared to the best debiasing baseline.

*Ruicong Liu,Yifei Huang,Liangyang Ouyang,Caixin Kang,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SFHand, a novel real-time language-guided 3D hand forecasting framework, and EgoHaFL, a corresponding large-scale dataset for synchronous hand pose and language instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack the ability to handle real-time 3D hand forecasting and fail to incorporate task-intent language guidance, limiting their effectiveness in applications like AR and assistive robotics.

Method: SFHand utilizes a streaming autoregressive architecture with an ROI-enhanced memory layer to dynamically predict 3D hand states using continuous video and language instructions.

Result: SFHand achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing prior methods by up to 35.8% in 3D hand forecasting accuracy and increasing task success rates by up to 13.4% in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SFHand effectively bridges the gap between real-time hand forecasting and language-guided task adaptability, demonstrating cutting-edge performance and practical utility for human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Real-time 3D hand forecasting is a critical component for fluid human-computer interaction in applications like AR and assistive robotics. However, existing methods are ill-suited for these scenarios, as they typically require offline access to accumulated video sequences and cannot incorporate language guidance that conveys task intent. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SFHand, the first streaming framework for language-guided 3D hand forecasting. SFHand autoregressively predicts a comprehensive set of future 3D hand states, including hand type, 2D bounding box, 3D pose, and trajectory, from a continuous stream of video and language instructions. Our framework combines a streaming autoregressive architecture with an ROI-enhanced memory layer, capturing temporal context while focusing on salient hand-centric regions. To enable this research, we also introduce EgoHaFL, the first large-scale dataset featuring synchronized 3D hand poses and language instructions. We demonstrate that SFHand achieves new state-of-the-art results in 3D hand forecasting, outperforming prior work by a significant margin of up to 35.8%. Furthermore, we show the practical utility of our learned representations by transferring them to downstream embodied manipulation tasks, improving task success rates by up to 13.4% on multiple benchmarks.

*Xiaofan Li,Yanpeng Sun,Chenming Wu,Fan Duan,YuAn Wang,Weihao Bo,Yumeng Zhang,Dingkang Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores a data-efficient method for instruction-driven image editing by leveraging video pre-training priors, significantly reducing the need for curated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the high cost and data demands of state-of-the-art instruction-driven image editing pipelines.

Method: The proposed method views image editing as a degenerate temporal process and transfers priors from video pre-training for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to leading baselines but requires only about one percent of the typical supervision.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling enables efficient fine-tuning for image editing, presenting a promising alternative to costly high-quality data curation.

Abstract: We observe that recent advances in multimodal foundation models have propelled instruction-driven image generation and editing into a genuinely cross-modal, cooperative regime. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art editing pipelines remain costly: beyond training large diffusion/flow models, they require curating massive high-quality triplets of \{instruction, source image, edited image\} to cover diverse user intents. Moreover, the fidelity of visual replacements hinges on how precisely the instruction references the target semantics. We revisit this challenge through the lens of temporal modeling: if video can be regarded as a full temporal process, then image editing can be seen as a degenerate temporal process. This perspective allows us to transfer single-frame evolution priors from video pre-training, enabling a highly data-efficient fine-tuning regime. Empirically, our approach matches the performance of leading open-source baselines while using only about one percent of the supervision demanded by mainstream editing models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCALER, a framework integrating consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision for enhanced label-deficient concealed object segmentation (LDCOS), showing consistent performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited performance in LDCOS due to target concealment and annotations scarcity, and explore mutual enhancement between consistency-based methods and SAM.

Method: The authors propose SCALER, a collaborative framework optimizing a mean-teacher segmenter and learnable SAM through two alternating phases involving pseudo-label reliability and SAM enhancement.

Result: SCALER significantly improves performance across 8 semi- and weakly-supervised COS tasks, demonstrating its ability to enhance both lightweight segmenters and large models.

Conclusion: SCALER successfully unifies consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision into a general paradigm, proving effective for label-scarce conditions and showing promise for further scalability.

Abstract: Existing methods for label-deficient concealed object segmentation (LDCOS) either rely on consistency constraints or Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. However, their performance remains limited due to the intrinsic concealment of targets and the scarcity of annotations. This study investigates two key questions: (1) Can consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision be jointly integrated to better exploit complementary information and enhance the segmenter? and (2) beyond that, can the segmenter in turn guide SAM through reciprocal supervision, enabling mutual improvement? To answer these questions, we present SCALER, a unified collaborative framework toward LDCOS that jointly optimizes a mean-teacher segmenter and a learnable SAM. SCALER operates in two alternating phases. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}}, the segmenter is optimized under fixed SAM supervision using entropy-based image-level and uncertainty-based pixel-level weighting to select reliable pseudo-label regions and emphasize harder examples. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}}, SAM is updated via augmentation invariance and noise resistance losses, leveraging its inherent robustness to perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that SCALER yields consistent performance gains across eight semi- and weakly-supervised COS tasks. The results further suggest that SCALER can serve as a general training paradigm to enhance both lightweight segmenters and large foundation models under label-scarce conditions. Code will be released.

TL;DR: WaveletMamba is a framework that improves astrophysical imaging by employing wavelet decomposition, state-space modeling, and unique bias corrections achieving high efficiency and accuracy in image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improvements are needed in scaling astrophysical imaging systems to maintain accuracy and efficiency in classification and predictions, despite the traditional trade-offs between high resolution and computational efficiency.

Method: WaveletMamba integrates wavelet decomposition with state-space models, adds mathematical regularization, employs multi-level bias correction combining HK distance and Color-Aware Weighting, and explores the phenomena of Resolution Multistability.

Result: WaveletMamba attains 81.72% accuracy at 64x64 resolution with low computational use, and consistent accuracy across resolutions with improved bias correction leading to error and outlier reductions.

Conclusion: Mathematically rigorous approaches like WaveletMamba can transform scientific AI by achieving unprecedented efficiency and enhanced data treatment in domains like astrophysics and computer vision.

Abstract: Astronomical imaging confronts an efficiency-resolution tradeoff that limits large-scale morphological classification and redshift prediction. We introduce WaveletMamba, a theory-driven framework integrating wavelet decomposition with state-space modeling, mathematical regularization, and multi-level bias correction. WaveletMamba achieves 81.72% +/- 0.53% classification accuracy at 64x64 resolution with only 3.54M parameters, delivering high-resolution performance (80.93% +/- 0.27% at 244x244) at low-resolution inputs with 9.7x computational efficiency gains. The framework exhibits Resolution Multistability, where models trained on low-resolution data achieve consistent accuracy across different input scales despite divergent internal representations. The framework's multi-level bias correction synergizes HK distance (distribution-level optimal transport) with Color-Aware Weighting (sample-level fine-tuning), achieving 22.96% Log-MSE improvement and 26.10% outlier reduction without explicit selection function modeling. Here, we show that mathematical rigor enables unprecedented efficiency and comprehensive bias correction in scientific AI, bridging computer vision and astrophysics to revolutionize interdisciplinary scientific discovery.

*Chunming He,Rihan Zhang,Zheng Chen,Bowen Yang,CHengyu Fang,Yunlong Lin,Fengyang Xiao,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents UnfoldLDM, a deep unfolding network integrated with latent diffusion models for blind image restoration (BIR). It addresses two main challenges: dependency on known degradation models and over-smoothing effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing deep unfolding networks, which are ineffective for BIR due to degradation-specific dependency and over-smoothing bias.

Method: A multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module is used for estimating degradation and a degradation-resistant latent diffusion model (DR-LDM) is integrated to improve texture recovery using an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer).

Result: UnfoldLDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on various BIR tasks, enhancing downstream applications. It is also compatible with existing DUN frameworks.

Conclusion: UnfoldLDM overcomes major issues in DUNs for BIR by introducing innovative designs that enhance restoration quality while producing visually rich results. Its compatibility makes it a plug-and-play solution.

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) combine the interpretability of model-based methods with the learning ability of deep networks, yet remain limited for blind image restoration (BIR). Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR. In each stage, UnfoldLDM employs a multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module as the gradient descent step. MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, our design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods, serving as a plug-and-play framework. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the first method, Affinity Explainer, to interpret matching-based Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) models and highlights the importance of interpretability in understanding the model's behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) models, despite their effectiveness, lack interpretability which is crucial for understanding model behavior and aiding in selecting support sets, especially in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces the Affinity Explainer, an interpretability method leveraging FSS models' structural properties, generating attribution maps that identify pixel contributions to segmentation predictions using matching scores across multiple feature levels.

Result: The Affinity Explainer outperformed adapted standard attribution methods through comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets. It provided structured and coherent explanations, aligning with model architectures and revealing effective diagnostic patterns.

Conclusion: The research establishes the foundation for interpretable FSS, enhancing model understanding and reliability in few-shot segmentation tasks, with source code openly accessible for further exploration.

Abstract: Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) models achieve strong performance in segmenting novel classes with minimal labeled examples, yet their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. While explainable AI has advanced significantly in standard computer vision tasks, interpretability in FSS remains virtually unexplored despite its critical importance for understanding model behavior and guiding support set selection in data-scarce scenarios. This paper introduces the first dedicated method for interpreting matching-based FSS models by leveraging their inherent structural properties. Our Affinity Explainer approach extracts attribution maps that highlight which pixels in support images contribute most to query segmentation predictions, using matching scores computed between support and query features at multiple feature levels. We extend standard interpretability evaluation metrics to the FSS domain and propose additional metrics to better capture the practical utility of explanations in few-shot scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on FSS benchmark datasets, using different models, demonstrate that our Affinity Explainer significantly outperforms adapted standard attribution methods. Qualitative analysis reveals that our explanations provide structured, coherent attention patterns that align with model architectures and and enable effective model diagnosis. This work establishes the foundation for interpretable FSS research, enabling better model understanding and diagnostic for more reliable few-shot segmentation systems.

*Chunming He,Rihan Zhang,Dingming Zhang,Fengyang Xiao,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Nested Unfolding Network (NUN) for concealed object segmentation, addressing limitations of previous methods in handling image degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for concealed object segmentation face challenges due to coupling background estimation with image restoration and relying on unrealistic pre-defined degradation types.

Method: A DUN-in-DUN framework is proposed, where a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) is embedded within a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). Mutual refinement, dynamic degradation estimation, and image-quality assessment are included.

Result: Extensive experiments prove NUN's superior performance on clean and degraded benchmarks.

Conclusion: NUN successfully decouples restoration from segmentation and introduces robust degradation handling, marking a significant advancement in real-world concealed object segmentation.

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have recently advanced concealed object segmentation (COS) by modeling segmentation as iterative foreground-background separation. However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness. Extensive experiments show that NUN achieves a leading place on both clean and degraded benchmarks. Code will be released.

Motivation: Create an embodied AI system capable of generating future egocentric video frames based on body motion for simulating, predicting, and planning actions.

Method: Develop and train a video prediction diffusion model, EgoControl, which conditions video generation on novel 3D pose representations integrating articulated movements and camera dynamics.

Result: EgoControl successfully generates temporally coherent, pose-aligning, and visually realistic egocentric video frames.

Conclusion: EgoControl enhances controllable egocentric video generation, benefiting embodied AI systems for simulations and action planning.

Abstract: Egocentric video generation with fine-grained control through body motion is a key requirement towards embodied AI agents that can simulate, predict, and plan actions. In this work, we propose EgoControl, a pose-controllable video diffusion model trained on egocentric data. We train a video prediction model to condition future frame generation on explicit 3D body pose sequences. To achieve precise motion control, we introduce a novel pose representation that captures both global camera dynamics and articulated body movements, and integrate it through a dedicated control mechanism within the diffusion process. Given a short sequence of observed frames and a sequence of target poses, EgoControl generates temporally coherent and visually realistic future frames that align with the provided pose control. Experimental results demonstrate that EgoControl produces high-quality, pose-consistent egocentric videos, paving the way toward controllable embodied video simulation and understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies children's word learning based on alignment between linguistic and visual experiences using CLIP models on egocentric infant videos, finding aligned moments are rare and variable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Children face challenges in understanding the association between words and objects in their environment. Research often assumes that co-occurrences of words and visual referents aid learning, but this assumption has not been deeply investigated due to the difficulty of manual data annotation.

Method: The authors use CLIP models to analyze visual-linguistic alignment in egocentric videos from infants' perspectives, validating their scores with human judgments and applying these metrics to infant-perspective video corpora.

Result: The study found that ideal instances of alignment between linguistic terms and visible referents are rare in real-life infant scenarios compared to machine learning datasets. There is variability in this alignment both within individual children and across groups.

Conclusion: Alignment between linguistic and visual information is limited in a child's everyday environment, posing challenges for existing models of word learning. The findings highlight the importance of considering multimodal input variability and suggest a novel method for studying these dynamics.

Abstract: Figuring out which objects or concepts words refer to is a central language learning challenge for young children. Most models of this process posit that children learn early object labels from co-occurrences of words and their referents that occur when someone around them talks about an object in the immediate physical environment. But how aligned in time are children's visual and linguistic experiences during everyday learning? To date, answers to this question have been limited by the need for labor-intensive manual annotations of vision-language co-occurrences. Here, we evaluate the use of contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) models to automatically characterize vision-language alignment in egocentric videos taken from the infant perspective in home environments. After validating CLIP alignment scores using human alignment judgments, we apply this metric to a large corpus of infant-perspective videos. We show that idealized aligned moments for learning (e.g., "look at the ball" with a ball present in the child's view) are relatively rare in children's everyday experiences compared to modern machine learning datasets, and highlight variability in alignment both within and across children. These findings suggest that infrequent alignment is a constraint for models describing early word learning and offer a new method for investigating children's multimodal environment.

*Mukai Yu,Mosam Dabhi,Liuyue Xie,Sebastian Scherer,László A. Jeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Unified Spherical Frontend (USF), a lens-agnostic framework for transforming images from wide FoV cameras to a unit-sphere representation, bypassing traditional planar CNN limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of planar CNNs when applied to wide field-of-view cameras, such as misrepresentation of physical adjacency, sensitivity to global rotations, and inefficiency of frequency-domain spherical CNNs.

Method: The paper proposes a modular framework, USF, that maps images from calibrated cameras to spherical representations and performs spherical resampling, convolution, and pooling directly in the spatial domain.

Result: The USF demonstrates efficiency in processing high-resolution spherical imagery, robustness under extreme lens distortions, varying FoV and rotations, and supports zero-shot generalization across different lens types with minimal performance drop.

Conclusion: USF addresses the mismatch between planar CNNs and wide FoV cameras by enabling a resolution-agnostic and rotation-equivariant method that avoids the inefficiencies of harmonic transforms, providing robust and generalizable results across tasks.

Abstract: Modern perception increasingly relies on fisheye, panoramic, and other wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, yet most pipelines still apply planar CNNs designed for pinhole imagery on 2D grids, where image-space neighborhoods misrepresent physical adjacency and models are sensitive to global rotations. Frequency-domain spherical CNNs partially address this mismatch but require costly spherical harmonic transforms that constrain resolution and efficiency. We introduce the Unified Spherical Frontend (USF), a lens-agnostic framework that transforms images from any calibrated camera into a unit-sphere representation via ray-direction correspondences, and performs spherical resampling, convolution, and pooling directly in the spatial domain. USF is modular: projection, location sampling, interpolation, and resolution control are fully decoupled. Its distance-only spherical kernels offer configurable rotation-equivariance (mirroring translation-equivariance in planar CNNs) while avoiding harmonic transforms entirely. We compare standard planar backbones with their spherical counterparts across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on synthetic (Spherical MNIST) and real-world datasets (PANDORA, Stanford 2D-3D-S), and stress-test robustness to extreme lens distortions, varying FoV, and arbitrary rotations. USF processes high-resolution spherical imagery efficiently and maintains less than 1% performance drop under random test-time rotations, even without rotational augmentation, and even enables zero-shot generalization from one lens type to unseen wide-FoV lenses with minimal performance degradation.

*Yutong Wu,Yifan Wang,Qining Zhang,Chuan Zhou,Lei Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a generative AI approach, CorrFlowNet, to virtually predict one-year follow-up CT scans for early lung cancer diagnosis, bypassing extensive clinical follow-ups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of distinguishing early malignancy signals from benign conditions and improve early lung cancer diagnosis outcomes, reducing delays caused by annual clinical follow-ups.

Method: CorrFlowNet employs a correlational autoencoder to analyze dynamics between baseline and follow-up CT scans, combined with a flow matching algorithm in latent space using a neural ODE and an auxiliary classifier for enhanced accuracy.

Result: The evaluations show that CorrFlowNet significantly improves lung nodule risk assessment compared to existing models and achieves diagnostic accuracy comparable to real clinical CT follow-ups.

Conclusion: CorrFlowNet has the potential to provide more accurate and timely tools for early lung cancer detection, reducing reliance on annual clinical examinations.

Abstract: Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and early diagnosis is critical because the survival rate declines sharply once the disease progresses to advanced stages. However, achieving an early diagnosis remains challenging, particularly in distinguishing subtle early signals of malignancy from those of benign conditions. In clinical practice, a patient with a high risk may need to undergo an initial baseline and several annual follow-up examinations (e.g., CT scans) before receiving a definitive diagnosis, which can result in missing the optimal treatment. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been increasingly used for early diagnosis of lung cancer, but most existing algorithms focus on radiomic features extraction from single early-stage CT scans. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models for image generation, this paper proposes a generative method, named CorrFlowNet, which creates a virtual, one-year follow-up CT scan after the initial baseline scan. This virtual follow-up would allow for an early detection of malignant/benign nodules, reducing the need to wait for clinical follow-ups. During training, our approach employs a correlational autoencoder to encode both early baseline and follow-up CT images into a latent space that captures the dynamics of nodule progression as well as the correlations between them, followed by a flow matching algorithm on the latent space with a neural ordinary differential equation. An auxiliary classifier is used to further enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Evaluations on a real clinical dataset show our method can significantly improve downstream lung nodule risk assessment compared with existing baseline models. Moreover, its diagnostic accuracy is comparable with real clinical CT follow-ups, highlighting its potential to improve cancer diagnosis.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing Document VQA systems that either focus on textual accuracy at the expense of poor spatial grounding or sacrifice accuracy for interpretability, especially critical in high-stakes applications.

Method: The study introduces ARIAL, a modular framework that divides Document VQA into structured subtasks: text extraction (using TrOCR), context selection (using semantic search), answer generation (via Gemma 3-27B), and bounding-box localization for spatial grounding. The modular approach enables independent optimization and auditability.

Result: ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, SROIE) with substantial improvements in both textual accuracy and spatial precision compared to the prior best method.

Conclusion: ARIAL demonstrates that orchestrating specialized tools with a modular approach can simultaneously enhance interpretability and performance, suggesting a viable path toward more trustworthy and explainable document AI systems.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to not only extract accurate textual answers but also precisely localize them within document images, a capability critical for interpretability in high-stakes applications. However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA. Our work demonstrates how agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems.

### [250] [InfiniBench: Infinite Benchmarking for Visual Spatial Reasoning with Customizable Scene Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18200)
*Haoming Wang,Qiyao Xue,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfiniBench introduces a benchmark generator for vision-language models, enabling infinite generation of customizable 3D scenes with control over complexity for spatial reasoning evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language benchmarks are limited, offering low customizability for testing scene complexity or isolating specific VLM failure modes.

Method: InfiniBench uses an LLM-based framework for scene descriptions, a cluster-based layout optimizer for complex scenes, and a task-aware camera trajectory optimizer for video rendering.

Result: InfiniBench surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generating realistic and physically plausible scenes, especially in high-complexity scenarios.

Conclusion: InfiniBench enables advanced benchmarking for spatial reasoning tasks, supporting detailed VLM evaluation across diverse complexities.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to have abilities of spatial reasoning with diverse scene complexities, but evaluating such abilities is difficult due to the lack of benchmarks that are not only diverse and scalable but also fully customizable. Existing benchmarks offer limited customizability over the scene complexity and are incapable of isolating and analyzing specific VLM failure modes under distinct spatial conditions. To address this gap, instead of individually presenting benchmarks for different scene complexities, in this paper we present InfiniBench, a fully automated, customizable and user-friendly benchmark generator that can synthesize a theoretically infinite variety of 3D scenes with parameterized control on scene complexity. InfiniBench uniquely translates scene descriptions in natural language into photo-realistic videos with complex and physically plausible 3D layouts. This is achieved through three key innovations: 1) a LLM-based agentic framework that iteratively refines procedural scene constraints from scene descriptions; 2) a flexible cluster-based layout optimizer that generates dense and cluttered scenes previously intractable for procedural methods; and 3) a task-aware camera trajectory optimization method that renders scenes into videos with full object coverage as VLM input. Experiments demonstrate that InfiniBench outperforms state-of-the-art procedural and LLM-based 3D generation methods in prompt fidelity and physical plausibility, especially in high-complexity scenarios. We further showcased the usefulness of InfiniBench, by generating benchmarks for representative spatial reasoning tasks including measurement, perspective-taking and spatiotemporal tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study develops the DIA framework to generate high-quality synthetic images of day 5 blastocysts, addressing issues like data scarcity and imbalance to improve AI models in in vitro fertilization (IVF) assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inconsistency and subjectivity in morphological assessment of day 5 blastocysts in IVF clinics. The study aims to overcome challenges of data scarcity, imbalance, and privacy constraints while improving AI-based embryo evaluation.

Method: The method involves creating the Diffusion Based Imaging Model for Artificial Blastocysts (DIA), a set of latent diffusion models that generate realistic images of blastocysts, conditioned on specific morphological categories and focal depth. The performance was evaluated using several rigorous tests, including FID, memorization tests, embryologist assessments, and classification tasks.

Result: The results demonstrate that DIA models produce high-fidelity synthetic embryo images, indistinguishable from real ones by embryologists. These synthetic images improved classification accuracy in imbalanced datasets and enhanced performance in balanced datasets, with synthetic data successfully replacing part of real data without significant accuracy loss.

Conclusion: DIA effectively mitigates data scarcity and class imbalance in embryo datasets, producing clinically valuable synthetic images. This can improve AI systems' accuracy, fairness, and standardization for embryo assessment in IVF clinics.

Abstract: The success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) at many clinics relies on the accurate morphological assessment of day 5 blastocysts, a process that is often subjective and inconsistent. While artificial intelligence can help standardize this evaluation, models require large, diverse, and balanced datasets, which are often unavailable due to data scarcity, natural class imbalance, and privacy constraints. Existing generative embryo models can mitigate these issues but face several limitations, such as poor image quality, small training datasets, non-robust evaluation, and lack of clinically relevant image generation for effective data augmentation. Here, we present the Diffusion Based Imaging Model for Artificial Blastocysts (DIA) framework, a set of latent diffusion models trained to generate high-fidelity, novel day 5 blastocyst images. Our models provide granular control by conditioning on Gardner-based morphological categories and z-axis focal depth. We rigorously evaluated the models using FID, a memorization metric, an embryologist Turing test, and three downstream classification tasks. Our results show that DIA models generate realistic images that embryologists could not reliably distinguish from real images. Most importantly, we demonstrated clear clinical value. Augmenting an imbalanced dataset with synthetic images significantly improved classification accuracy (p < 0.05). Also, adding synthetic images to an already large, balanced dataset yielded statistically significant performance gains, and synthetic data could replace up to 40% of real data in some cases without a statistically significant loss in accuracy. DIA provides a robust solution for mitigating data scarcity and class imbalance in embryo datasets. By generating novel, high-fidelity, and controllable synthetic images, our models can improve the performance, fairness, and standardization of AI embryo assessment tools.

*Moazzam Umer Gondal,Hamad Ul Qudous,Daniya Siddiqui,Asma Ahmad Farhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a retrieval-augmented system for generating descriptive captions and hashtags for fashion imagery using multi-garment detection, attribute reasoning, and LLM prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance visually grounded text generation for fashion, addressing challenges with attribute fidelity and generalization found in traditional end-to-end models.

Method: The system employs a YOLO-based garment detector, k-means clustering for color extraction, CLIP-FAISS for attribute inference, and an LLM to generate captions and hashtags based on factual evidence packs.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the system’s strong performance in garment detection (mAP@0.5: 0.71), high attribute coverage (0.80), and improved caption quality and hashtag alignment compared to a BLIP baseline.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented generation proves effective for producing accurate and scalable automated fashion content, showing promise for broader applications in the domain.

Abstract: This paper introduces the retrieval-augmented framework for automatic fashion caption and hashtag generation, combining multi-garment detection, attribute reasoning, and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting. The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation.

Gaipl,Andrea Wittig,Rainer Fietkau,Christoph Bert,Stefanie Corradini,Florian Putz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-phase deep learning model for differentiating radiation necrosis (RN) from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). It leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) for pre-training on large-scale unlabeled MRI datasets and achieves high accuracy compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiating RN from tumor progression is challenging due to invasiveness of histopathology and limited labeled data for conventional deep learning methods, necessitating scalable and non-invasive solutions.

Method: The researchers employed SSL-driven pre-training of a Vision Transformer (ViT) using 10,167 unlabeled T1CE MRI sub-volumes, followed by fine-tuning for RN classification using multimodal MRI data and segmentation masks, and tested on MOLAB and an external center dataset.

Result: The SSL model achieved high accuracy with AUC of 0.916 (same-center) and 0.764 (external validation), outperforming fully supervised and radiomics-based approaches. Multimodal integration further enhanced performance, and attention maps demonstrated clinical interpretability.

Conclusion: A self-supervised multimodal deep learning approach with routine MRI imaging and clinical data represents an effective, interpretable, and clinically accessible solution for differentiating RN from tumor progression, warranting further validation studies.

Abstract: Background: Differentiating radiation necrosis (RN) from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remains a critical challenge in brain metastases. While histopathology represents the gold standard, its invasiveness limits feasibility. Conventional supervised deep learning approaches are constrained by scarce biopsy-confirmed training data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) overcomes this by leveraging the growing availability of large-scale unlabeled brain metastases imaging datasets. Methods: In a two-phase deep learning strategy inspired by the foundation model paradigm, a Vision Transformer (ViT) was pre-trained via SSL on 10,167 unlabeled multi-source T1CE MRI sub-volumes. The pre-trained ViT was then fine-tuned for RN classification using a two-channel input (T1CE MRI and segmentation masks) on the public MOLAB dataset (n=109) using 20% of datasets as same-center held-out test set. External validation was performed on a second-center test cohort (n=28). Results: The self-supervised model achieved an AUC of 0.916 on the same-center test set and 0.764 on the second center test set, surpassing the fully supervised ViT (AUC 0.624/0.496; p=0.001/0.008) and radiomics (AUC 0.807/0.691; p=0.005/0.014). Multimodal integration further improved performance (AUC 0.947/0.821; p=0.073/0.001). Attention map visualizations enabled interpretability showing the model focused on clinically relevant lesion subregions. Conclusion: Large-scale pre-training on increasingly available unlabeled brain metastases datasets substantially improves AI model performance. A two-phase multimodal deep learning strategy achieved high accuracy in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression using only routine T1CE MRI and standard clinical data, providing an interpretable, clinically accessible solution that warrants further validation.

*Mingi Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses MRI acquisition time reduction using an innovative deep learning framework for reconstructing high-quality images from undersampled k-space data without pre-computed coil sensitivity maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI scans are time-intensive, reducing patient throughput and increasing motion artifacts. Accelerated methods like parallel MRI techniques are needed to reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled data.

Method: The method introduces a two-module end-to-end deep learning framework: a Coil Sensitivity Map (CSM) estimation module and a U-Net-based MRI reconstruction module, operating on undersampled k-space measurements.

Result: The framework yields visually smoother reconstructions compared to SENSE, matching visual quality despite lower PSNR/SSIM metrics. Challenges including spatial misalignment are highlighted.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates potential for improving MRI acquisition efficiency but requires further optimization to tackle spatial misalignment and enhance reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisitions require extensive scan times, limiting patient throughput and increasing susceptibility to motion artifacts. Accelerated parallel MRI techniques reduce acquisition time by undersampling k-space data, but require robust reconstruction methods to recover high-quality images. Traditional approaches like SENSE require both undersampled k-space data and pre-computed coil sensitivity maps. We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly estimates coil sensitivity maps and reconstructs images from only undersampled k-space measurements at 4x acceleration. Our two-module architecture consists of a Coil Sensitivity Map (CSM) estimation module and a U-Net-based MRI reconstruction module. We evaluate our method on multi-coil brain MRI data from 10 subjects with 8 echoes each, using 2x SENSE reconstructions as ground truth. Our approach produces visually smoother reconstructions compared to conventional SENSE output, achieving comparable visual quality despite lower PSNR/SSIM metrics. We identify key challenges including spatial misalignment between different acceleration factors and propose future directions for improved reconstruction quality.

*Yogesh Kulkarni,Pooyan Fazli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EgoVITA, a reinforcement learning framework for multimodal large language models, focusing on egocentric reasoning via structured planning and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reasoning about intentions and actions in egocentric videos characterized by partial observability and dynamic viewpoints.

Method: EgoVITA employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alternate between egocentric planning (predicting step-by-step actions) and exocentric verification (checking visual and logical consistency).

Result: EgoVITA significantly outperformed benchmarks on egocentric reasoning tasks, such as EgoBlind (+7.7 improvement) and EgoOrient (+4.4 improvement), while generalizing effectively to third-person tasks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances structured egocentric reasoning and visual grounding, showcasing its effectiveness in improving multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning about intentions and actions from a first-person (egocentric) perspective remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike third-person (exocentric) videos that capture scenes from an outside observer, egocentric videos reflect the actor's continuously changing viewpoint, introducing partial observability, limited field of view, and self-referenced motion. We introduce $\textbf{EgoVITA}$, a reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to reason through structured planning and verification. Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EgoVITA alternates between two stages: (1) an $\textbf{egocentric planning phase}$, where the model reasons from a first-person viewpoint to predict a step-by-step plan of future actions, and (2) an $\textbf{exocentric verification phase}$, where it switches to a third-person perspective to check the visual and logical consistency of that plan. Through GRPO, the model learns to make plans that are causally predictive of upcoming visual observations, leading to more coherent and visually grounded reasoning. EgoVITA achieves significant gains on egocentric reasoning tasks, outperforming the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by $\mathbf{+7.7}$ on EgoBlind and $\mathbf{+4.4}$ on EgoOrient, while maintaining strong generalization on exocentric video tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniFlow, a LiDAR scene flow model that unifies training on multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both seen and unseen datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a technique that generalizes 3D motion estimation across varied and unseen LiDAR sensors, overcoming the limitations of single-sensor training in prior methods.

Method: The authors analyzed the generalizability of motion estimation tasks across diverse LiDAR datasets and proposed UniFlow, a unified model trained on multiple large-scale datasets with varied sensor configurations.

Result: UniFlow surpassed previous state-of-the-art results on Waymo and nuScenes datasets by 5.1% and 35.2%, respectively, and outperformed prior models on unseen TruckScenes data by 30.1%.

Conclusion: Cross-dataset training significantly benefits 3D motion estimation tasks in LiDAR scene flow, and the proposed UniFlow model provides superior accuracy across various datasets, demonstrating robust generalizability.

Abstract: LiDAR scene flow is the task of estimating per-point 3D motion between consecutive point clouds. Recent methods achieve centimeter-level accuracy on popular autonomous vehicle (AV) datasets, but are typically only trained and evaluated on a single sensor. In this paper, we aim to learn general motion priors that transfer to diverse and unseen LiDAR sensors. However, prior work in LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection demonstrate that naively training on multiple datasets yields worse performance than single dataset models. Interestingly, we find that this conventional wisdom does not hold for motion estimation, and that state-of-the-art scene flow methods greatly benefit from cross-dataset training. We posit that low-level tasks such as motion estimation may be less sensitive to sensor configuration; indeed, our analysis shows that models trained on fast-moving objects (e.g., from highway datasets) perform well on fast-moving objects, even across different datasets. Informed by our analysis, we propose UniFlow, a family of feedforward models that unifies and trains on multiple large-scale LiDAR scene flow datasets with diverse sensor placements and point cloud densities. Our frustratingly simple solution establishes a new state-of-the-art on Waymo and nuScenes, improving over prior work by 5.1% and 35.2% respectively. Moreover, UniFlow achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on unseen datasets like TruckScenes, outperforming prior TruckScenes-specific models by 30.1%.

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Sequence Adaptive Video Prediction with Diffusion Noise Optimization (SAVi-DNO)", a method for continuously adapting diffusion-based video prediction models to forecast future frames in continuous video streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance diffusion-based video prediction models for adapting to continuous video streams and improving their predictive performance by leveraging newly observed data.

Method: The proposed method, SAVi-DNO, adjusts the diffusion noise during model inference instead of fine-tuning the model parameters, making it computationally efficient and adaptive to new video data.

Result: SAVi-DNO demonstrated improved performance on long videos from datasets like Ego4D, OpenDV-YouTube, UCF-101, and SkyTimelapse, validated through metrics such as FVD, SSIM, and PSNR.

Conclusion: The work shows that refining diffusion noise during inference enables continuous adaptation of video prediction models, effectively improving their performance on long, continuous video streams.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate diffusion-based video prediction models, which forecast future video frames, for continuous video streams. In this context, the models observe continuously new training samples, and we aim to leverage this to improve their predictions. We thus propose an approach that continuously adapts a pre-trained diffusion model to a video stream. Since fine-tuning the parameters of a large diffusion model is too expensive, we refine the diffusion noise during inference while keeping the model parameters frozen, allowing the model to adaptively determine suitable sampling noise. We term the approach Sequence Adaptive Video Prediction with Diffusion Noise Optimization (SAVi-DNO). To validate our approach, we introduce a new evaluation setting on the Ego4D dataset, focusing on simultaneous adaptation and evaluation on long continuous videos. Empirical results demonstrate improved performance based on FVD, SSIM, and PSNR metrics on long videos of Ego4D and OpenDV-YouTube, as well as videos of UCF-101 and SkyTimelapse, showcasing SAVi-DNO's effectiveness.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mammoth2, a unified framework combining autoregressive semantic planning and diffusion-based image synthesis for multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between discrete semantic reasoning and high-fidelity image generation within a unified multimodal model.

Method: Mammoth2 incorporates an autoregressive path for semantic modeling, a single-stream Diffusion Transformer decoder for image synthesis, and a feature alignment module. It is trained sequentially using joint Next-Token Prediction and Flow Matching, followed by fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Mammoth2 achieves strong performance on text-to-image synthesis and instruction-based editing benchmarks and competes effectively in multimodal understanding tasks.

Conclusion: A unified AR-Diffusion architecture can balance high-fidelity generation and editing with robust multimodal comprehension in an efficient manner.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to integrate understanding and generation within a single framework, yet bridging the gap between discrete semantic reasoning and high-fidelity visual synthesis remains challenging. We present MammothModa2 (Mammoth2), a unified autoregressive-diffusion (AR-Diffusion) framework designed to effectively couple autoregressive semantic planning with diffusion-based generation. Mammoth2 adopts a serial design: an AR path equipped with generation experts performs global semantic modeling over discrete tokens, while a single-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder handles high-fidelity image synthesis. A carefully designed AR-Diffusion feature alignment module combines multi-layer feature aggregation, unified condition encoding, and in-context conditioning to stably align AR's representations with the diffusion decoder's continuous latents. Mammoth2 is trained end-to-end with joint Next-Token Prediction and Flow Matching objectives, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning over both generation and editing. With roughly 60M supervised generation samples and no reliance on pre-trained generators, Mammoth2 delivers strong text-to-image and instruction-based editing performance on public benchmarks, achieving 0.87 on GenEval, 87.2 on DPGBench, and 4.06 on ImgEdit, while remaining competitive with understanding-only backbones (e.g., Qwen3-VL-8B) on multimodal understanding tasks. These results suggest that a carefully coupled AR-Diffusion architecture can provide high-fidelity generation and editing while maintaining strong multimodal comprehension within a single, parameter- and data-efficient model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current satellite video tracking methods often lack generalization, require scenario-specific training, and struggle with occlusion handling.

Method: SatSAM2 employs a Kalman Filter-based Constrained Motion Module for drift suppression and a Motion-Constrained State Machine for dynamic state regulation. A new benchmark, MVOT, is introduced for evaluation with 1,500+ sequences and diverse conditions.

Result: SatSAM2 outperformed competing trackers on existing benchmarks, achieving a 5.84% AUC improvement over the state-of-the-art on the OOTB dataset.

Conclusion: SatSAM2 demonstrates robust satellite video tracking performance and sets a new standard by addressing key challenges in generalization and tracking reliability. Its code and dataset are being released for future advances.

Abstract: Existing satellite video tracking methods often struggle with generalization, requiring scenario-specific training to achieve satisfactory performance, and are prone to track loss in the presence of occlusion. To address these challenges, we propose SatSAM2, a zero-shot satellite video tracker built on SAM2, designed to adapt foundation models to the remote sensing domain. SatSAM2 introduces two core modules: a Kalman Filter-based Constrained Motion Module (KFCMM) to exploit temporal motion cues and suppress drift, and a Motion-Constrained State Machine (MCSM) to regulate tracking states based on motion dynamics and reliability. To support large-scale evaluation, we propose MatrixCity Video Object Tracking (MVOT), a synthetic benchmark containing 1,500+ sequences and 157K annotated frames with diverse viewpoints, illumination, and occlusion conditions. Extensive experiments on two satellite tracking benchmarks and MVOT show that SatSAM2 outperforms both traditional and foundation model-based trackers, including SAM2 and its variants. Notably, on the OOTB dataset, SatSAM2 achieves a 5.84% AUC improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Our code and dataset will be publicly released to encourage further research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PicWorld, a benchmark designed to evaluate text-to-image models on implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with implicit world knowledge, physical realism, and logical consistency in generated images.

Method: The authors design the PicWorld benchmark with 1,100 prompts and propose PW-Agent, a multi-agent evaluator that assesses realism and consistency by breaking down prompts into visual evidence.

Result: Analysis of 17 mainstream T2I models shows limitations in handling implicit knowledge and reasoning tasks, emphasizing critical gaps.

Conclusion: Future text-to-image systems need architectures that integrate reasoning and knowledge for improved performance in these areas.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models today are capable of producing photorealistic, instruction-following images, yet they still frequently fail on prompts that require implicit world knowledge. Existing evaluation protocols either emphasize compositional alignment or rely on single-round VQA-based scoring, leaving critical dimensions such as knowledge grounding, multi-physics interactions, and auditable evidence-substantially undertested. To address these limitations, we introduce PicWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark that assesses the grasp of implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning of T2I models. This benchmark consists of 1,100 prompts across three core categories. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we propose PW-Agent, an evidence-grounded multi-agent evaluator to hierarchically assess images on their physical realism and logical consistency by decomposing prompts into verifiable visual evidence. We conduct a thorough analysis of 17 mainstream T2I models on PicWorld, illustrating that they universally exhibit a fundamental limitation in their capacity for implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning to varying degrees. The findings highlight the need for reasoning-aware, knowledge-integrative architectures in future T2I systems.

### [261] [Vision Token Masking Alone Cannot Prevent PHI Leakage in Medical Document OCR: A Systematic Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18272)
*Richard J. Young*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates inference-time vision token masking using DeepSeek-OCR for protecting patient data during medical OCR, identifying limitations and suggesting hybrid solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address privacy concerns and PHI exposure when large vision-language models are deployed for OCR in healthcare settings.

Method: Seven vision token masking strategies targeting different architectural layers were tested on synthetic medical billing statements, with ablation studies on spatial masking and a simulation of a hybrid model combining vision masking with NLP post-processing.

Result: All masking strategies reduced certain PHI categories (names, addresses) completely but failed to prevent leakage of structured identifiers like social security numbers. The hybrid model simulation achieved an improved 88.6% PHI reduction.

Conclusion: Vision-only masking has inherent limitations in preventing structured data leakage due to language model contextual inference. Future work should focus on hybrid architectures and decoder-level tuning for compliant data handling.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed for optical character recognition (OCR) in healthcare settings, raising critical concerns about protected health information (PHI) exposure during document processing. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of inference-time vision token masking as a privacy-preserving mechanism for medical document OCR using DeepSeek-OCR. We introduce seven masking strategies (V3-V9) targeting different architectural layers (SAM encoder blocks, compression layers, dual vision encoders, projector fusion) and evaluate PHI reduction across HIPAA-defined categories using 100 synthetic medical billing statements (drawn from a corpus of 38,517 annotated documents) with perfect ground-truth annotations. All masking strategies converge to 42.9% PHI reduction, successfully suppressing long-form spatially-distributed identifiers (patient names, dates of birth, physical addresses at 100% effectiveness) while failing to prevent short structured identifiers (medical record numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, account numbers at 0% effectiveness). Ablation studies varying mask expansion radius (r=1,2,3) demonstrate that increased spatial coverage does not improve reduction beyond this ceiling, indicating that language model contextual inference - not insufficient visual masking - drives structured identifier leakage. A simulated hybrid architecture combining vision masking with NLP post-processing achieves 88.6% total PHI reduction (assuming 80% NLP accuracy on remaining identifiers). This negative result establishes boundaries for vision-only privacy interventions in VLMs, provides guidance distinguishing PHI types amenable to vision-level versus language-level redaction, and redirects future research toward decoder-level fine-tuning and hybrid defense-in-depth architectures for HIPAA-compliant medical document processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods struggle to maintain motion fidelity while making accurate subject edits due to reliance on suboptimal motion representations.

Method: The authors propose 'anchor tokens,' meaningful motion points derived from a video diffusion model, which encode video dynamics compactly and enable flexible adaptation to new subjects.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that 'anchor tokens' improve controllability and semantic alignment in video editing, achieving better balance between motion and edit fidelity compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The 'Point-to-Point' method utilizing anchor tokens provides a robust solution for diverse video editing scenarios, delivering superior results in terms of motion and editing quality.

Abstract: Accurately preserving motion while editing a subject remains a core challenge in video editing tasks. Existing methods often face a trade-off between edit and motion fidelity, as they rely on motion representations that are either overfitted to the layout or only implicitly defined. To overcome this limitation, we revisit point-based motion representation. However, identifying meaningful points remains challenging without human input, especially across diverse video scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel motion representation, anchor tokens, that capture the most essential motion patterns by leveraging the rich prior of a video diffusion model. Anchor tokens encode video dynamics compactly through a small number of informative point trajectories and can be flexibly relocated to align with new subjects. This allows our method, Point-to-Point, to generalize across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that anchor tokens lead to more controllable and semantically aligned video edits, achieving superior performance in terms of edit and motion fidelity.

### [263] [Uni-DAD: Unified Distillation and Adaptation of Diffusion Models for Few-step Few-shot Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18281)
*Yara Bahram,Melodie Desbos,Mohammadhadi Shateri,Eric Granger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Uni-DAD, a unified single-stage pipeline for faster and high-quality diffusion model adaptation and distillation, addressing issues of complexity and degraded results in traditional two-stage pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the training process for diffusion models and improve quality and diversity during domain adaptation and distillation, addressing limitations of existing two-stage pipelines.

Method: Uni-DAD uses a dual-domain distillation objective and a multi-head GAN loss to jointly perform distillation and adaption. It combines signals from source and target teachers for domain transfer and stabilizes training using multi-head GAN for diverse and realistic adaptations.

Result: Uni-DAD achieves better quality and diversity compared to state-of-the-art adaptation methods in fewer sampling steps, outperforming two-stage pipelines for few-shot image generation and subject personalization tasks.

Conclusion: The single-stage Uni-DAD pipeline is a more efficient and effective approach for adapting and distilling diffusion models to novel domains, overcoming challenges of existing methods in terms of quality, diversity, and simplicity.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) produce high-quality images, yet their sampling remains costly when adapted to new domains. Distilled DMs are faster but typically remain confined within their teacher's domain. Thus, fast and high-quality generation for novel domains relies on two-stage training pipelines: Adapt-then-Distill or Distill-then-Adapt. However, both add design complexity and suffer from degraded quality or diversity. We introduce Uni-DAD, a single-stage pipeline that unifies distillation and adaptation of DMs. It couples two signals during training: (i) a dual-domain distribution-matching distillation objective that guides the student toward the distributions of the source teacher and a target teacher, and (ii) a multi-head generative adversarial network (GAN) loss that encourages target realism across multiple feature scales. The source domain distillation preserves diverse source knowledge, while the multi-head GAN stabilizes training and reduces overfitting, especially in few-shot regimes. The inclusion of a target teacher facilitates adaptation to more structurally distant domains. We perform evaluations on a variety of datasets for few-shot image generation (FSIG) and subject-driven personalization (SDP). Uni-DAD delivers higher quality than state-of-the-art (SoTA) adaptation methods even with less than 4 sampling steps, and outperforms two-stage training pipelines in both quality and diversity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoadSceneVQA, a dataset for visual question answering in traffic scenarios, along with methods to enhance model reasoning and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of contextual reasoning and natural language interaction in current roadside perception systems.

Method: Developed the RoadSceneVQA dataset, introduced CogniAnchor Fusion (CAF) and Assisted Decoupled Chain-of-Thought (AD-CoT) modules, and proposed the RoadMind model.

Result: RoadMind shows improved reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art results on RoadSceneVQA and CODA-LM benchmarks.

Conclusion: This research enhances Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for structured traffic reasoning and perception.

Abstract: Current roadside perception systems mainly focus on instance-level perception, which fall short in enabling interaction via natural language and reasoning about traffic behaviors in context. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoadSceneVQA, a large-scale and richly annotated visual question answering (VQA) dataset specifically tailored for roadside scenarios. The dataset comprises 34,736 diverse QA pairs collected under varying weather, illumination, and traffic conditions, targeting not only object attributes but also the intent, legality, and interaction patterns of traffic participants. RoadSceneVQA challenges models to perform both explicit recognition and implicit commonsense reasoning, grounded in real-world traffic rules and contextual dependencies. To fully exploit the reasoning potential of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we further propose CogniAnchor Fusion (CAF), a vision-language fusion module inspired by human-like scene anchoring mechanisms. Moreover, we propose the Assisted Decoupled Chain-of-Thought (AD-CoT) to enhance the reasoned thinking via CoT prompting and multi-task learning. Based on the above, we propose the baseline model RoadMind. Experiments on RoadSceneVQA and CODA-LM benchmark show that the pipeline consistently improves both reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing the MLLM to achieve state-of-the-art performance in structural traffic perception and reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwiftVGGT offers a training-free strategy for dense 3D reconstruction in large-scale environments, achieving high accuracy while significantly reducing computational time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accuracy versus computational efficiency in 3D reconstruction for large-scale scenes is challenging, as existing methods often prioritize one at the expense of the other.

Method: SwiftVGGT introduces a training-free approach with innovations like loop closure without external VPR models and a novel point sampling method using single SVD for alignment, avoiding complex optimizations.

Result: SwiftVGGT attains state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and reduces inference time by 67%, compared to VGGT-based approaches.

Conclusion: The method addresses accuracy-speed trade-offs effectively, enabling faster, consistent, high-quality 3D reconstructions in kilometer-scale environments.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction in large-scale scenes is a fundamental task in 3D perception, but the inherent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. Existing methods either prioritize speed and produce low-quality results, or achieve high-quality reconstruction at the cost of slow inference times. In this paper, we propose SwiftVGGT, a training-free method that significantly reduce inference time while preserving high-quality dense 3D reconstruction. To maintain global consistency in large-scale scenes, SwiftVGGT performs loop closure without relying on the external Visual Place Recognition (VPR) model. This removes redundant computation and enables accurate reconstruction over kilometer-scale environments. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective point sampling method to align neighboring chunks using a single Sim(3)-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) step. This eliminates the need for the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimization commonly used in prior work, leading to substantial speed-ups. We evaluate SwiftVGGT on multiple datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while requiring only 33% of the inference time of recent VGGT-based large-scale reconstruction approaches.

*Raja Kumar,Arka Sadhu,Ram Nevatia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiVE-k, a reinforcement learning framework for fine-grained visual reasoning in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) using top-k predictions as training signals, showing significant improvements in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with fine-grained image recognition and generalization, partly due to limitations in existing reinforcement learning methods that encourage memorization and fail in differential reasoning.

Method: DiVE-k forms multiple-choice questions using the model's top-k predictions and trains it through reinforcement learning to choose the correct answer, prompting fine-grained differential reasoning among plausible options.

Result: Experiments on five datasets reveal that DiVE-k outperforms existing approaches, showing a 10.04% and 6.16% improvement in Harmonic Mean over QWEN2.5-VL-7B and ViRFT, respectively, along with gains in mixed-domain and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: DiVE-k effectively mitigates memorization issues, enhances fine-grained differential reasoning, and boosts generalization performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) possess extensive text knowledge but struggles to utilize this knowledge for fine-grained image recognition, often failing to differentiate between visually similar categories. Existing fine-tuning methods using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with exact-match reward signals are often brittle, encourage memorization of training categories, and fail to elicit differential reasoning needed for generalization to unseen classes. To address this, we propose $\textbf{DiVE-k}$, $\textbf{Di}$fferential $\textbf{V}$isual r$\textbf{E}$asoning using top-$\textbf{k}$ generations, framework that leverages model's own top-k predictions as a training signal. For each training image, DiVE-k creates a multiple-choice question from the model's top-k outputs and uses RL to train the model to select the correct answer. This approach requires the model to perform fine-grained differential reasoning among plausible options and provides a simple, verifiable reward signal that mitigates memorization and improves generalization. Experiments on five standard fine-grained datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. In the standard base-to-novel generalization setting, DiVE-k surpasses the QWEN2.5-VL-7B and ViRFT by 10.04% and 6.16% on the Harmonic Mean metric, respectively. Further experiments show similar gains in mixed-domain and few-shot scenarios.

### [267] [ScriptViT: Vision Transformer-Based Personalized Handwriting Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18307)
*Sajjan Acharya,Rajendra Baskota*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in generating realistic and writer-specific styled handwritten text by introducing a Vision Transformer-based style encoder and a cross-attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle to capture nuanced global stylistic attributes like slant, curvature, or stroke pressure in handwriting synthesis.

Method: A Vision Transformer-based style encoder is utilized to learn global stylistic patterns, combined with cross-attention for integrating style cues with target text.

Result: Improved stylized handwriting synthesis capturing more nuanced writer-specific traits and utilizing Salient Stroke Attention Analysis for interpretability.

Conclusion: This unified framework enhances the realism, writer-specific coherence, and interpretability of generated handwritten text.

Abstract: Styled handwriting generation aims to synthesize handwritten text that looks both realistic and aligned with a specific writer's style. While recent approaches involving GAN, transformer and diffusion-based models have made progress, they often struggle to capture the full spectrum of writer-specific attributes, particularly global stylistic patterns that span long-range spatial dependencies. As a result, capturing subtle writer-specific traits such as consistent slant, curvature or stroke pressure, while keeping the generated text accurate is still an open problem. In this work, we present a unified framework designed to address these limitations. We introduce a Vision Transformer-based style encoder that learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, allowing the model to better represent long-range structural characteristics of handwriting. We then integrate these style cues with the target text using a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the system to produce handwritten images that more faithfully reflect the intended style. To make the process more interpretable, we utilize Salient Stroke Attention Analysis (SSAA), which reveals the stroke-level features the model focuses on during style transfer. Together, these components lead to handwriting synthesis that is not only more stylistically coherent, but also easier to understand and analyze.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early recognition of strokes is crucial to reduce mortality and disability worldwide, but manual CT scan analysis is prone to delays and errors.

Method: A transfer learning framework using Vision Transformer (ViT) with frozen and fine-tuned encoder blocks is combined with a Bi-GRU model for classification. Data augmentation addresses class imbalance.

Result: The model successfully classified brain strokes with an accuracy of 94.06% using the Stroke Dataset.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for efficient stroke identification, enhancing diagnostic speed and reliability through a deep learning approach.

Abstract: Stroke majorly causes death and disability worldwide, and early recognition is one of the key elements of successful treatment of the same. It is common to diagnose strokes using CT scanning, which is fast and readily available, however, manual analysis may take time and may result in mistakes. In this work, a pre-trained Vision Transformer-based transfer learning framework is proposed for the early identification of brain stroke. A few of the encoder blocks of the ViT model are frozen, and the rest are allowed to be fine-tuned in order to learn brain stroke-specific features. The features that have been extracted are given as input to a single-layer Bi-GRU to perform classification. Class imbalance is handled by data augmentation. The model has achieved 94.06% accuracy in classifying brain stroke from the Stroke Dataset.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interactive stereo calibration framework for 3D deformation measurement, improving accuracy and efficiency through optimal pose guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stereo calibration methods for 3D deformation measurement are inefficient and lack optimal pose guidance, resulting in suboptimal accuracy.

Method: The authors propose a pose optimization method employing joint optimization of extrinsic parameters and loss minimization using the covariance matrix trace. The method incorporates a user-friendly graphical interface for easy calibration image capture.

Result: The method reduces required images, improves accuracy, and remains robust across varying fields of view. Validation with thermal deformation tests showed agreement with finite element analysis simulations.

Conclusion: The interactive calibration framework significantly enhances stereo calibration and has strong potential application in 3D deformation measurement field.

Abstract: Stereo optical measurement techniques, such as digital image correlation (DIC), are widely used in 3D deformation measurement as non-contact, full-field measurement methods, in which stereo calibration is a crucial step. However, current stereo calibration methods lack intuitive optimal pose guidance, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal accuracy in deformation measurements. The aim of this study is to develop an interactive calibration framework that automatically generates the next optimal pose, enabling high-accuracy stereo calibration for 3D deformation measurement. We propose a pose optimization method that introduces joint optimization of relative and absolute extrinsic parameters, with the minimization of the covariance matrix trace adopted as the loss function to solve for the next optimal pose. Integrated with this method is a user-friendly graphical interface, which guides even non-expert users to capture qualified calibration images. Our proposed method demonstrates superior efficiency (requiring fewer images) and accuracy (demonstrating lower measurement errors) compared to random pose, while maintaining robustness across varying FOVs. In the thermal deformation measurement tests on an S-shaped specimen, the results exhibit high agreement with finite element analysis (FEA) simulations in both deformation magnitude and evolutionary trends. We present a pose guidance method for high-precision stereo calibration in 3D deformation measurement. The simulation experiments, real-world experiments, and thermal deformation measurement applications all demonstrate the significant application potential of our proposed method in the field of 3D deformation measurement.

*Helia Abedini,Saba Rahimi,Reza Vaziri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study compares three pretrained CNN architectures for brain tumor detection using MRI scans on a small dataset and finds general-purpose CNNs outperform domain-specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear performance of different pretrained models (general-purpose versus domain-specific) for brain tumor classification in cases of limited data.

Method: Three CNN architectures (RadImageNet DenseNet121, EfficientNetV2S, ConvNeXt-Tiny) were assessed, trained, and fine-tuned under identical conditions using a small brain MRI dataset.

Result: ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest classification accuracy, EfficientNetV2S followed, and RadImageNet DenseNet121 showed poor generalization with weaker results.

Conclusion: General-purpose CNNs pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit better transfer learning performance than domain-specific models for medical tasks under limited data conditions.

Abstract: Brain tumor detection from MRI scans plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, particularly when pretrained on large datasets. However, it remains unclear which type of pretrained model performs better when only a small dataset is available: those trained on domain-specific medical data or those pretrained on large general datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluate three pretrained CNN architectures for brain tumor classification: RadImageNet DenseNet121 with medical-domain pretraining, EfficientNetV2S, and ConvNeXt-Tiny, which are modern general-purpose CNNs. All models were trained and fine-tuned under identical conditions using a limited-size brain MRI dataset to ensure a fair comparison. Our results reveal that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest accuracy, followed by EfficientNetV2S, while RadImageNet DenseNet121, despite being pretrained on domain-specific medical data, exhibited poor generalization with lower accuracy and higher loss. These findings suggest that domain-specific pretraining may not generalize well under small-data conditions. In contrast, modern, deeper general-purpose CNNs pretrained on large-scale datasets can offer superior transfer learning performance in specialized medical imaging tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SciPostLayoutTree, a dataset of 8,000 academic posters labeled for structure analysis, and proposes a model, Layout Tree Decoder, to improve visual structure prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in the structural analysis of academic posters, which are vital for communication but underexplored compared to papers.

Method: Developed a dataset (SciPostLayoutTree) annotated with reading order and parent-child relations, and a Layout Tree Decoder model that integrates visual and bounding box features with beam search to enhance prediction accuracy.

Result: The Layout Tree Decoder model outperforms others in handling spatially challenging relations in poster structures and sets a new baseline. The dataset and code are publicly released.

Conclusion: The research advances structure-aware analysis of academic posters, aiding better interface building and research comprehension.

Abstract: Scientific posters play a vital role in academic communication by presenting ideas through visual summaries. Analyzing reading order and parent-child relations of posters is essential for building structure-aware interfaces that facilitate clear and accurate understanding of research content. Despite their prevalence in academic communication, posters remain underexplored in structural analysis research, which has primarily focused on papers. To address this gap, we constructed SciPostLayoutTree, a dataset of approximately 8,000 posters annotated with reading order and parent-child relations. Compared to an existing structural analysis dataset, SciPostLayoutTree contains more instances of spatially challenging relations, including upward, horizontal, and long-distance relations. As a solution to these challenges, we develop Layout Tree Decoder, which incorporates visual features as well as bounding box features including position and category information. The model also uses beam search to predict relations while capturing sequence-level plausibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our model improves the prediction accuracy for spatially challenging relations and establishes a solid baseline for poster structure analysis. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/omron-sinicx/scipostlayouttree. The code is also publicly available at https://github.com/omron-sinicx/scipostlayouttree.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ConsistCompose, a multimodal framework enabling layout-controlled image generation using language prompts, and constructs a large dataset (ConsistCompose3M) for this purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models focus predominantly on aligning language with image regions, neglecting precise layout-controlled multi-instance generation, which limits compositional control.

Method: ConsistCompose embeds layout coordinates into language prompts for layout-controllable image generation, supported by a newly created dataset (ConsistCompose3M) with layout and identity annotations.

Result: ConsistCompose achieves significant improvements in spatial accuracy while maintaining identity fidelity, outperforming layout-controlled baselines in multimodal image generation tasks.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a unified framework for layout-controllable multimodal image generation, pushing forward spatial accuracy and identity fidelity without needing task-specific branches.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models that couple visual understanding with image generation have advanced rapidly, yet most systems still focus on visual grounding-aligning language with image regions-while their generative counterpart, linguistic-embedded layout-grounded generation (LELG) for layout-controllable multi-instance generation, remains underexplored and limits precise compositional control. We present ConsistCompose, a unified multimodal framework that embeds layout coordinates directly into language prompts, enabling layout-controlled multi-instance image generation from Interleaved Image-Text within a single generative interface. We further construct ConsistCompose3M, a 3.4M multi-instance generation dataset with layout and identity annotations (2.6M text-guided and 0.8M image-guided data pairs) that provides large-scale supervision for layout-conditioned generation. Within this framework, LELG is instantiated through instance-coordinate binding prompts and coordinate-aware classifier-free guidance, which translate linguistic layout cues into precise spatial control without task-specific branches. Experiments on COCO-Position and MS-Bench show that ConsistCompose substantially improves spatial accuracy over layout-controlled baselines while preserving identity fidelity and competitive general multimodal understanding, establishing a unified paradigm for layout-controllable multimodal image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual multi-object tracking of UAVs faces challenges in complex conditions; existing solutions are hindered by lack of suitable multi-modal datasets.

Method: The paper presents the MM-UAV dataset with 1,321 sequences and proposes a tracking framework using adaptive alignment, fusion modules, and event-enhanced association mechanisms.

Result: Experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art tracking methods.

Conclusion: The MM-UAV dataset and framework advance the robustness of UAV tracking, promoting future multi-modal research in the field.

Abstract: With the proliferation of low altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), visual multi-object tracking is becoming a critical security technology, demanding significant robustness even in complex environmental conditions. However, tracking UAVs using a single visual modality often fails in challenging scenarios, such as low illumination, cluttered backgrounds, and rapid motion. Although multi-modal multi-object UAV tracking is more resilient, the development of effective solutions has been hindered by the absence of dedicated public datasets. To bridge this gap, we release MM-UAV, the first large-scale benchmark for Multi-Modal UAV Tracking, integrating three key sensing modalities, e.g. RGB, infrared (IR), and event signals. The dataset spans over 30 challenging scenarios, with 1,321 synchronised multi-modal sequences, and more than 2.8 million annotated frames. Accompanying the dataset, we provide a novel multi-modal multi-UAV tracking framework, designed specifically for UAV tracking applications and serving as a baseline for future research. Our framework incorporates two key technical innovations, e.g. an offset-guided adaptive alignment module to resolve spatio mismatches across sensors, and an adaptive dynamic fusion module to balance complementary information conveyed by different modalities. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of conventional appearance modelling in multi-object tracking, we introduce an event-enhanced association mechanism that leverages motion cues from the event modality for more reliable identity maintenance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. To foster further research in multi-modal UAV tracking, both the dataset and source code will be made publicly available at https://xuefeng-zhu5.github.io/MM-UAV/.

Motivation: The current methods for video relighting with background replacement face challenges in achieving a balance between temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and natural illumination.

Method: FlowPortal employs a Residual-Corrected Flow mechanism for better structural consistency, a Decoupled Condition Design for lighting control precision, and a High-Frequency Transfer mechanism for preserving details. A masking strategy enables isolated foreground and background processing.

Result: FlowPortal demonstrates superior performance in temporal coherence, structural preservation, and lighting realism compared to existing methods, all while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: FlowPortal provides an innovative approach to video relighting with background replacement by addressing key limitations in existing methods, offering high-quality results and practical efficiency.

Abstract: Video relighting with background replacement is a challenging task critical for applications in film production and creative media. Existing methods struggle to balance temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and illumination naturalness. To address these issues, we introduce FlowPortal, a novel training-free flow-based video relighting framework. Our core innovation is a Residual-Corrected Flow mechanism that transforms a standard flow-based model into an editing model, guaranteeing perfect reconstruction when input conditions are identical and enabling faithful relighting when they differ, resulting in high structural consistency. This is further enhanced by a Decoupled Condition Design for precise lighting control and a High-Frequency Transfer mechanism for detail preservation. Additionally, a masking strategy isolates foreground relighting from background pure generation process. Experiments demonstrate that FlowPortal achieves superior performance in temporal coherence, structural preservation, and lighting realism, while maintaining high efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users face difficulty generating AIGC content aligned with their preferences due to the challenge of crafting precise prompts and the lack of mechanisms to retain preferences.

Method: The authors created UniPrefer-100K, a dataset of user-preferred styles, and developed MagicWand, an agent that improves prompt generation and evaluation. Additionally, UniPreferBench, a benchmark for preference-alignment assessment, was introduced.

Result: Experiments using UniPreferBench showed that MagicWand performs consistently well in generating and evaluating content in alignment with user preferences across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset, agent, and benchmark provide a comprehensive solution for advancing user-preferred content generation in AIGC models.

Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) models have enabled significant progress in image and video generation. However, users still struggle to obtain content that aligns with their preferences due to the difficulty of crafting detailed prompts and the lack of mechanisms to retain their preferences. To address these challenges, we construct \textbf{UniPrefer-100K}, a large-scale dataset comprising images, videos, and associated text that describes the styles users tend to prefer. Based on UniPrefer-100K, we propose \textbf{MagicWand}, a universal generation and evaluation agent that enhances prompts based on user preferences, leverages advanced generation models for high-quality content, and applies preference-aligned evaluation and refinement. In addition, we introduce \textbf{UniPreferBench}, the first large-scale benchmark with over 120K annotations for assessing user preference alignment across diverse AIGC tasks. Experiments on UniPreferBench demonstrate that MagicWand consistently generates content and evaluations that are well aligned with user preferences across a wide range of scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding and controlling how video understanding models (VLMs) acquire answers and make predictions.

Method: The paper introduces a logits-to-video (L2V) task and TRANSPORTER, leveraging text-to-video (T2V) generative models and optimal transport couplings with VLM embedding spaces for conditional video generation.

Result: TRANSPORTER generates high-fidelity videos that visualizes diverse object attributes, action adverbs, and scene contexts based on VLM predictions. Evaluations show enhanced interpretability and novel insights.

Conclusion: The proposed L2V task and TRANSPORTER method provide a promising pathway for interpretability in VLMs by visually capturing underlying predictive rules, contributing to a novel understanding of model behavior.

Abstract: How do video understanding models acquire their answers? Although current Vision Language Models (VLMs) reason over complex scenes with diverse objects, action performances, and scene dynamics, understanding and controlling their internal processes remains an open challenge. Motivated by recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generative models, this paper introduces a logits-to-video (L2V) task alongside a model-independent approach, TRANSPORTER, to generate videos that capture the underlying rules behind VLMs' predictions. Given the high-visual-fidelity produced by T2V models, TRANSPORTER learns an optimal transport coupling to VLM's high-semantic embedding spaces. In turn, logit scores define embedding directions for conditional video generation. TRANSPORTER generates videos that reflect caption changes over diverse object attributes, action adverbs, and scene context. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across VLMs demonstrate that L2V can provide a fidelity-rich, novel direction for model interpretability that has not been previously explored.

Method: The authors derive a maximum sampling frequency formulation for 4D Gaussian Splatting and propose a 4D scale-adaptive filter and scale loss to adjust rendering frequencies.

Result: The method eliminates high-frequency artifacts in higher rendering frequencies and reduces redundant Gaussians in multi-view video reconstruction.

Conclusion: The approach proves effective in enhancing rendering quality and efficiency in both monocular and multi-view video reconstruction experiments.

Abstract: Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based on Gaussian Splatting enable real-time rendering and generate realistic images. However, adjusting the camera's focal length or the distance between Gaussian primitives and the camera to modify rendering resolution often introduces strong artifacts, stemming from the frequency constraints of 4D Gaussians and Gaussian scale mismatch induced by the 2D dilated filter. To address this, we derive a maximum sampling frequency formulation for 4D Gaussian Splatting and introduce a 4D scale-adaptive filter and scale loss, which flexibly regulates the sampling frequency of 4D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach eliminates high-frequency artifacts under increased rendering frequencies while effectively reducing redundant Gaussians in multi-view video reconstruction. We validate the proposed method through monocular and multi-view video reconstruction experiments.Ours project page: https://4d-alias-free.github.io/4D-Alias-free/

### [278] [MimiCAT: Mimic with Correspondence-Aware Cascade-Transformer for Category-Free 3D Pose Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18370)
*Zenghao Chai,Chen Tang,Yongkang Wong,Xulei Yang,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MimiCAT, a model for category-free 3D pose transfer using a new million-scale pose dataset and a cascade-transformer approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D pose transfer methods are restricted to similar-structure characters, lacking ability to handle transfer across diverse structures, such as between humanoids and quadrupeds.

Method: The paper constructs a large-scale pose dataset and proposes MimiCAT, which learns soft correspondences using semantic keypoints and conducts pose transfer with a cascade-transformer model.

Result: MimiCAT achieves superior and more generalized pose transfer across character types, outperforming prior methods in experiments.

Conclusion: MimiCAT effectively addresses pose transfer challenges in category-free settings, expanding the capabilities of 3D pose transfer across structurally diverse characters.

Abstract: 3D pose transfer aims to transfer the pose-style of a source mesh to a target character while preserving both the target's geometry and the source's pose characteristic. Existing methods are largely restricted to characters with similar structures and fail to generalize to category-free settings (e.g., transferring a humanoid's pose to a quadruped). The key challenge lies in the structural and transformation diversity inherent in distinct character types, which often leads to mismatched regions and poor transfer quality. To address these issues, we first construct a million-scale pose dataset across hundreds of distinct characters. We further propose MimiCAT, a cascade-transformer model designed for category-free 3D pose transfer. Instead of relying on strict one-to-one correspondence mappings, MimiCAT leverages semantic keypoint labels to learn a novel soft correspondence that enables flexible many-to-many matching across characters. The pose transfer is then formulated as a conditional generation process, in which the source transformations are first projected onto the target through soft correspondence matching and subsequently refined using shape-conditioned representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MimiCAT transfers plausible poses across different characters, significantly outperforming prior methods that are limited to narrow category transfer (e.g., humanoid-to-humanoid).

TL;DR: The paper addresses shortcomings of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in physics-driven reasoning with a new benchmark (MASS-Bench) and a refinement method (MASS), achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in tasks requiring physics-driven reasoning, essential for interpreting and generating videos involving motion dynamics and spatial interactions.

Method: The study introduces MASS-Bench, a benchmark with annotated videos and question pairs, and proposes MASS, a model-agnostic method that enhances VLMs by integrating spatial-temporal signals, 3D depth encoding, and reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: Refined Vision Language Models using the proposed method outperform existing baselines by 8.7% and prior state-of-the-art models by 6%. Results are also comparable to leading closed-source models.

Conclusion: MASS and MASS-Bench successfully advance the reasoning capabilities of VLMs in physics-related tasks, bridging the gap in physics-driven video comprehension and content generation.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on standard video tasks but struggle with physics-driven reasoning involving motion dynamics and spatial interactions. This limitation reduces their ability to interpret real or AI-generated content (AIGC) videos and to generate physically consistent content. We present an approach that addresses this gap by translating physical-world context cues into interpretable representations aligned with VLMs' perception, comprehension, and reasoning. We introduce MASS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 4,350 real-world and AIGC videos and 8,361 free-form video question-answering pairs focused on physics-related comprehension tasks, with detailed annotations including visual detections, sub-segment grounding, and full-sequence 3D motion tracking of entities. We further present MASS, a model-agnostic method that injects spatial-temporal signals into the VLM language space via depth-based 3D encoding and visual grounding, coupled with a motion tracker for object dynamics. To strengthen cross-modal alignment and reasoning, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning. Experiments and ablations show that our refined VLMs outperform comparable and larger baselines, as well as prior state-of-the-art models, by 8.7% and 6.0%, achieving performance comparable to close-source SoTA VLMs such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on physics reasoning and comprehension. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CompGen, a novel framework using curriculum reinforcement learning to improve compositional Text-to-Image generation, significantly enhancing scene composition capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in accurately generating complex multi-object scenes with precise attributes and relationships in T2I systems.

Method: CompGen uses scene graph-based difficulty criteria and adaptive curriculum learning via reinforcement learning to train T2I models.

Result: Experiments show improved compositional generation performance in both diffusion-based and auto-regressive T2I models under specific curriculum strategies.

Conclusion: CompGen’s curriculum learning approach effectively boosts compositional capabilities in T2I generation, advancing the state-of-the-art in this domain.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has long been an open problem, with compositional synthesis remaining particularly challenging. This task requires accurate rendering of complex scenes containing multiple objects that exhibit diverse attributes as well as intricate spatial and semantic relationships, demanding both precise object placement and coherent inter-object interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel compositional curriculum reinforcement learning framework named CompGen that addresses compositional weakness in existing T2I models. Specifically, we leverage scene graphs to establish a novel difficulty criterion for compositional ability and develop a corresponding adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo graph sampling algorithm. This difficulty-aware approach enables the synthesis of training curriculum data that progressively optimize T2I models through reinforcement learning. We integrate our curriculum learning approach into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and investigate different curriculum scheduling strategies. Our experiments reveal that CompGen exhibits distinct scaling curves under different curriculum scheduling strategies, with easy-to-hard and Gaussian sampling strategies yielding superior scaling performance compared to random sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompGen significantly enhances compositional generation capabilities for both diffusion-based and auto-regressive T2I models, highlighting its effectiveness in improving the compositional T2I generation systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper delves into understanding Mamba in vision tasks by analyzing its mechanics, introducing a new activation metric, and showcasing its performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to comprehend Mamba's representational properties and mechanisms in vision tasks, which remain insufficiently explored despite its efficacy.

Method: 1. Theoretically analyzed Mamba's links to Softmax and Linear Attention. 
2. Developed a binary segmentation metric for activation maps. 
3. Applied self-supervised pretraining (DINO) for clearer activation maps and evaluation.

Result: 1. Established Mamba as a low-rank approximation of Softmax Attention.
2. Demonstrated Mamba's effectiveness in modeling long-range dependencies through the novel metric.
3. Achieved 78.5% linear probing accuracy on ImageNet.

Conclusion: Mamba presents strong potential for interpretability and performance in vision tasks, providing a meaningful pathway for future research.

Abstract: Mamba has recently garnered attention as an effective backbone for vision tasks. However, its underlying mechanism in visual domains remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate Mamba's representational properties and make three primary contributions. First, we theoretically analyze Mamba's relationship to Softmax and Linear Attention, confirming that it can be viewed as a low-rank approximation of Softmax Attention and thereby bridging the representational gap between Softmax and Linear forms. Second, we introduce a novel binary segmentation metric for activation map evaluation, extending qualitative assessments to a quantitative measure that demonstrates Mamba's capacity to model long-range dependencies. Third, by leveraging DINO for self-supervised pretraining, we obtain clearer activation maps than those produced by standard supervised approaches, highlighting Mamba's potential for interpretability. Notably, our model also achieves a 78.5 percent linear probing accuracy on ImageNet, underscoring its strong performance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights for future investigations of Mamba-based vision architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ViMix-14M, a 14-million-pair curated video-text dataset addressing the lack of high-quality, publicly available corpora for text-to-video generation. It provides download-ready access with detailed, time-aligned captions, and demonstrates performance improvements in tasks like text-to-video generation and video question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to resolve the shortage of high-quality, openly available, large-scale video-text datasets, which hinders the development of text-to-video generation and other multimodal applications. Existing datasets face issues with accessibility, quality, and licensing challenges.

Method: The authors created ViMix-14M by merging multiple open video sources, applying unified de-duplication and quality filtering, and refining captions through a multi-granularity re-captioning pipeline to ensure alignment with video actions, scenes, and temporal structures.

Result: Using ViMix-14M led to consistent performance improvements in tasks such as multimodal retrieval, text-to-video generation, and video question answering when compared to other video-text datasets.

Conclusion: The ViMix-14M dataset is presented as a valuable tool for training and fine-tuning open-source video foundation models. It seeks to eliminate barriers in this domain and provide a blueprint for constructing superior video-text datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has surged in interest since Sora, yet open-source models still face a data bottleneck: there is no large, high-quality, easily obtainable video-text corpus. Existing public datasets typically require manual YouTube crawling, which yields low usable volume due to link rot and access limits, and raises licensing uncertainty. This work addresses this challenge by introducing ViMix-14M, a curated multi-source video-text dataset of around 14 million pairs that provides crawl-free, download-ready access and long-form, high-quality captions tightly aligned to video. ViMix-14M is built by merging diverse open video sources, followed by unified de-duplication and quality filtering, and a multi-granularity, ground-truth-guided re-captioning pipeline that refines descriptions to better match actions, scenes, and temporal structure. We evaluate the dataset by multimodal retrieval, text-to-video generation, and video question answering tasks, observing consistent improvements over counterpart datasets. We hope this work can help removing the key barrier to training and fine-tuning open-source video foundation models, and provide insights of building high-quality and generalizable video-text datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in X-ray prohibited items detection and explore if secondary views can act as constraints similar to language modality, aiming to enhance security inspection.

Method: The authors developed DualXrayBench, a benchmark supporting eight cross-view tasks, and proposed the Geometric-Semantic Reasoner (GSR), which integrates cross-view and cross-modal correspondences using a new dataset (GSXray) with structured reasoning sequences.

Result: GSR demonstrates significant improvements across all X-ray inspection tasks on the DualXrayBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of using dual-view images as language-like modalities, paving the way for improved real-world X-ray inspection approaches.

Abstract: Automatic X-ray prohibited items detection is vital for security inspection and has been widely studied. Traditional methods rely on visual modality, often struggling with complex threats. While recent studies incorporate language to guide single-view images, human inspectors typically use dual-view images in practice. This raises the question: can the second view provide constraints similar to a language modality? In this work, we introduce DualXrayBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for X-ray inspection that includes multiple views and modalities. It supports eight tasks designed to test cross-view reasoning. In DualXrayBench, we introduce a caption corpus consisting of 45,613 dual-view image pairs across 12 categories with corresponding captions. Building upon these data, we propose the Geometric (cross-view)-Semantic (cross-modality) Reasoner (GSR), a multimodal model that jointly learns correspondences between cross-view geometry and cross-modal semantics, treating the second-view images as a "language-like modality". To enable this, we construct the GSXray dataset, with structured Chain-of-Thought sequences: <top>, <side>, <conclusion>. Comprehensive evaluations on DualXrayBench demonstrate that GSR achieves significant improvements across all X-ray tasks, offering a new perspective for real-world X-ray inspection.

Motivation: To address the need for both rapid 3D scene reconstruction and detailed semantic understanding, which are essential in robotic interaction and augmented reality.

Method: A semantic memory bank leverages multi-view 2D foundation model features to predict attributes for 3D Gaussians, merging reconstruction with semantic data in a single pass.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art geometric fidelity and robust open-set semantic segmentation without per-scene optimization.

Conclusion: SegSplat sets the stage for on-the-fly creation of semantically rich 3D environments, advancing intelligent systems.

Abstract: We have introduced SegSplat, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between rapid, feed-forward 3D reconstruction and rich, open-vocabulary semantic understanding. By constructing a compact semantic memory bank from multi-view 2D foundation model features and predicting discrete semantic indices alongside geometric and appearance attributes for each 3D Gaussian in a single pass, SegSplat efficiently imbues scenes with queryable semantics. Our experiments demonstrate that SegSplat achieves geometric fidelity comparable to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting methods while simultaneously enabling robust open-set semantic segmentation, crucially \textit{without} requiring any per-scene optimization for semantic feature integration. This work represents a significant step towards practical, on-the-fly generation of semantically aware 3D environments, vital for advancing robotic interaction, augmented reality, and other intelligent systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called Class Prototype Learning (CPL) to enhance CLIP-based classification with weak supervision, yielding a 3.67% improvement over strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in aligning large-scale models with user intent as human supervision becomes impractical and inefficient for increasingly complex models.

Method: The paper proposes using weaker models for supervising stronger models in multi-modal contexts, applying weak-to-strong generalization, and implementing Class Prototype Learning (CPL) to improve the classification abilities of CLIP models.

Result: Using CPL with simple loss functions under weak supervision demonstrated robust classification improvements, achieving a 3.67% performance boost over strong baselines in limited pretraining scenarios.

Conclusion: Weak-to-strong generalization and CPL successfully enhance multi-modal classification scenarios, reducing human supervision needs and improving model alignment with user intent.

Abstract: Aligning large-scale commercial models with user intent is crucial to preventing harmful outputs. Current methods rely on human supervision but become impractical as model complexity increases. When models surpass human knowledge, providing accurate feedback becomes challenging and inefficient. A novel solution proposed recently is using a weaker model to supervise a stronger model. This concept leverages the ability of weaker models to perform evaluations, thereby reducing the workload on human supervisors. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language-only models. Extending this concept to vision-language models leverages these insights, adapting the proven benefits to a multi-modal context. In our study, we explore weak-to-strong generalization for CLIP-based classification. We propose a method, class prototype learning (CPL), which aims to enhance the classification capabilities of the CLIP model, by learning more representative prototypes for each category. Our findings indicate that, despite using a simple loss function under weak supervision, CPL yields robust improvements in targeted scenarios, particularly when pretraining is limited. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective under these settings, achieving a 3.67% improvement over strong baseline methods.

*Haonan Wang,Hanyu Zhou,Haoyue Liu,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing 4D-VGGT, a model to estimate dynamic scene geometry using separate spatial and temporal representations, achieving improved discriminability and applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic scene geometry estimation needs effective spatiotemporal representation, but current models face mismatched representations due to aligning heterogeneous spatial and temporal features into a single latent space.

Method: Proposes the generalized model 4D-VGGT: adaptive visual grid allows arbitrary input sequences, separate fusion methods for spatial (cross-view global) and temporal (cross-time local), and multi-task heads enhance estimation across multiple benchmarks.

Result: 4D-VGGT demonstrates superior performance on various dynamic scene geometry tasks using integrated geometry datasets.

Conclusion: The divide-and-conquer representation framework of 4D-VGGT significantly improves dynamic scene geometry representation and application universality.

Abstract: We investigate a challenging task of dynamic scene geometry estimation, which requires representing both spatial and temporal features. Typically, existing methods align the two features into a unified latent space to model scene geometry. However, this unified paradigm suffers from potential mismatched representation due to the heterogeneous nature between spatial and temporal features. In this work, we propose 4D-VGGT, a general foundation model with divide-and-conquer spatiotemporal representation for dynamic scene geometry. Our model is divided into three aspects: 1) Multi-setting input. We design an adaptive visual grid that supports input sequences with arbitrary numbers of views and time steps. 2) Multi-level representation. We propose a cross-view global fusion for spatial representation and a cross-time local fusion for temporal representation. 3) Multi-task prediction. We append multiple task-specific heads to spatiotemporal representations, enabling a comprehensive visual geometry estimation for dynamic scenes. Under this unified framework, these components enhance the feature discriminability and application universality of our model for dynamic scenes. In addition, we integrate multiple geometry datasets to train our model and conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method across various tasks on multiple dynamic scene geometry benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes NeuroVascU-Net, a deep learning model that effectively segments cerebral vasculature in T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI for neurosurgical planning with high accuracy and reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of manual segmentation, inter-observer variability, and the inefficiencies of existing automated methods in accurately segmenting cerebral vasculature for neurosurgical planning.

Method: NeuroVascU-Net uses a unique architecture based on a dilated U-Net integrated with two modules: Multi-Scale Contextual Feature Fusion ($MSC^2F$) to capture local and global information, and Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion ($CDA^2F$) for domain-specific feature integration. It was trained on annotated T1CE MRI data from 137 patients.

Result: NeuroVascU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841, effectively segmenting both major and fine cerebrovascular structures with only 12.4M parameters.

Conclusion: The model provides an accurate and computationally efficient approach for cerebrovascular segmentation in T1CE MRI, enhancing neurosurgical planning and addressing prior limitations of automated methods.

Abstract: Precise 3D segmentation of cerebral vasculature from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1CE) MRI is crucial for safe neurosurgical planning. Manual delineation is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while current automated methods often trade accuracy for computational cost, limiting clinical use. We present NeuroVascU-Net, the first deep learning architecture specifically designed to segment cerebrovascular structures directly from clinically standard T1CE MRI in neuro-oncology patients, addressing a gap in prior work dominated by TOF-MRA-based approaches. NeuroVascU-Net builds on a dilated U-Net and integrates two specialized modules: a Multi-Scale Contextual Feature Fusion ($MSC^2F$) module at the bottleneck and a Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion ($CDA^2F$) module at deeper hierarchical layers. $MSC^2F$ captures both local and global information via multi-scale dilated convolutions, while $CDA^2F$ dynamically integrates domain-specific features, enhancing representation while keeping computation low. The model was trained and validated on a curated dataset of T1CE scans from 137 brain tumor biopsy patients, annotated by a board-certified functional neurosurgeon. NeuroVascU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841, accurately segmenting both major and fine vascular structures. Notably, it requires only 12.4M parameters, significantly fewer than transformer-based models such as Swin U-NetR. This balance of accuracy and efficiency positions NeuroVascU-Net as a practical solution for computer-assisted neurosurgical planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrossJEPA, a memory-efficient and fast-to-train framework utilizing knowledge distillation for image-to-point cross-modal learning in 3D representation, achieving state-of-the-art results with less computational expense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of large, slow-to-train models in 3D representation driven by 2D data, and to explore simpler, efficient architecture designs like JEPA for cross-modal settings.

Method: The proposed CrossJEPA leverages a JEPA-style pretraining strategy that trains a predictor to infer embeddings of 2D views from corresponding 3D point clouds, conditioned on cross-domain projection information, while using foundational image model knowledge and frozen teacher design with embedding caching.

Result: CrossJEPA achieves state-of-the-art results in linear probing benchmarks, including ModelNet40 (94.2%) and ScanObjectNN (88.3%), with significantly fewer parameters (14.1M) and reduced training time (around 6 hours on a standard GPU).

Conclusion: CrossJEPA demonstrates high performance, computational efficiency, and practical feasibility in 3D representation learning, serving as an effective solution for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Image-to-point cross-modal learning has emerged to address the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets in 3D representation learning. However, current methods that leverage 2D data often result in large, slow-to-train models, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy in resource-constrained environments. The architecture design of such models is therefore critical, determining their performance, memory footprint, and compute efficiency. The Joint-embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has gained wide popularity in self-supervised learning for its simplicity and efficiency, but has been under-explored in cross-modal settings, partly due to the misconception that masking is intrinsic to JEPA. In this light, we propose CrossJEPA, a simple Cross-modal Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that harnesses the knowledge of an image foundation model and trains a predictor to infer embeddings of specific rendered 2D views from corresponding 3D point clouds, thereby introducing a JEPA-style pretraining strategy beyond masking. By conditioning the predictor on cross-domain projection information, CrossJEPA purifies the supervision signal from semantics exclusive to the target domain. We further exploit the frozen teacher design with a one-time target embedding caching mechanism, yielding amortized efficiency. CrossJEPA achieves a new state-of-the-art in linear probing on the synthetic ModelNet40 (94.2%) and the real-world ScanObjectNN (88.3%) benchmarks, using only 14.1M pretraining parameters (8.5M in the point encoder), and about 6 pretraining hours on a standard single GPU. These results position CrossJEPA as a performant, memory-efficient, and fast-to-train framework for 3D representation learning via knowledge distillation. We analyze CrossJEPA intuitively, theoretically, and empirically, and extensively ablate our design choices. Code will be made available.

TL;DR: DocPTBench is a benchmark for photographed document parsing and translation, revealing performance drops in models under real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to address real-world document capture challenges such as distortions and variations.

Method: Introduced DocPTBench: 1,300 high-resolution photographed documents with human-verified annotations across multiple domains.

Result: Performance drops by 18% for MLLMs and 25% for specialized models in parsing and translation tasks for photographed documents.

Conclusion: Real-world conditions significantly challenge existing models, highlighting the need for robust solutions.

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for end-to-end document parsing and translation. However, prevailing benchmarks such as OmniDocBench and DITrans are dominated by pristine scanned or digital-born documents, and thus fail to adequately represent the intricate challenges of real-world capture conditions, such as geometric distortions and photometric variations. To fill this gap, we introduce DocPTBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for Photographed Document Parsing and Translation. DocPTBench comprises over 1,300 high-resolution photographed documents from multiple domains, includes eight translation scenarios, and provides meticulously human-verified annotations for both parsing and translation. Our experiments demonstrate that transitioning from digital-born to photographed documents results in a substantial performance decline: popular MLLMs exhibit an average accuracy drop of 18% in end-to-end parsing and 12% in translation, while specialized document parsing models show significant average decrease of 25%. This substantial performance gap underscores the unique challenges posed by documents captured in real-world conditions and reveals the limited robustness of existing models.

### [292] [When Generative Replay Meets Evolving Deepfakes: Domain-Aware Relative Weighting for Incremental Face Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18436)
*Hao Shen,Jikang Cheng,Renye Yan,Zhongyuan Wang,Wei Peng,Baojin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work addresses challenges in gaze forgery detection during incremental learning by introducing Domain-Aware Relative Weighting (DARW), which improves learning using generative replay without causing domain overlap issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid advancements and variety in face generation have increased forgery methods, demanding adaptive incremental learning methods to counter them.

Method: Proposed the DARW strategy leveraging generative replay while utilizing domain-safe and domain-risky samples with a Relative Separation Loss and Domain Confusion Score.

Result: Experiments show improved forgery detection accuracy during incremental learning and mitigation of adverse effects from domain similarity.

Conclusion: DARW proves effective at enhancing incremental forgery detection with generative replay while addressing domain overlap challenges.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of face generation techniques has led to a growing variety of forgery methods. Incremental forgery detection aims to gradually update existing models with new forgery data, yet current sample replay-based methods are limited by low diversity and privacy concerns. Generative replay offers a potential solution by synthesizing past data, but its feasibility for forgery detection remains unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate generative replay and identify two scenarios: when the replay generator closely resembles the new forgery model, generated real samples blur the domain boundary, creating domain-risky samples; when the replay generator differs significantly, generated samples can be safely supervised, forming domain-safe samples. To exploit generative replay effectively, we propose a novel Domain-Aware Relative Weighting (DARW) strategy. DARW directly supervises domain-safe samples while applying a Relative Separation Loss to balance supervision and potential confusion for domain-risky samples. A Domain Confusion Score dynamically adjusts this tradeoff according to sample reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARW consistently improves incremental learning performance for forgery detection under different generative replay settings and alleviates the adverse impact of domain overlap.

TL;DR: PEARL enhances reasoning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by verifying visual perception, addressing issues like hallucinations and reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla RLVR for VLMs overlooks visual perception, causing reliability problems in reasoning due to flawed perception.

Method: PEARL introduces a dual-branch approach using perception-checklists to anchor reasoning to verified visual evidence, reinforced through perceptual rewards and fidelity gates.

Result: PEARL achieved notable improvements in multimodal reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both baseline and advanced RL methods like GRPO.

Conclusion: By integrating verified visual evidence into reasoning processes, PEARL strengthens multimodal reasoning capabilities and ensures reliability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is now being applied to Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, vanilla RLVR for VLMs verifies only the final textual output, critically neglecting the foundational step of visual perception. This oversight leads to visual hallucinations and reward hacking, as reasoning built upon flawed perception is inherently unreliable. To address this, we propose PEARL (Perceptual-Evidence Anchored Reinforced Learning), a dual-branch, perception-reasoning synergistic that strengthens multimodal reasoning by explicitly anchoring it to verified visual evidence. For each reasoning-oriented QA instance, PEARL first derive a perception checklist -- a set of perception-oriented sub-questions with verifiable answers that probe the model's understanding of key visual evidence. During training, auxiliary rollouts on this checklist yield a perceptual reward that both directly reinforces the model's perception ability and acts as a fidelity gate for reasoning. If the model passes the perception check, its policy update is biased towards evidence-anchored reasoning. Otherwise, the process is halted to prevent reasoning from flawed premises. PEARL can be seamlessly integrated with popular RL methods like GRPO and DAPO. Comprehensive experiments show PEARL achieves substantial gains on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, e.g., a +9.7% improvement over the baseline and +6.6% over GRPO on MathVerse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing 2D diffusion-based methods for editing 3D scenes, such as inconsistencies, poor control, and high computational costs.

Method: A user-friendly pipeline is introduced for precise region selection and recoloring in Gaussian Splatting scenes. An interactive tool is also developed to demonstrate real-time editing capabilities.

Result: The proposed method effectively enables real-time recoloring of specific regions in 3D scenes, overcoming prior limitations.

Conclusion: The study advances 3D editing tasks by offering a precise, intuitive, and computationally efficient approach for recoloring using Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a leading method for novel view synthesis, offering superior training efficiency and real-time inference compared to NeRF approaches, while still delivering high-quality reconstructions. Beyond view synthesis, this 3D representation has also been explored for editing tasks. Many existing methods leverage 2D diffusion models to generate multi-view datasets for training, but they often suffer from limitations such as view inconsistencies, lack of fine-grained control, and high computational demand. In this work, we focus specifically on the editing task of recoloring. We introduce a user-friendly pipeline that enables precise selection and recoloring of regions within a pre-trained Gaussian Splatting scene. To demonstrate the real-time performance of our method, we also present an interactive tool that allows users to experiment with the pipeline in practice.

*Arpit Garg,Hemanth Saratchandran,Simon Lucey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of unlearning specific knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Models without retraining, introducing the SineProject method to stabilize optimization and maintain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for MLLMs disrupt alignment between vision and language, leading to models rejecting both harmful and benign content.

Method: The paper proposes 'SineProject,' which enhances the projector network with sinusoidally modulated trainable parameters to improve optimization stability and maintain cross-modal alignment.

Result: SineProject reduces benign query refusals and completely forgets targeted information across benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art forget-retain balance with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: The SineProject method effectively addresses unlearning in MLLMs, ensuring safety and privacy without compromising benign capabilities or imposing significant computational overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly need to forget specific knowledge such as unsafe or private information without requiring full retraining. However, existing unlearning methods often disrupt vision language alignment, causing models to reject both harmful and benign queries. We trace this failure to the projector network during unlearning, its Jacobian becomes severely illconditioned, leading to unstable optimization and drift in cross modal embeddings. We introduce SineProject, a simple method that augments the frozen projector with sinusoidally modulated trainable parameters, improving the Jacobian's spectral conditioning and stabilizing alignment throughout unlearning. Across standard safety and privacy unlearning benchmarks using LLaVA v1.5 7B and 13B, SineProject reduces benign query refusals while achieving complete forgetting of targeted information, yielding state of the art forget retain trade offs with negligible computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EventBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for event-based vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of event-based MLLMs drives the development of EventBench.

Method: EventBench provides eight diverse task metrics, a large-scale event dataset, and unique features like openness, task diversity, integration of spatial reasoning, and large data volume.

Result: Evaluations reveal that current event-based MLLMs excel in event stream understanding but face challenges in fine-grained recognition and spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: EventBench facilitates the systematic assessment of MLLMs, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement in event-based tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in event-based vision, yet the comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities within a unified benchmark remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EventBench, a benchmark that offers eight diverse task metrics together with a large-scale event stream dataset. EventBench differs from existing event-based benchmarks in four key aspects: (1) openness in accessibility, releasing all raw event streams and task instructions across eight evaluation metrics; (2) diversity in task coverage, spanning understanding, recognition, and spatial reasoning tasks for comprehensive capability assessment; (3) integration in spatial dimensions, pioneering the design of 3D spatial reasoning tasks for event-based MLLMs; and (4) scale in data volume, with an accompanying training set of over one million event-text pairs supporting large-scale training and evaluation. Using EventBench, we evaluate state-of-the-art closed-source models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5 Pro, leading open-source models including Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL3, and event-based MLLMs such as EventGPT that directly process raw event streams. Extensive evaluation reveals that while current event-based MLLMs demonstrate strong performance in event stream understanding, they continue to struggle with fine-grained recognition and spatial reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing Neighborhood Attention Filtering (NAF), a zero-shot upsampling approach adaptable to any Vision Foundation Model (VFM), outperforming VFM-specific upsamplers and achieving state-of-the-art across pixel-level tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) which generate spatially downsampled representations, making pixel-level tasks challenging and current upsampling solutions inefficiently fixed or VFM-specific.

Method: The paper proposes the NAF architecture that learns adaptive spatial-and-content weights through Cross-Scale Neighborhood Attention and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), guided by high-resolution input images for efficient zero-shot upsampling.

Result: NAF surpasses VFM-specific upsampling approaches, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks, and performs zero-shot upsampling for any VFM while maintaining high efficiency and versatility.

Conclusion: NAF offers an efficient and VFM-agnostic solution for feature upsampling and image restoration, eliminating retraining burdens while ensuring top-tier performance across applications.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) extract spatially downsampled representations, posing challenges for pixel-level tasks. Existing upsampling approaches face a fundamental trade-off: classical filters are fast and broadly applicable but rely on fixed forms, while modern upsamplers achieve superior accuracy through learnable, VFM-specific forms at the cost of retraining for each VFM. We introduce Neighborhood Attention Filtering (NAF), which bridges this gap by learning adaptive spatial-and-content weights through Cross-Scale Neighborhood Attention and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), guided solely by the high-resolution input image. NAF operates zero-shot: it upsamples features from any VFM without retraining, making it the first VFM-agnostic architecture to outperform VFM-specific upsamplers and achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks. It maintains high efficiency, scaling to 2K feature maps and reconstructing intermediate-resolution maps at 18 FPS. Beyond feature upsampling, NAF demonstrates strong performance on image restoration, highlighting its versatility. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/valeoai/NAF.

### [298] [RegDeepLab: A Two-Stage Decoupled Framework for Interpretable Embryo Fragmentation Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18454)
*Ming-Jhe Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RegDeepLab, a model combining segmentation and regression to improve automated embryo grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual embryo fragmentation grading systems in IVF are subjective, time-intensive, and inconsistent. Existing automated deep learning models lack either clinical explainability or precise grading capabilities.

Method: The study introduces RegDeepLab, a dual-branch Multi-Task Learning framework integrating semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3+) and multi-scale regression, along with a Two-Stage Decoupled Training Strategy and a Range Loss for handling discrete data.

Result: Experimental results show that the decoupled strategy provides high-precision grading predictions while maintaining segmentation accuracy (Dice=0.729, MAE=0.046).

Conclusion: RegDeepLab offers a clinically viable solution combining automated, accurate grading with visual explainability for embryo assessment in IVF, overcoming limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: The degree of embryo fragmentation serves as a critical morphological indicator for assessing embryo developmental potential in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) clinical decision-making. However, current manual grading processes are not only time-consuming but also limited by significant inter-observer variability and efficiency bottlenecks. Although deep learning has demonstrated potential in automated grading in recent years, existing solutions face a significant challenge: pure regression models lack the visual explainability required for clinical practice, while pure segmentation models struggle to directly translate pixel-level masks into precise clinical grades. This study proposes RegDeepLab, a dual-branch Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework that integrates State-of-the-Art (SOTA) semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3+) with a multi-scale regression head. Addressing the common issues of "Gradient Conflict" and "Negative Transfer" in multi-task training, we propose a "Two-Stage Decoupled Training Strategy." Experimental results demonstrate that while standard end-to-end MTL training can minimize grading error (MAE=0.046) through our designed "Feature Injection" mechanism, it compromises the integrity of segmentation boundaries. In contrast, our decoupled strategy successfully provides robust and high-precision grading predictions while preserving SOTA-level segmentation accuracy (Dice=0.729). Furthermore, we introduce a "Range Loss" to effectively utilize large-scale discrete grading data for semi-supervised learning. This study ultimately presents a dual-module clinical auxiliary solution that combines high accuracy with visual explainability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a loop-based reasoning framework with an anti-hallucination reward to overcome visual perception issues in video reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models rely on a flawed single-step perception paradigm for video reasoning, leading to insufficient evidence and hallucination risks.

Method: The authors propose the Perception Loop Reasoning (PLR) paradigm for segment-wise analysis and decision-making, alongside a Factual-Aware Evaluator for anti-hallucination rewards.

Result: Video-PLR achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reasoning tasks across 3B and 7B parameter scales and demonstrates high data efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with PLR and FAE effectively addresses perception shortcuts and hallucination in video reasoning LLMs, improving accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Sufficient visual perception is the foundation of video reasoning. Nevertheless, existing Video Reasoning LLMs suffer from perception shortcuts, relying on a flawed single-step perception paradigm. This paradigm describes the video and then conducts reasoning, which runs the risk of insufficient evidence and emergent hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce a new framework that integrates a loop-based paradigm with an anti-hallucination reward. First, to address the insufficient evidence, we introduce the Perception Loop Reasoning (PLR) paradigm. Instead of describing the video at once, each loop requires the model to describe a video segment with precise timestamps, analyze this segment, and decide the next action. Second, for the risk of hallucinations, the Factual-Aware Evaluator (FAE) evaluates each perception result as a reliable anti-hallucination reward. This reward encourages the model to provide sufficient and precise video evidence. Our FAE, which performs comparably to GPT-4o, is tuned on our AnetHallu-117K, a large-scale hallucination judgment preference dataset. Extensive experiments show that our Video-PLR achieves the state-of-the-art in both 3B and 7B parameter scales and has the best data efficiency. Our code, models, and datasets are released on: https://github.com/BoweiPu/VideoPLR.

*Heeseung Yun,Joonil Na,Jaeyeon Kim,Calvin Murdock,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoSpanLift for predicting human visual perception in 3D environments, using spatio-temporal fusion with advanced modeling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting human visual perception in 3D environments to improve AR/VR and assistive technologies.

Method: EgoSpanLift converts SLAM-derived keypoints into geometry compatible with gaze detection, uses 3D U-Net and transformers for efficient visual span prediction.

Result: EgoSpanLift outperforms baselines in 2D gaze anticipation and 3D localization, maintaining strong results when projected back to 2D.

Conclusion: EgoSpanLift advances visual span forecasting by transitioning from 2D to 3D while effectively handling egocentric perception challenges.

Abstract: People continuously perceive and interact with their surroundings based on underlying intentions that drive their exploration and behaviors. While research in egocentric user and scene understanding has focused primarily on motion and contact-based interaction, forecasting human visual perception itself remains less explored despite its fundamental role in guiding human actions and its implications for AR/VR and assistive technologies. We address the challenge of egocentric 3D visual span forecasting, predicting where a person's visual perception will focus next within their three-dimensional environment. To this end, we propose EgoSpanLift, a novel method that transforms egocentric visual span forecasting from 2D image planes to 3D scenes. EgoSpanLift converts SLAM-derived keypoints into gaze-compatible geometry and extracts volumetric visual span regions. We further combine EgoSpanLift with 3D U-Net and unidirectional transformers, enabling spatio-temporal fusion to efficiently predict future visual span in the 3D grid. In addition, we curate a comprehensive benchmark from raw egocentric multisensory data, creating a testbed with 364.6K samples for 3D visual span forecasting. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines for egocentric 2D gaze anticipation and 3D localization while achieving comparable results even when projected back onto 2D image planes without additional 2D-specific training.

*Liav Hen,Tom Tirer,Raja Giryes,Shady Abu-Hussein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models achieve high-quality results for inverse imaging problems but balancing key components is challenging. This paper proposes an adaptive likelihood step-size approach, AdaPS, ensuring better reconstruction quality without task-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation addresses the existing challenge of balancing the diffusion model's prior with data fidelity in inverse problems, where improper balance leads to artifacts or slow convergence with suboptimal results.

Method: The proposed method, AdaPS, uses an adaptive likelihood step-size and observation-dependent weighting scheme. It dynamically aligns with the diffusion schedule and adjusts using intermediate likelihood gradient approximations.

Result: AdaPS improves reconstruction quality in imaging tasks (super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, motion deblurring) on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet-256, surpassing existing diffusion-based methods in perceptual quality while maintaining distortion.

Conclusion: AdaPS is hyperparameter-free, robust across varying conditions, and enhances diffusion-driven inverse problem solving without task-specific modifications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative priors for solving inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art results across various imaging tasks. A central challenge in this setting lies in balancing the contribution of the prior with the data fidelity term: overly aggressive likelihood updates may introduce artifacts, while conservative updates can slow convergence or yield suboptimal reconstructions. In this work, we propose an adaptive likelihood step-size strategy to guide the diffusion process for inverse-problem formulations. Specifically, we develop an observation-dependent weighting scheme based on the agreement between two different approximations of the intractable intermediate likelihood gradients, that adapts naturally to the diffusion schedule, time re-spacing, and injected stochasticity. The resulting approach, Adaptive Posterior diffusion Sampling (AdaPS), is hyperparameter-free and improves reconstruction quality across diverse imaging tasks - including super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring - on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet-256 validation sets. AdaPS consistently surpasses existing diffusion-based baselines in perceptual quality with minimal or no loss in distortion, without any task-specific tuning. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness to the number of diffusion steps, observation noise levels, and varying stochasticity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HSDiff, a novel Bayesian framework for hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction using diffusion priors and posterior diffusion sampling, improving spectral diversity and uncertainty calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of hyperspectral image reconstruction, particularly resolving issues caused by lack of spectral diversity and understanding its impact under the metamerism phenomenon.

Method: The paper uses Bayesian inference with a pixel-level diffusion prior and posterior diffusion sampling. It incorporates a metameric augmentation technique with region-based metameric black and partition-of-union spectral upsampling for training.

Result: HSDiff achieves calibrated, uncertainty-aware HSI reconstruction and shows the impact of forward models on posterior distributions. It improves spectral encoding capabilities in snapshot hyperspectral imaging.

Conclusion: This method highlights the importance of considering spectral encoding and demonstrates an effective approach to achieving diverse and uncertainty-aware HSI reconstruction with strong results.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image reconstruction from a compressed measurement is a highly ill-posed inverse problem. Current data-driven methods suffer from hallucination due to the lack of spectral diversity in existing hyperspectral image datasets, particularly when they are evaluated for the metamerism phenomenon. In this work, we formulate hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction as a Bayesian inference problem and propose a framework, HSDiff, that utilizes an unconditionally trained, pixel-level diffusion prior and posterior diffusion sampling to generate diverse HSI samples consistent with the measurements of various hyperspectral image formation models. We propose an enhanced metameric augmentation technique using region-based metameric black and partition-of-union spectral upsampling to expand training with physically valid metameric spectra, strengthening the prior diversity and improving uncertainty calibration. We utilize HSDiff to investigate how the studied forward models shape the posterior distribution and demonstrate that guiding with effective spectral encoding provides calibrated informative uncertainty compared to non-encoded models. Through the lens of the Bayesian framework, HSDiff offers a complete, high-performance method for uncertainty-aware HSI reconstruction. Our results also reiterate the significance of effective spectral encoding in snapshot hyperspectral imaging.

Motivation: Develop efficient vision-language AI models for real-time performance on low-power, limited-memory edge devices.

Method: Proposes Sparse Temporal Token Fusion (STTF) for event-driven change detection and Adaptive Neural Compression (ANC) for activating specific encoder branches based on scene complexity.

Result: TinyGPT-STTF surpasses previous models on the COCO 2017 test set in multiple metrics, reduces tokens by 84% on gesture tasks while maintaining accuracy, and lowers computational costs significantly.

Conclusion: These adaptive compression techniques enable highly capable vision-language models to be effectively deployed on edge devices.

Abstract: The demand for edge AI in vision-language tasks requires models that achieve real-time performance on resource-constrained devices with limited power and memory. This paper proposes two adaptive compression techniques -- Sparse Temporal Token Fusion (STTF) and Adaptive Neural Compression (ANC) -- that integrate algorithmic innovations with hardware-aware optimizations. Unlike previous approaches relying on static pruning or uniform scaling, STTF dynamically reuses visual tokens through event-driven change detection, while ANC conditionally activates encoder branches via a learned router, enabling fine-grained adaptation to scene complexity. Our 3B-parameter TinyGPT-STTF achieves CIDEr 131.2, BLEU-4 0.38, METEOR 0.31, and ROUGE-L 0.56 on the COCO 2017 test set, surpassing LLaVA-1.5 7B by 17.6 CIDEr points while using 2.3x fewer parameters and 62x fewer on-device FLOPs. TinyGPT-ANC reaches CIDEr 128.5. On event-based vision tasks, STTF reduces average token count by 84% (from 196 to 31 tokens) while preserving 95.6% accuracy on the DVS128 Gesture dataset, and ANC cuts FLOPs by up to 90% in low-motion scenes. Compared to strong baselines, our models improve accuracy by up to 4.4% and reduce latency by up to 13x. These results enable efficient deployment of capable vision-language models on real-world edge devices.

TL;DR: The paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and proposes a method called UNIFIER to handle visual discrepancies in continual learning tasks across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dynamic nature of downstream tasks in multimodal learning, involving different perspectives and scenarios, necessitates models that can adapt without forgetting previously learned tasks.

Method: The study introduces the MSVQA dataset, which spans high altitude, underwater, low altitude, and indoor scenarios, and proposes the UNIFIER method. UNIFIER separates visual data across scenarios into distinct branches and maintains stability via a consistency constraint.

Result: Experimental results on the MSVQA dataset show that UNIFIER significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting across scenarios and effectively accumulates knowledge within the same scenario.

Conclusion: The proposed approach of decoupling visual features into separate branches and constraining feature consistency proves effective for continual learning in dynamic multimodal scenarios.

Abstract: Continual learning in visual understanding aims to deal with catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs deployed on devices have to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks, such as variations in background and perspective, to effectively perform complex visual tasks. To this end, we construct a multimodal visual understanding dataset (MSVQA) encompassing four different scenarios and perspectives including high altitude, underwater, low altitude and indoor, to investigate the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under the dynamics of scenario shifts in real-world data streams. Furthermore, we propose mUltimodal coNtInual learning with MLLMs From multi-scenarIo pERspectives (UNIFIER) to address visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios. Specifically, it decouples the visual information from different scenarios into distinct branches within each vision block and projects them into the same feature space. A consistency constraint is imposed on the features of each branch to maintain the stability of visual representations across scenarios. Extensive experiments on the MSVQA dataset demonstrate that UNIFIER effectively alleviates forgetting of cross-scenario tasks and achieves knowledge accumulation within the same scenario.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Low-Rank Deep Unfolding Network (LRDUN) to improve reconstruction quality for spectral compressive imaging while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current paradigm in spectral compressive imaging reconstruction suffers from computational redundancy and challenges in mapping 2D measurements to 3D hyperspectral images.

Method: The authors propose novel imaging models using low-rank decomposition integrated with the sensing model, alongside a Generalized Feature Unfolding Mechanism (GFUM) within an unfolded proximal gradient descent framework.

Result: LRDUN achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with reduced computational cost, validated by extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates inherent ill-posedness issues and redundancies, enhancing reconstruction quality and computational efficiency for spectral compressive imaging.

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have achieved remarkable success and become the mainstream paradigm for spectral compressive imaging (SCI) reconstruction. Existing DUNs are derived from full-HSI imaging models, where each stage operates directly on the high-dimensional HSI, refining the entire data cube based on the single 2D coded measurement. However, this paradigm leads to computational redundancy and suffers from the ill-posed nature of mapping 2D residuals back to 3D space of HSI. In this paper, we propose two novel imaging models corresponding to the spectral basis and subspace image by explicitly integrating low-rank (LR) decomposition with the sensing model. Compared to recovering the full HSI, estimating these compact low-dimensional components significantly mitigates the ill-posedness. Building upon these novel models, we develop the Low-Rank Deep Unfolding Network (LRDUN), which jointly solves the two subproblems within an unfolded proximal gradient descent (PGD) framework. Furthermore, we introduce a Generalized Feature Unfolding Mechanism (GFUM) that decouples the physical rank in the data-fidelity term from the feature dimensionality in the prior module, enhancing the representational capacity and flexibility of the network. Extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed LRDUN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality with significantly reduced computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency and maintenance of solar panels by detecting dust and faults using a centralized platform, ensuring better energy output and operational sustainability.

Method: The method involves preprocessing solar panel images using gamma correction and Gaussian filtering, followed by employing CNN, ResNet, and KerNet models for detecting dust and faults on panels based on parameters like shadowing, pollution, droppings, and faults via thermal imaging.

Result: The model demonstrates high efficiency and accuracy in detecting dust and faults on solar panels, outperforming existing models during comparative evaluations.

Conclusion: This centralized model is effective in optimizing solar panel performance across various geographical areas and scales, making it valuable for sustainable management and energy utilization.

Abstract: Solar energy is one of the most abundant and tapped sources of renewable energies with enormous future potential. Solar panel output can vary widely with factors like intensity, temperature, dirt, debris and so on affecting it. We have implemented a model on detecting dust and fault on solar panels. These two applications are centralized as a single-platform and can be utilized for routine-maintenance and any other checks. These are checked against various parameters such as power output, sinusoidal wave (I-V component of solar cell), voltage across each solar cell and others. Firstly, we filter and preprocess the obtained images using gamma removal and Gaussian filtering methods alongside some predefined processes like normalization. The first application is to detect whether a solar cell is dusty or not based on various pre-determined metrics like shadowing, leaf, droppings, air pollution and from other human activities to extent of fine-granular solar modules. The other one is detecting faults and other such occurrences on solar panels like faults, cracks, cell malfunction using thermal imaging application. This centralized platform can be vital since solar panels have different efficiency across different geography (air and heat affect) and can also be utilized for small-scale house requirements to large-scale solar farm sustentation effectively. It incorporates CNN, ResNet models that with self-attention mechanisms-KerNet model which are used for classification and results in a fine-tuned system that detects dust or any fault occurring. Thus, this multi-application model proves to be efficient and optimized in detecting dust and faults on solar panels. We have performed various comparisons and findings that demonstrates that our model has better efficiency and accuracy results overall than existing models.

### [307] [Breaking Forgetting: Training-Free Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via Conditional Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18516)
*Haidong Kang,Ketong Qian,Yi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel training-free approach to Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) by replacing gradient-based updates with a Conditional Diffusion process and integrating visual and language features to overcome catastrophic forgetting and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address catastrophic forgetting and the computational cost explosion in FSCIL caused by gradient-based optimization, particularly under conditions of scarce data for newly introduced classes.

Method: The authors propose the Conditional Diffusion-driven FSCIL (CD-FSCIL) framework, replacing gradient-based updates with diffusion generative transitions for training-free adaptation. They introduce multimodal learning by integrating visual features with language data generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: Their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on mainstream FSCIL benchmarks, significantly reducing computational and memory overhead and improving generalization to novel classes.

Conclusion: The work introduces a paradigm shift in FSCIL by demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of a training-free approach that mitigates forgetting and enhances adaptation, marking progress toward practical, efficient continual learning.

Abstract: Efforts to overcome catastrophic forgetting in Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) have primarily focused on developing more effective gradient-based optimization strategies. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the training cost explosion that inevitably arises as the number of novel classes increases, a consequence of relying on gradient learning even under extreme data scarcity. More critically, since FSCIL typically provides only a few samples for each new class, gradient-based updates not only induce severe catastrophic forgetting on base classes but also hinder adaptation to novel ones. This paper seeks to break this long-standing limitation by asking: Can we design a training-free FSCIL paradigm that entirely removes gradient optimization? We provide an affirmative answer by uncovering an intriguing connection between gradient-based optimization and the Conditional Diffusion process. Building on this observation, we propose a Conditional Diffusion-driven FSCIL (CD-FSCIL) framework that substitutes the conventional gradient update process with a diffusion-based generative transition, enabling training-free incremental adaptation while effectively mitigating forgetting. Furthermore, to enhance representation under few-shot constraints, we introduce a multimodal learning strategy that integrates visual features with natural language descriptions automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). This synergy substantially alleviates the sample scarcity issue and improves generalization across novel classes. Extensive experiments on mainstream FSCIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also drastically reduces computational and memory overhead, marking a paradigm shift toward training-free continual adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DE-KAN, a new deep learning model to improve tooth segmentation accuracy from panoramic radiographs, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of segmenting individual teeth from panoramic radiographs, such as anatomical variations, irregular tooth shapes, and overlapping structures, which limit conventional deep learning model performance.

Method: The study introduces DE-KAN, a model integrating a dual encoder architecture using ResNet-18 and a custom CNN to extract global and local features, fused via Kolmogorov Arnold theorem-based layers with nonlinear learnable activation functions.

Conclusion: DE-KAN demonstrates the potential to set a new benchmark for teeth segmentation from panoramic radiographs, proving its efficiency and effectiveness for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of individual teeth from panoramic radiographs remains a challenging task due to anatomical variations, irregular tooth shapes, and overlapping structures. These complexities often limit the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this, we propose DE-KAN, a novel Dual Encoder Kolmogorov Arnold Network, which enhances feature representation and segmentation precision. The framework employs a ResNet-18 encoder for augmented inputs and a customized CNN encoder for original inputs, enabling the complementary extraction of global and local spatial features. These features are fused through KAN-based bottleneck layers, incorporating nonlinear learnable activation functions derived from the Kolmogorov Arnold representation theorem to improve learning capacity and interpretability. Extensive experiments on two benchmark dental X-ray datasets demonstrate that DE-KAN outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation models, achieving mIoU of 94.5%, Dice coefficient of 97.1%, accuracy of 98.91%, and recall of 97.36%, representing up to +4.7% improvement in Dice compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve MRI image reconstruction from undersampled k-space data while recovering high-frequency details and preserving anatomical structures.

Method: The proposed method uses: (i) SF-Lap for stable low/high-frequency decomposition; (ii) shared-routed MoE for adaptive per-pixel computation; (iii) global context fusion for anatomical coherence; all integrated into a data-consistency-regularized backbone.

Result: HiFi-MambaV2 consistently outperformed prior baselines in quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, NMSE) across multiple datasets and configurations, ensuring better high-frequency detail and structural fidelity.

Conclusion: HiFi-MambaV2 is a reliable and robust MRI reconstruction approach, advancing state-of-the-art methods for medical imaging workflows.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data requires recovering high-frequency details while maintaining anatomical coherence. We present HiFi-MambaV2, a hierarchical shared-routed Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Mamba architecture that couples frequency decomposition with content-adaptive computation. The model comprises two core components: (i) a separable frequency-consistent Laplacian pyramid (SF-Lap) that delivers alias-resistant, stable low- and high-frequency streams; and (ii) a hierarchical shared-routed MoE that performs per-pixel top-1 sparse dispatch to shared experts and local routers, enabling effective specialization with stable cross-depth behavior. A lightweight global context path is fused into an unrolled, data-consistency-regularized backbone to reinforce long-range reasoning and preserve anatomical coherence. Evaluated on fastMRI, CC359, ACDC, M4Raw, and Prostate158, HiFi-MambaV2 consistently outperforms CNN-, Transformer-, and prior Mamba-based baselines in PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE across single- and multi-coil settings and multiple acceleration factors, consistently surpassing consistent improvements in high-frequency detail and overall structural fidelity. These results demonstrate that HiFi-MambaV2 enables reliable and robust MRI reconstruction.

*Tuomas Varanka,Juan Luis Gonzalez,Hyeongwoo Kim,Pablo Garrido,Xu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a zero-shot video deraining method leveraging pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to effectively handle dynamic scenes, avoiding the need for synthetic data or model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video deraining face challenges in generalizing to real-world rain and dynamic scenarios due to reliance on synthetic data or datasets captured with static cameras. Fine-tuning diffusion models may also limit generalization to unseen cases.

Method: The authors use a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model, leveraging its generative capabilities to tackle rain removal by inverting the input video in latent space and applying a negative prompting technique. They include an attention switching mechanism to maintain consistency and dynamic backgrounds.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world rain datasets show substantial improvements over prior methods, with the approach generalizing well to diverse and unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: This method offers an innovative, robust solution for video deraining in dynamic environments without the need for supervised training, synthetic datasets, or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Existing video deraining methods are often trained on paired datasets, either synthetic, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world rain, or captured by static cameras, which restricts their effectiveness in dynamic scenes with background and camera motion. Furthermore, recent works in fine-tuning diffusion models have shown promising results, but the fine-tuning tends to weaken the generative prior, limiting generalization to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce the first zero-shot video deraining method for complex dynamic scenes that does not require synthetic data nor model fine-tuning, by leveraging a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. By inverting an input video into the latent space of diffusion models, its reconstruction process can be intervened and pushed away from the model's concept of rain using negative prompting. At the core of our approach is an attention switching mechanism that we found is crucial for maintaining dynamic backgrounds as well as structural consistency between the input and the derained video, mitigating artifacts introduced by naive negative prompting. Our approach is validated through extensive experiments on real-world rain datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods and showcasing robust generalization without the need for supervised training.

*Kuan Wei Huang,Brandon Li,Bharath Hariharan,Noah Snavely*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the C3 dataset, enabling improved photo-floor plan correspondence prediction. Current methods struggle with diverse modalities, e.g., ground photos vs. aerial views, and this dataset aims to address systematic challenges in cross-modal geometric reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems like DUSt3R perform poorly on inputs with vastly different viewpoints or modalities than their training set. In particular, challenges persist in connecting ground-level photos to floor plans.

Method: The C3 dataset is constructed by using 3D reconstructions of scenes from Internet photo collections via structure-from-motion and manually registering these reconstructions to Internet-sourced floor plans to derive correspondences.

Result: The C3 dataset provides 90K paired floor plans and photos across 597 scenes, with over 153M pixel-level correspondences and 85K camera poses. Training with this dataset improves performance by 34% in RMSE compared to the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: This novel dataset highlights weaknesses in current correspondence models and offers new opportunities for advancing photo-floor plan reasoning, thereby contributing to cross-modal geometric reasoning research.

Abstract: Geometric models like DUSt3R have shown great advances in understanding the geometry of a scene from pairs of photos. However, they fail when the inputs are from vastly different viewpoints (e.g., aerial vs. ground) or modalities (e.g., photos vs. abstract drawings) compared to what was observed during training. This paper addresses a challenging version of this problem: predicting correspondences between ground-level photos and floor plans. Current datasets for joint photo--floor plan reasoning are limited, either lacking in varying modalities (VIGOR) or lacking in correspondences (WAFFLE). To address these limitations, we introduce a new dataset, C3, created by first reconstructing a number of scenes in 3D from Internet photo collections via structure-from-motion, then manually registering the reconstructions to floor plans gathered from the Internet, from which we can derive correspondence between images and floor plans. C3 contains 90K paired floor plans and photos across 597 scenes with 153M pixel-level correspondences and 85K camera poses. We find that state-of-the-art correspondence models struggle on this task. By training on our new data, we can improve on the best performing method by 34% in RMSE. We also identify open challenges in cross-modal geometric reasoning that our dataset aims to help address.

*Wei Dong,Han Zhou,Junwei Lin,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised generative framework to restore dark images with low visibility, noise, and blur by leveraging visual autoregressive modeling and vision-language model perceptual priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dark images are difficult to restore due to low visibility, complex noise, and blur, and existing methods fail to handle dynamic illumination and blur effectively.

Method: The approach involves visual autoregressive modeling guided by VLM perceptual priors, adaptive curve estimation for illumination modulation, spatial-frequency-aware positional encodings, and recursive phase-domain modulation.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets without relying on paired data.

Conclusion: The proposed generative framework demonstrates effective restoration of challenging dark images using innovative unsupervised techniques incorporating perceptual guidance and dynamic processing.

Abstract: Real-world dark images commonly exhibit not only low visibility and contrast but also complex noise and blur, posing significant restoration challenges. Existing methods often rely on paired data or fail to model dynamic illumination and blur characteristics, leading to poor generalization. To tackle this, we propose a generative framework based on visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, guided by perceptual priors from the vision-language model (VLM). Specifically, to supply informative conditioning cues for VAR models, we deploy an adaptive curve estimation scheme to modulate the diverse illumination based on VLM-derived visibility scores. In addition, we integrate dynamic and spatial-frequency-aware Rotary Positional Encodings (SF-RoPE) into VAR to enhance its ability to model structures degraded by blur. Furthermore, we propose a recursive phase-domain modulation strategy that mitigates blur-induced artifacts in the phase domain via bounded iterative refinement guided by VLM-assessed blur scores. Our framework is fully unsupervised and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

*Wenhao Guo,Golrokh Mirzaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study benchmarked deep learning models on differentiating tumor progression from pseudoprogression in glioblastoma patients using follow-up MRI scans. Accuracy improved in later follow-ups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address the challenge of distinguishing true tumor progression from treatment-related pseudoprogression in glioblastoma, particularly during early follow-ups.

Method: Deep learning models of eleven representative architectures were trained using a patient-level cross-validation approach on MRI datasets. Stage-specific analysis was performed to assess performance at different time-points.

Result: Stage-specific benchmarking revealed improved discrimination at later follow-ups, with methods like hybrid CNN models offering the best accuracy-efficiency balance. However, performance remained modest overall due to dataset challenges.

Conclusion: This study highlights the complexity of differentiating between tumor progression and pseudoprogression, establishes benchmarks for follow-up MRI analysis, and proposes directions for future research.

Abstract: Differentiating true tumor progression (TP) from treatment-related pseudoprogression (PsP) in glioblastoma remains challenging, especially at early follow-up. We present the first stage-specific, cross-sectional benchmarking of deep learning models for follow-up MRI using the Burdenko GBM Progression cohort (n = 180). We analyze different post-RT scans independently to test whether architecture performance depends on time-point. Eleven representative DL families (CNNs, LSTMs, hybrids, transformers, and selective state-space models) were trained under a unified, QC-driven pipeline with patient-level cross-validation. Across both stages, accuracies were comparable (~0.70-0.74), but discrimination improved at the second follow-up, with F1 and AUC increasing for several models, indicating richer separability later in the care pathway. A Mamba+CNN hybrid consistently offered the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while transformer variants delivered competitive AUCs at substantially higher computational cost and lightweight CNNs were efficient but less reliable. Performance also showed sensitivity to batch size, underscoring the need for standardized training protocols. Notably, absolute discrimination remained modest overall, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of TP vs. PsP and the dataset's size imbalance. These results establish a stage-aware benchmark and motivate future work incorporating longitudinal modeling, multi-sequence MRI, and larger multi-center cohorts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeAR, a coupled neural asset-renderer pipeline that addresses the untapped potential of integrating neural asset authoring and neural rendering for enhanced graphics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional approaches to neural asset authoring and neural rendering are disjointed, both limiting the potential of end-to-end learnable graphics pipelines. The authors aim to explore how coupling these processes can lead to improvements in fidelity, consistency, and efficiency of graphic renderings.

Method: The authors propose NeAR, a pipeline where neural assets are generated using Trellis-style structured 3D latents paired with the novel Lighting-Homogenized SLAT. A lighting-aware neural renderer is used for relightable rendering with the aid of view embeddings and HDR environment maps. The approach focuses on combining structured latents and lighting-aware neural techniques for improved rendering.

Result: The NeAR framework was evaluated on four tasks: forward rendering, single-image reconstruction under different lighting conditions, relighting from unknown input lighting, and novel-view relighting. It consistently outperformed existing baselines in both numerical evaluation and perceived visual quality.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the advantage of treating neural asset authoring and neural rendering as interdependent processes. This joint framework introduces an innovative way to enhance graphics rendering pipelines and sets the stage for future research into co-designed neural asset-renderer stacks.

Abstract: Neural asset authoring and neural rendering have emerged as fundamentally disjoint threads: one generates digital assets using neural networks for traditional graphics pipelines, while the other develops neural renderers that map conventional assets to images. However, the potential of jointly designing the asset representation and renderer remains largely unexplored. We argue that coupling them can unlock an end-to-end learnable graphics stack with benefits in fidelity, consistency, and efficiency. In this paper, we explore this possibility with NeAR: a Coupled Neural Asset-Renderer Stack. On the asset side, we build on Trellis-style Structured 3D Latents and introduce a lighting-homogenized neural asset: from a casually lit input, a rectified-flow backbone predicts a Lighting-Homogenized SLAT that encodes geometry and intrinsic material cues in a compact, view-agnostic latent. On the renderer side, we design a lighting-aware neural renderer that uses this neural asset, along with explicit view embeddings and HDR environment maps, to achieve real-time, relightable rendering. We validate NeAR on four tasks: (1) G-buffer-based forward rendering, (2) random-lit single-image reconstruction, (3) unknown-lit single-image relighting, and (4) novel-view relighting. Our coupled stack surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality. We hope this coupled asset-renderer perspective inspires future graphics stacks that view neural assets and renderers as co-designed components instead of independent entities.

*Wenchao Ma,Dario Kneubuehler,Maurice Chu,Ian Sachs,Haomiao Jiang,Sharon Xiaolei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RigAnyFace (RAF), a new framework for auto-rigging facial meshes of varied topologies, including disconnected components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently and accurately rigging facial meshes across diverse topologies and components, as manual rigging is highly expensive and limited in scalability.

Method: The method involves using a neural framework with a surface learning network and tailored architecture design, supported by a curated dataset with limited artist-rigged meshes and a scaled training approach with 2D supervision for unlabeled meshes.

Result: RAF successfully rigs diverse topology meshes, including 'in-the-wild' samples, outperforming previous methods in accuracy and generalizability along with support for detailed animations like disconnected components.

Conclusion: RAF introduces a scalable and generalizable auto-rigging solution for facial meshes, enhancing accuracy and addressing limitations of manual rigging and disconnected components in facial animation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present RigAnyFace (RAF), a scalable neural auto-rigging framework for facial meshes of diverse topologies, including those with multiple disconnected components. RAF deforms a static neutral facial mesh into industry-standard FACS poses to form an expressive blendshape rig. Deformations are predicted by a triangulation-agnostic surface learning network augmented with our tailored architecture design to condition on FACS parameters and efficiently process disconnected components. For training, we curated a dataset of facial meshes, with a subset meticulously rigged by professional artists to serve as accurate 3D ground truth for deformation supervision. Due to the high cost of manual rigging, this subset is limited in size, constraining the generalization ability of models trained exclusively on it. To address this, we design a 2D supervision strategy for unlabeled neutral meshes without rigs. This strategy increases data diversity and allows for scaled training, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of models trained on this augmented data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAF is able to rig meshes of diverse topologies on not only our artist-crafted assets but also in-the-wild samples, outperforming previous works in accuracy and generalizability. Moreover, our method advances beyond prior work by supporting multiple disconnected components, such as eyeballs, for more detailed expression animation.

Motivation: Effectively detect retinal diseases from fundus images, addressing challenges like imaging variability, subtle disease manifestations, and dataset domain shifts.

Method: A Vision Transformer classifier was evaluated using various augmentation and enhancement strategies on multiple public datasets, complemented by a GANomaly-based anomaly detector for reconstruction-based explainability and unseen data generalization.

Result: ViT achieved accuracies between 0.789 and 0.843, with notable successes in detecting diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Geometric and color augmentations improved performance, while Laplacian enhancement reduced it. GANomaly detector achieved an AUC of 0.76.

Conclusion: ViT demonstrates effective classification, outperforming convolutional methods, with augmentation strategies optimizing detection. Integration of GUESS calibration aids potential clinical applications, and GANomaly contributes explainability and robustness for anomaly detection.

Abstract: Reliable detection of retinal diseases from fundus images is challenged by the variability in imaging quality, subtle early-stage manifestations, and domain shift across datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluated a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier under multiple augmentation and enhancement strategies across several heterogeneous public datasets, as well as the AEyeDB dataset, a high-quality fundus dataset created in-house and made available for the research community. The ViT demonstrated consistently strong performance, with accuracies ranging from 0.789 to 0.843 across datasets and diseases. Diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration were detected reliably, whereas glaucoma remained the most frequently misclassified disease. Geometric and color augmentations provided the most stable improvements, while histogram equalization benefited datasets dominated by structural subtlety. Laplacian enhancement reduced performance across different settings.
  On the Papila dataset, the ViT with geometric augmentation achieved an AUC of 0.91, outperforming previously reported convolutional ensemble baselines (AUC of 0.87), underscoring the advantages of transformer architectures and multi-dataset training. To complement the classifier, we developed a GANomaly-based anomaly detector, achieving an AUC of 0.76 while providing inherent reconstruction-based explainability and robust generalization to unseen data. Probabilistic calibration using GUESS enabled threshold-independent decision support for future clinical implementation.

Motivation: Frontier AI models like GPT-5 lack access to private neuroimaging data, limiting their efficacy in clinical contexts.

Method: Introduced NeuroVFM, trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a volumetric predictive architecture with visual instruction tuning.

Result: NeuroVFM demonstrates emergent neuroanatomic understanding, reduces critical errors and hallucinations, and generates accurate radiology reports with expert preference.

Conclusion: NeuroVFM establishes health system learning as a paradigm for developing high-performance generalist medical AI models using clinical data.

Abstract: Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5 and Meta's DINOv3, have advanced rapidly through training on internet-scale public data, yet such systems lack access to private clinical data. Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support. These results establish health system learning as a paradigm for building generalist medical AI and provide a scalable framework for clinical foundation models.

TL;DR: The paper tackles MRI tumor segmentation challenges using a novel automated framework, Tumor Fabrication (TF), leveraging healthy scans and minimal annotated data to synthesize paired data for improved segmentation in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of annotated MRI tumor data hinders accurate and automated tumor segmentation. Existing synthesis methods are either labor-intensive or require impractical amounts of training data.

Method: The Tumor Fabrication framework consists of two stages: coarse tumor synthesis and refinement using generative models. It utilizes healthy MRI scans and minimal annotated data for scalable data enrichment.

Result: Synthetic image-label pairs generated by TF significantly enhance tumor segmentation performance in low-data settings.

Conclusion: TF provides a scalable and effective solution for overcoming data scarcity in clinical AI, improving segmentation tasks through automated synthetic data generation.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) tumor data presents a major obstacle to accurate and automated tumor segmentation. While existing data synthesis methods offer promising solutions, they often suffer from key limitations: manual modeling is labor intensive and requires expert knowledge. Deep generative models may be used to augment data and annotation, but they typically demand large amounts of training pairs in the first place, which is impractical in data limited clinical settings. In this work, we propose Tumor Fabrication (TF), a novel two-stage framework for unpaired 3D brain tumor synthesis. The framework comprises a coarse tumor synthesis process followed by a refinement process powered by a generative model. TF is fully automated and leverages only healthy image scans along with a limited amount of real annotated data to synthesize large volumes of paired synthetic data for enriching downstream supervised segmentation training. We demonstrate that our synthetic image-label pairs used as data enrichment can significantly improve performance on downstream tumor segmentation tasks in low-data regimes, offering a scalable and reliable solution for medical image enrichment and addressing critical challenges in data scarcity for clinical AI applications.

*Harrison Bagley,Will Meakin,Simon Lucey,Yee Wei Law,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of physical adversarial attacks on deep learning systems by introducing superpixel-based regularization for scale-resilient adversarial patch optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the physical realizability and robustness of adversarial patches against scale variability, a factor that has received little attention but significantly affects the adversarial signal.

Method: The authors propose a superpixel-based regularization method using the SLIC algorithm to dynamically cluster pixels during optimization. Gradients are backpropagated through SLIC using the Implicit Function Theorem to enhance scale-resilient structures.

Result: The method improves adversarial patch performance in both the digital domain and real-world conditions, with scale-resilient patches less affected by interpolation losses.

Conclusion: The approach leads to better physical adversarial attack effectiveness and preserves adversarial robustness under varied real-world conditions, validated through a novel evaluation protocol.

Abstract: Physical adversarial attacks on deep learning systems is concerning due to the ease of deploying such attacks, usually by placing an adversarial patch in a scene to manipulate the outcomes of a deep learning model. Training such patches typically requires regularization that improves physical realizability (e.g., printability, smoothness) and/or robustness to real-world variability (e.g. deformations, viewing angle, noise). One type of variability that has received little attention is scale variability. When a patch is rescaled, either digitally through downsampling/upsampling or physically through changing imaging distances, interpolation-induced color mixing occurs. This smooths out pixel values, resulting in a loss of high-frequency patterns and degrading the adversarial signal. To address this, we present a novel superpixel-based regularization method that guides patch optimization to scale-resilient structures. Our ap proach employs the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm to dynamically cluster pixels in an adversarial patch during optimization. The Implicit Function Theorem is used to backpropagate gradients through SLIC to update the superpixel boundaries and color. This produces patches that maintain their structure over scale and are less susceptible to interpolation losses. Our method achieves greater performance in the digital domain, and when realized physically, these performance gains are preserved, leading to improved physical performance. Real-world performance was objectively assessed using a novel physical evaluation protocol that utilizes screens and cardboard cut-outs to systematically vary real-world conditions.

Method: A generative AI-based data augmentation pipeline combining geometric perspective transformation, AI-driven inpainting, and vehicle body overlays is utilized to simulate real-world viewpoints while maintaining lane integrity.

Result: Experimental results show that training with the augmented data improves robustness to varied conditions, enhancing precision, recall, and F1 scores for SCNN and UFLDv2 models.

Conclusion: This framework bridges dataset limitations and deployment scenarios, presenting a scalable solution for reliable lane detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: Robust lane detection is essential for advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving, yet models trained on public datasets such as CULane often fail to generalise across different camera viewpoints. This paper addresses the challenge of domain shift for side-mounted cameras used in lane-wheel monitoring by introducing a generative AI-based data enhancement pipeline. The approach combines geometric perspective transformation, AI-driven inpainting, and vehicle body overlays to simulate deployment-specific viewpoints while preserving lane continuity. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation in two state-of-the-art models, SCNN and UFLDv2. With the augmented data trained, both models show improved robustness to different conditions, including shadows. The experimental results demonstrate gains in precision, recall, and F1 score compared to the pre-trained model.
  By bridging the gap between widely available datasets and deployment-specific scenarios, our method provides a scalable and practical framework to improve the reliability of lane detection in a pilot deployment scenario.

*Yuchen Xia,Souvik Kundu,Mosharaf Chowdhury,Nishil Talati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sphinx, a hybrid framework aiming to balance high-quality and efficient inference in Novel View Synthesis (NVS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between high computational cost of diffusion-based NVS and suboptimal quality of regression-based NVS by achieving diffusion-level image fidelity at reduced compute.

Method: Sphinx combines fast regression-based initialization with selective refinement using adaptive noise scheduling, optimizing performance-quality trade-offs in dynamic inference situations.

Result: Sphinx achieves an average 1.8x speedup over diffusion model inference while maintaining image degradation of less than 5%.

Conclusion: Sphinx establishes a new balance between quality and latency in NVS rendering, offering adaptable performance for varying computational needs.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is the task of generating new images of a scene from viewpoints that were not part of the original input. Diffusion-based NVS can generate high-quality, temporally consistent images, however, remains computationally prohibitive. Conversely, regression-based NVS offers suboptimal generation quality despite requiring significantly lower compute; leaving the design objective of a high-quality, inference-efficient NVS framework an open challenge. To close this critical gap, we present Sphinx, a training-free hybrid inference framework that achieves diffusion-level fidelity at a significantly lower compute. Sphinx proposes to use regression-based fast initialization to guide and reduce the denoising workload for the diffusion model. Additionally, it integrates selective refinement with adaptive noise scheduling, allowing more compute to uncertain regions and frames. This enables Sphinx to provide flexible navigation of the performance-quality trade-off, allowing adaptation to latency and fidelity requirements for dynamically changing inference scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Sphinx achieves an average 1.8x speedup over diffusion model inference with negligible perceptual degradation of less than 5%, establishing a new Pareto frontier between quality and latency in NVS serving.

TL;DR: Edit2Perceive adapts image-editing diffusion models for dense perception tasks like depth, normal, and matting with a unified framework, offering faster runtime and state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of stochastic text-to-image generators in dense perception tasks and leverage the consistency of image-editing diffusion models.

Method: The Edit2Perceive framework utilizes full-parameter fine-tuning, pixel-space consistency loss, and deterministic inference for structure-preserving refinement in dense perception tasks.

Result: Edit2Perceive achieves state-of-the-art performance in depth, normal, and matting tasks, with faster runtime using relatively small datasets.

Conclusion: Image-editing diffusion models provide a promising foundation for geometry-aware visual perception tasks, as demonstrated by Edit2Perceive's success.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers have shown remarkable generalization in visual synthesis, yet most dense perception methods still rely on text-to-image (T2I) generators designed for stochastic generation. We revisit this paradigm and show that image editing diffusion models are inherently image-to-image consistent, providing a more suitable foundation for dense perception task. We introduce Edit2Perceive, a unified diffusion framework that adapts editing models for depth, normal, and matting. Built upon the FLUX.1 Kontext architecture, our approach employs full-parameter fine-tuning and a pixel-space consistency loss to enforce structure-preserving refinement across intermediate denoising states. Moreover, our single-step deterministic inference yields up to faster runtime while training on relatively small datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate comprehensive state-of-the-art results across all three tasks, revealing the strong potential of editing-oriented diffusion transformers for geometry-aware perception.

TL;DR: MedVision introduces a large-scale dataset and benchmark to improve vision-language models (VLMs) in quantitative medical image analysis, addressing tasks like detection, size estimation, and measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in vision-language models that lack support for quantitative reasoning, crucial for clinical decision-making.

Method: MedVision spans 22 public datasets with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs and focuses on supervised fine-tuning of VLMs on three quantitative medical imaging tasks.

Result: Supervised fine-tuning significantly improves performance of VLMs on quantitative medical imaging tasks, reducing error rates and boosting precision.

Conclusion: MedVision establishes a robust foundation for enhancing VLMs' quantitative reasoning in medical imaging, benefiting clinical applications.

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine are primarily designed for categorical question answering (e.g., "Is this normal or abnormal?") or qualitative descriptive tasks. However, clinical decision-making often relies on quantitative assessments, such as measuring the size of a tumor or the angle of a joint, from which physicians draw their own diagnostic conclusions. This quantitative reasoning capability remains underexplored and poorly supported in existing VLMs. In this work, we introduce MedVision, a large-scale dataset and benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and improve VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis. MedVision spans 22 public datasets covering diverse anatomies and modalities, with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs. We focus on three representative quantitative tasks: (1) detection of anatomical structures and abnormalities, (2) tumor/lesion (T/L) size estimation, and (3) angle/distance (A/D) measurement. Our benchmarks show that current off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these tasks. However, with supervised fine-tuning on MedVision, we significantly enhance their performance across detection, T/L estimation, and A/D measurement, demonstrating reduced error rates and improved precision. This work provides a foundation for developing VLMs with robust quantitative reasoning capabilities in medical imaging. Code and data are available at https://medvision-vlm.github.io.

TL;DR: KTCAA is proposed for sketch-based person re-identification with improved few-shot cross-modal generalization using alignment augmentation and knowledge transfer catalyst.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges posed by significant modality gaps and limited annotated data in sketch-based person re-identification.

Method: KTCAA involves two key components: Alignment Augmentation (AA) for localized sketch transformations and Knowledge Transfer Catalyst (KTC) for invariance enhancement, optimized under a meta-learning paradigm.

Result: Experiments show KTCAA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, especially in scenarios with limited data.

Conclusion: KTCAA proves effective in bridging modality gaps and enhancing robustness for sketch-based cross-modal person re-identification.

Abstract: Sketch based person re-identification aims to match hand-drawn sketches with RGB surveillance images, but remains challenging due to significant modality gaps and limited annotated data. To address this, we introduce KTCAA, a theoretically grounded framework for few-shot cross-modal generalization. Motivated by generalization theory, we identify two key factors influencing target domain risk: (1) domain discrepancy, which quantifies the alignment difficulty between source and target distributions; and (2) perturbation invariance, which evaluates the model's robustness to modality shifts. Based on these insights, we propose two components: (1) Alignment Augmentation (AA), which applies localized sketch-style transformations to simulate target distributions and facilitate progressive alignment; and (2) Knowledge Transfer Catalyst (KTC), which enhances invariance by introducing worst-case perturbations and enforcing consistency. These modules are jointly optimized under a meta-learning paradigm that transfers alignment knowledge from data-rich RGB domains to sketch-based scenarios. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KTCAA achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in data-scarce conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural geometry image-based representation for 3D meshes that is decoder-free, storage-efficient, and enables high-quality restoration in a single forward pass through a geometry image format.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient storage and processing for 3D meshes are needed, but existing solutions relying on neural overfitting face challenges like computational cost and complex architectures for irregular mesh connectivity.

Method: The method transforms irregular mesh data into a regular geometry image grid using Optimal Transport (OT), enabling continuous levels of detail (LoD) via a geometry-image mipmap for straightforward restoration.

Result: Experimental outcomes show superior storage and restoration metrics, improving compression ratio (CR), Chamfer distance (CD), and Hausdorff distance (HD).

Conclusion: The proposed approach leverages neural processing efficiently, achieves high-quality mesh reconstruction, and offers state-of-the-art performance in mesh storage and restoration.

Abstract: Neural representations for 3D meshes are emerging as an effective solution for compact storage and efficient processing. Existing methods often rely on neural overfitting, where a coarse mesh is stored and progressively refined through multiple decoder networks. While this can restore high-quality surfaces, it is computationally expensive due to successive decoding passes and the irregular structure of mesh data. In contrast, images have a regular structure that enables powerful super-resolution and restoration frameworks, but applying these advantages to meshes is difficult because their irregular connectivity demands complex encoder-decoder architectures. Our key insight is that a geometry image-based representation transforms irregular meshes into a regular image grid, making efficient image-based neural processing directly applicable. Building on this idea, we introduce our neural geometry image-based representation, which is decoder-free, storage-efficient, and naturally suited for neural processing. It stores a low-resolution geometry-image mipmap of the surface, from which high-quality meshes are restored in a single forward pass. To construct geometry images, we leverage Optimal Transport (OT), which resolves oversampling in flat regions and undersampling in feature-rich regions, and enables continuous levels of detail (LoD) through geometry-image mipmapping. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art storage efficiency and restoration accuracy, measured by compression ratio (CR), Chamfer distance (CD), and Hausdorff distance (HD).

*Xiang Gao,Xinmu Wang,Zhou Zhao,Junqi Huang,Xianfeng David Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a fast and accurate phase unwrapping framework for structured-light scanning, utilizing GraphCut reformulation and diffeomorphisms, achieving significant speedup and accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured-light scanning suffers from challenges such as noise and occlusions in phase unwrapping, resulting in a trade-off between speed and accuracy. The motivation is to develop a solution that ensures both, suitable for real-time applications.

Method: The authors reformulate GraphCut-based phase unwrapping as a pixel-labeling problem and introduce diffeomorphisms in image space via conformal and optimal transport maps. Pre-computed diffeomorphisms and hierarchical GraphCut algorithms are fused via majority voting.

Result: The proposed framework achieves a 45.5x speedup and a lower L2 error in both real-world experiments and simulations, showcasing its effectiveness and potential for real-time use.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances structured-light scanning phase unwrapping, balancing precision and speed, paving the way for real-time applications.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid advancements in 3D scanning technologies, with applications spanning VR/AR, digital human creation, and medical imaging. Structured-light scanning with phase-shifting techniques is preferred for its use of low-intensity visible light and high accuracy, making it well suited for capturing 4D facial dynamics. A key step is phase unwrapping, which recovers continuous phase values from measurements wrapped modulo 2pi. The goal is to estimate the unwrapped phase count k in the equation Phi = phi + 2pi k, where phi is the wrapped phase and Phi is the true phase. Noise, occlusions, and complex 3D geometry make recovering the true phase challenging because phase unwrapping is ill-posed: measurements only provide modulo 2pi values, and estimating k requires assumptions about surface continuity. Existing methods trade speed for accuracy: fast approaches lack precision, while accurate algorithms are too slow for real-time use. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a phase unwrapping framework that reformulates GraphCut-based unwrapping as a pixel-labeling problem. This framework improves the estimation of the unwrapped phase count k through the invariance property of diffeomorphisms applied in image space via conformal and optimal transport (OT) maps. An odd number of diffeomorphisms are precomputed from the input phase data, and a hierarchical GraphCut algorithm is applied in each domain. The resulting label maps are fused via majority voting to robustly estimate k at each pixel. Experimental results demonstrate a 45.5x speedup and lower L2 error in real experiments and simulations, showing potential for real-time applications.

*Shristi Das Biswas,Arani Roy,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICE introduces a training-free method for removing specific concepts in text-to-image and text-to-video models while preserving generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safely deploy text-to-image and text-to-video models by removing unwanted concepts without compromising model functionality or security.

Method: ICE employs a one-shot weight modification, defining erase and preserve subspaces with anisotropic energy-weighted scaling and uses a Spectral Unlearning Objective to create a dissociation operator for permanent concept removal.

Result: ICE enables precise erasure of various concepts in both T2I and T2V models with minimal degradation and robustness against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The approach offers a modality-agnostic and efficient solution for safe and effective concept erasure in generative models without affecting runtime performance.

Abstract: Robust concept removal for text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) models is essential for their safe deployment. Existing methods, however, suffer from costly retraining, inference overhead, or vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Crucially, they rarely model the latent semantic overlap between the target erase concept and surrounding content -- causing collateral damage post-erasure -- and even fewer methods work reliably across both T2I and T2V domains. We introduce Instant Concept Erasure (ICE), a training-free, modality-agnostic, one-shot weight modification approach that achieves precise, persistent unlearning with zero overhead. ICE defines erase and preserve subspaces using anisotropic energy-weighted scaling, then explicitly regularises against their intersection using a unique, closed-form overlap projector. We pose a convex and Lipschitz-bounded Spectral Unlearning Objective, balancing erasure fidelity and intersection preservation, that admits a stable and unique analytical solution. This solution defines a dissociation operator that is translated to the model's text-conditioning layers, making the edit permanent and runtime-free. Across targeted removals of artistic styles, objects, identities, and explicit content, ICE efficiently achieves strong erasure with improved robustness to red-teaming, all while causing only minimal degradation of original generative abilities in both T2I and T2V models.

TL;DR: This paper explores end-to-end 3D object detection with fisheye camera systems and introduces two new fisheye-compatible methods that improve detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research investigates the challenges of adapting traditional pinhole-based 3D object detection techniques to fisheye imagery, where performance is hindered by the unique fisheye geometry.

Method: Two methods—FisheyeBEVDet and FisheyePETR—are introduced. Both leverage spherical spatial representations to address fisheye image geometry within mainstream detection frameworks.

Result: The proposed methods improve detection accuracy by up to 6.2% as demonstrated on the new fisheye-specific benchmark, Fisheye3DOD, created using the CARLA simulator.

Conclusion: Incorporating fisheye geometry into detection frameworks can significantly improve 3D object detection performance on fisheye imagery, supported by benchmark results from a novel dataset.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the technical feasibility of implementing end-to-end 3D object detection (3DOD) with surround-view fisheye camera system. Specifically, we first investigate the performance drop incurred when transferring classic pinhole-based 3D object detectors to fisheye imagery. To mitigate this, we then develop two methods that incorporate the unique geometry of fisheye images into mainstream detection frameworks: one based on the bird's-eye-view (BEV) paradigm, named FisheyeBEVDet, and the other on the query-based paradigm, named FisheyePETR. Both methods adopt spherical spatial representations to effectively capture fisheye geometry. In light of the lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks, we release Fisheye3DOD, a new open dataset synthesized using CARLA and featuring both standard pinhole and fisheye camera arrays. Experiments on Fisheye3DOD show that our fisheye-compatible modeling improves accuracy by up to 6.2% over baseline methods.

*Jiarui Xue,Dongjian Yang,Ye Sun,Gang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a dendritic convolution inspired by neuron dendrites to improve image recognition in noisy environments, demonstrating significant accuracy and mAP improvement over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image recognition faces challenges from noise interference, and current solutions focusing on adjusting networks or training have reached a performance limit. Investigating a new neuronal-inspired approach could address this gap.

Method: The paper proposes dendritic convolution that mimics neuron dendrites' structure and computation logic, introducing nonlinear feature interactions. This redesigns the mathematical paradigm of convolution for improved noise resistance.

Result: The method shows impressive improvements: EfficientNet-B0's accuracy on noisy datasets increased by 11.23%, and YOLOv8's mean Average Precision (mAP) rose by 19.80%, outperforming traditional convolutions.

Conclusion: Dendritic convolution, inspired by biological neurons, offers superior noise resilience compared to traditional methods, making it highly suitable for noisy data in image recognition tasks.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios of image recognition, there exists substantial noise interference. Existing works primarily focus on methods such as adjusting networks or training strategies to address noisy image recognition, and the anti-noise performance has reached a bottleneck. However, little is known about the exploration of anti-interference solutions from a neuronal perspective.This paper proposes an anti-noise neuronal convolution. This convolution mimics the dendritic structure of neurons, integrates the neighborhood interaction computation logic of dendrites into the underlying design of convolutional operations, and simulates the XOR logic preprocessing function of biological dendrites through nonlinear interactions between input features, thereby fundamentally reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction. Unlike traditional convolution where noise directly interferes with feature extraction and exerts a significant impact, DDC mitigates the influence of noise by focusing on the interaction of neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate that in image classification tasks (using YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, and EfficientNet-B0) and object detection tasks (using YOLOv11, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5), after replacing traditional convolution with the dendritic convolution, the accuracy of the EfficientNet-B0 model on noisy datasets is relatively improved by 11.23%, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv8 is increased by 19.80%. The consistency between the computation method of this convolution and the dendrites of biological neurons enables it to perform significantly better than traditional convolution in complex noisy environments.

TL;DR: ObjectAlign is a framework to detect, verify, and correct inconsistencies in edited videos, offering improvements in perceptual and temporal quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address object-level and temporal inconsistencies such as frame flicker and identity drift in video editing to enhance perceptual quality.

Method: It introduces learnable thresholds for object consistency metrics, a neuro-symbolic verifier for identity and temporal fidelity checks, and neural network-based interpolation for adaptive frame repair.

Result: ObjectAlign achieves up to 1.4 point improvement in CLIP Score and up to 6.1 point improvement in warp error compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ObjectAlign is effective at detecting and correcting inconsistencies in edited video sequences, ensuring better perceptual stability and temporal correctness.

Abstract: Video editing and synthesis often introduce object inconsistencies, such as frame flicker and identity drift that degrade perceptual quality. To address these issues, we introduce ObjectAlign, a novel framework that seamlessly blends perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect, verify, and correct object-level and temporal inconsistencies in edited video sequences. The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed "consistent" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected. This enables reconstruction of the corrupted frames from the last valid and next valid keyframes. Our results show up to 1.4 point improvement in CLIP Score and up to 6.1 point improvement in warp error compared to SOTA baselines on the DAVIS and Pexels video datasets.

Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models, like Stable Diffusion, are suboptimal for compression tasks, particularly at ultra-low bitrates, limiting their potential for diffusion-based codecs.

Method: Introduced CoD, a compression-oriented diffusion model trained from scratch to enable efficient end-to-end compression and generation workflows, designed as a general model for various downstream codecs.

Result: CoD achieves state-of-the-art compression at ultra-low bitrates, trains 300 times faster than Stable Diffusion, and demonstrates high perceptual quality, surpassing GAN-based codecs in some scenarios.

Conclusion: CoD sets a new benchmark for diffusion codec research through its efficiency, reproducibility, and enhanced insights, establishing itself as a versatile foundation model for future advancements.

Abstract: Existing diffusion codecs typically build on text-to-image diffusion foundation models like Stable Diffusion. However, text conditioning is suboptimal from a compression perspective, hindering the potential of downstream diffusion codecs, particularly at ultra-low bitrates. To address it, we introduce \textbf{CoD}, the first \textbf{Co}mpression-oriented \textbf{D}iffusion foundation model, trained from scratch to enable end-to-end optimization of both compression and generation. CoD is not a fixed codec but a general foundation model designed for various diffusion-based codecs. It offers several advantages: \textbf{High compression efficiency}, replacing Stable Diffusion with CoD in downstream codecs like DiffC achieves SOTA results, especially at ultra-low bitrates (e.g., 0.0039 bpp); \textbf{Low-cost and reproducible training}, 300$\times$ faster training than Stable Diffusion ($\sim$ 20 vs. $\sim$ 6,250 A100 GPU days) on entirely open image-only datasets; \textbf{Providing new insights}, e.g., We find pixel-space diffusion can achieve VTM-level PSNR with high perceptual quality and can outperform GAN-based codecs using fewer parameters. We hope CoD lays the foundation for future diffusion codec research. Codes will be released.

*Yuyang Wanyan,Xiaoshan Yang,Weiming Dong,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to address Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation challenges by decomposing modality-unique and shared features for better domain alignment and multimodal collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation (FSVDA) is challenging due to the multimodal nature of videos and variability in domain shifts across modalities, which impact generalization and feature integration.

Method: The proposed MC-LRD framework uses decomposers to separate modality-unique and shared features and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR) to regulate this process. Orthogonal decorrelation constraints and cross-domain activation consistency loss are incorporated to enhance diversity and alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: MC-LRD effectively addresses the challenges in Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation by enabling better domain alignment and modality collaboration, making it a promising solution for multimodal video tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenging task of Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation (FSVDA). The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features. To ensure efficient decomposition, we apply orthogonal decorrelation constraints separately to decomposers and subrouters, enhancing their diversity. Furthermore, we propose a cross-domain activation consistency loss to guarantee that target and source samples of the same category exhibit consistent activation preferences of the decomposers, thereby facilitating domain alignment. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address out-of-distribution (OOD) issues in autonomous driving caused by diverse outdoor scenes and limited training data coverage.

Method: DriveFlow uses Rectified Flow Adaptation with two frequency decomposition strategies for enhancing training data: High-Frequency Foreground Preservation and Dual-Frequency Background Optimization.

Result: Experiments show DriveFlow effectively improves model robustness and performance across OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: DriveFlow successfully enhances training data for autonomous driving and improves accuracy in 3D object detection using innovative frequency decomposition approaches.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, vision-centric 3D object detection recognizes and localizes 3D objects from RGB images. However, due to high annotation costs and diverse outdoor scenes, training data often fails to cover all possible test scenarios, known as the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. Training-free image editing offers a promising solution for improving model robustness by training data enhancement without any modifications to pre-trained diffusion models. Nevertheless, inversion-based methods often suffer from limited effectiveness and inherent inaccuracies, while recent rectified-flow-based approaches struggle to preserve objects with accurate 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose DriveFlow, a Rectified Flow Adaptation method for training data enhancement in autonomous driving based on pre-trained Text-to-Image flow models. Based on frequency decomposition, DriveFlow introduces two strategies to adapt noise-free editing paths derived from text-conditioned velocities. 1) High-Frequency Foreground Preservation: DriveFlow incorporates a high-frequency alignment loss for foreground to maintain precise 3D object geometry. 2) Dual-Frequency Background Optimization: DriveFlow also conducts dual-frequency optimization for background, balancing editing flexibility and semantic consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of DriveFlow, demonstrating comprehensive performance improvements on all categories across OOD scenarios.

*Ziqi Ni,Yuanzhi Liang,Rui Li,Yi Zhou,Haibing Huang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ViPO, an improvement to the GRPO pipeline for visual generative models by structuring scalar feedback into pixel-level advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO pipelines supervise generator alignment with human preferences using coarse scalar feedback, which fails to capture detailed spatial and temporal structure of visual outputs.

Method: ViPO introduces a Perceptual Structuring Module to transform coarse scalar feedback into spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, focusing optimization on perceptually important regions.

Result: ViPO outperforms traditional GRPO across image and video benchmarks, improves alignment with human preferences, and enhances generalization on out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: ViPO enhances GRPO pipelines with structured pixel-level feedback, improving precision in correcting artifacts and modeling perceptual cues, while remaining lightweight and adaptable.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for post-training visual generative models, with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) increasingly used to align generators with human preferences. However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on a single scalar reward per sample, treating each image or video as a holistic entity and ignoring the rich spatial and temporal structure of visual content. This coarse supervision hinders the correction of localized artifacts and the modeling of fine-grained perceptual cues. We introduce Visual Preference Policy Optimization (ViPO), a GRPO variant that lifts scalar feedback into structured, pixel-level advantages. ViPO employs a Perceptual Structuring Module that uses pretrained vision backbones to construct spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, redistributing optimization pressure toward perceptually important regions while preserving the stability of standard GRPO. Across both image and video benchmarks, ViPO consistently outperforms vanilla GRPO, improving in-domain alignment with human-preference rewards and enhancing generalization on out-of-domain evaluations. The method is architecture-agnostic, lightweight, and fully compatible with existing GRPO training pipelines, providing a more expressive and informative learning signal for visual generation.

*Lin Liu,Caiyan Jia,Guanyi Yu,Ziying Song,JunQiao Li,Feiyang Jia,Peiliang Wu,Xiaoshuai Hao,Yandan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GuideFlow introduces a novel planning framework for autonomous driving to address limitations of current solutions, by employing Constrained Flow Matching to produce diverse trajectories while embedding crucial constraints directly into the process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end imitative planners face trajectory mode collapse leading to poor variety, while generative planners require complex post-optimization to adhere to safety and physical constraints.

Method: GuideFlow explicitly models Constrained Flow Matching with explicit constraint integration, unifies it with Energy-Based Models for robust optimization, and uses aggressiveness parameters for trajectory style control.

Result: GuideFlow demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, achieving a notable EPDMS score of 43.0 on the challenging NavSim test split.

Conclusion: GuideFlow effectively addresses multimodal trajectory generation challenges in autonomous driving with a robust, constraint-embedded method, improving both diversity and safety compliance.

Abstract: Driving planning is a critical component of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, prevailing Imitative E2E Planners often suffer from multimodal trajectory mode collapse, failing to produce diverse trajectory proposals. Meanwhile, Generative E2E Planners struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization stage to refine their outputs. In this paper, we propose \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}}, a novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning signals. Our core contribution lies in directly enforcing explicit constraints within the flow matching generation process, rather than relying on implicit constraint encoding. Crucially, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} unifies the training of the flow matching with the Energy-Based Model (EBM) to enhance the model's autonomous optimization capability to robustly satisfy physical constraints. Secondly, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Extensive evaluations on major driving benchmarks (Bench2Drive, NuScenes, NavSim and ADV-NuScenes) validate the effectiveness of \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}}. Notably, on the NavSim test hard split (Navhard), \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} achieved SOTA with an EPDMS score of 43.0. The code will be released.

*Keyang Lu,Sifan Zhou,Hongbin Xu,Gang Xu,Zhifei Yang,Yikai Wang,Zhen Xiao,Jieyi Long,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Yo'City is a framework for generating personalized and unlimited 3D cities using top-down planning and large pretrained models, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of existing methods in generating boundless, personalized 3D cities for applications such as VR and digital twins.

Method: Yo'City employs a hierarchical planning structure (City-District-Grid), combines image synthesis with image-to-3D generation, and introduces user-interactive city expansion through spatially coherent optimization.

Result: The framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks assessing semantics, geometry, texture, and layout.

Conclusion: Yo'City offers a novel and effective approach to 3D city generation that excels in quality, adaptability, and scalability.

Abstract: Realistic 3D city generation is fundamental to a wide range of applications, including virtual reality and digital twins. However, most existing methods rely on training a single diffusion model, which limits their ability to generate personalized and boundless city-scale scenes. In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical "City-District-Grid" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a "produce-refine-evaluate" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Foresight Intelligence, a concept aiming to anticipate future events, and presents FSU-QA, a Visual Question-Answering dataset for evaluating this capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks tools and methodologies to study Foresight Intelligence, which is crucial for applications like autonomous driving.

Method: The authors developed the FSU-QA dataset to elicit and evaluate Foresight Intelligence and tested Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on foresight-oriented tasks.

Result: Experiments show that VLMs struggle with foresight tasks, but fine-tuning them on FSU-QA significantly improves their performance, even outperforming much larger models.

Conclusion: FSU-QA serves as a foundation for advancing models capable of anticipating and understanding future events, addressing gaps in current technology.

Abstract: In this work, we define Foresight Intelligence as the capability to anticipate and interpret future events-an ability essential for applications such as autonomous driving, yet largely overlooked by existing research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FSU-QA, a new Visual Question-Answering (VQA) dataset specifically designed to elicit and evaluate Foresight Intelligence. Using FSU-QA, we conduct the first comprehensive study of state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under foresight-oriented tasks, revealing that current models still struggle to reason about future situations. Beyond serving as a benchmark, FSU-QA also enables the assessment of world models by measuring the semantic coherence of their generated predictions, quantified through performance gains when VLMs are augmented with such outputs. Our experiments further demonstrate that FSU-QA can effectively enhance foresight reasoning: even small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA surpass much larger, advanced models by a substantial margin. Together, these findings position FSU-QA as a principled foundation for developing next-generation models capable of truly anticipating and understanding future events.

*Zhenghan Fang,Jian Zheng,Qiaozi Gao,Xiaofeng Gao,Jeremias Sulam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProxT2I, a text-to-image generative model using backward discretizations to improve sampling efficiency and quality, backed by a large human-image dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models for generation are slow and unstable due to forward discretization, which requires numerous sampling steps for good results.

Method: The researchers propose a backward discretization technique using conditional proximal operators along with reinforcement learning and policy optimization techniques.

Result: ProxT2I enhances sampling efficiency, aligns better with human preferences, and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models using lower computational resources and smaller model size.

Conclusion: This lightweight solution offers a robust and efficient alternative to existing text-to-image generation models while introducing a new, rich dataset for training and evaluation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generative modeling across a wide range of domains, including prompt-conditional generation. The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM) to enhance video-based embodied AI using fixed primitives, improving alignment, efficiency, and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges posed by large-scale embodied interaction data scarcity and the difficulty in achieving long-horizon video generation.

Method: Restrict video generation to short-horizon primitives, employing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and Start-Goal heatmap Guidance (SGG) for compositional tasks.

Result: PEWM improves alignment between language and robotic actions, reduces learning complexity, enhances data efficiency, lowers latency, and advances closed-loop control.

Conclusion: The framework bridges fine-grained interaction with high-level reasoning, promoting scalable and interpretable embodied intelligence.

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a \textit{"GPT moment"} in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: \textit{the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions}. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{Primitive Embodied World Models} (PEWM), which restricts video generation to fixed shorter horizons, our approach \textit{1) enables} fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, \textit{2) reduces} learning complexity, \textit{3) improves} data efficiency in embodied data collection, and \textit{4) decreases} inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.

### [341] [From Features to Reference Points: Lightweight and Adaptive Fusion for Cooperative Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18757)
*Yongqi Zhu,Morui Zhu,Qi Chen,Deyuan Qu,Song Fu,Qing Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefPtsFusion is a lightweight and sensor-independent framework for cooperative autonomous driving that reduces communication bandwidth by exchanging compact reference points instead of feature maps, maintaining stable perception performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cooperative autonomous driving methods create large communication burdens due to extensive feature maps sharing. There's a need for a lightweight system that ensures accuracy and reduces this communication overhead.

Method: RefPtsFusion exchanges compact reference points (positions, velocities, sizes) between vehicles instead of feature maps or query embeddings, alongside a selective Top-K query fusion process to ensure high-confidence data sharing.

Result: Experiments on the M3CAD dataset demonstrate that RefPtsFusion decreases communication bandwidth by five orders of magnitude (hundreds of MB/s to a few KB/s at 5 FPS) while maintaining stable perception performance.

Conclusion: RefPtsFusion proves to be a scalable, accurate, and robust framework for cooperative driving systems, offering significant communication cost reductions and consistent performance across heterogeneous models.

Abstract: We present RefPtsFusion, a lightweight and interpretable framework for cooperative autonomous driving. Instead of sharing large feature maps or query embeddings, vehicles exchange compact reference points, e.g., objects' positions, velocities, and size information. This approach shifts the focus from "what is seen" to "where to see", creating a sensor- and model-independent interface that works well across vehicles with heterogeneous perception models while greatly reducing communication bandwidth. To enhance the richness of shared information, we further develop a selective Top-K query fusion that selectively adds high-confidence queries from the sender. It thus achieves a strong balance between accuracy and communication cost. Experiments on the M3CAD dataset show that RefPtsFusion maintains stable perception performance while reducing communication overhead by five orders of magnitude, dropping from hundreds of MB/s to only a few KB/s at 5 FPS (frame per second), compared to traditional feature-level fusion methods. Extensive experiments also demonstrate RefPtsFusion's strong robustness and consistent transmission behavior, highlighting its potential for scalable, real-time cooperative driving systems.

*Xuanzhao Dong,Wenhui Zhu,Yujian Xiong,Xiwen Chen,Hao Wang,Xin Li,Jiajun Cheng,Zhipeng Wang,Shao Tang,Oana Dumitrascu,Yalin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Vessel-Aware Optimal Transport (VAOT), a method to enhance color fundus photography (CFP) images while preserving vascular structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variability in CFP image acquisition, such as illumination changes, often degrades image quality, making enhancement essential. Existing GAN-based methods distort clinically significant vascular structures.

Method: The proposed VAOT framework uses an optimal-transport objective with two structure-preserving regularizers: a skeleton-based loss for global vascular connectivity and an endpoint-aware loss for local termini stability.

Result: VAOT demonstrated superior performance on synthetic degradation benchmarks and downstream tasks like vessel and lesion segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: VAOT effectively enhances CFP images by reducing noise and preserving critical vascular structures, offering a promising tool for retinal disease diagnosis and monitoring.

Abstract: Color fundus photography (CFP) is central to diagnosing and monitoring retinal disease, yet its acquisition variability (e.g., illumination changes) often degrades image quality, which motivates robust enhancement methods. Unpaired enhancement pipelines are typically GAN-based, however, they can distort clinically critical vasculature, altering vessel topology and endpoint integrity. Motivated by these structural alterations, we propose Vessel-Aware Optimal Transport (\textbf{VAOT}), a framework that combines an optimal-transport objective with two structure-preserving regularizers: (i) a skeleton-based loss to maintain global vascular connectivity and (ii) an endpoint-aware loss to stabilize local termini. These constraints guide learning in the unpaired setting, reducing noise while preserving vessel structure. Experimental results on synthetic degradation benchmark and downstream evaluations in vessel and lesion segmentation demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods against several state-of-the art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for generating realistic garment textures by addressing challenges in non-isometric image-based texture generation, introducing a new dataset and refining multi-view predictions for high-quality texture outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of texture diversity in existing 3D garment meshes and existing methods' reliance on strict topological consistency or accurate mesh deformation.

Method: The paper constructs a 3D Garment Videos dataset with consistent geometry-material supervision, employs the Nano Banana tool for cross-topology texture generation, and introduces an iterative baking method using uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting.

Result: The proposed approach efficiently generates production-ready Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) textures, achieving reliable texturing across non-isometric image-geometry pairs.

Conclusion: The method enables industry-level garment design by generating versatile textures that align spatially and maintain high quality, addressing key challenges in texture generation for 3D garments.

Abstract: Existing industrial 3D garment meshes already cover most real-world clothing geometries, yet their texture diversity remains limited. To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a framework for unsupervised visual anomaly detection in multi-view images, emphasizing viewpoint-invariant representations and geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for anomaly detection, designed for single-view inputs, struggle to handle multi-view images due to inconsistent features and high false positives.

Method: The framework consists of the Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM) for feature alignment using homography, integrated into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM) for progressive alignment, complemented by a Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) for enhancing feature consistency.

Result: VSAD achieves state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection on RealIAD and MANTA datasets, showing robustness against viewpoint shifts and complex textures.

Conclusion: VSAD is effective in reducing false positives and improving feature alignment in multi-view anomaly detection, proving its robustness and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised visual anomaly detection from multi-view images presents a significant challenge: distinguishing genuine defects from benign appearance variations caused by viewpoint changes. Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes. Extensive experiments on the challenging RealIAD and MANTA datasets demonstrate that VSAD sets a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level visual anomaly proving its robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model for virtual try-on, achieving notable performance and efficiency improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and memory overheads of diffusion-based Dual UNet VTON models while maintaining high synthesis fidelity.

Method: The researchers developed Re-CatVTON by deriving hypotheses on learning context features through visualization/theoretical analysis, introducing a tailored classifier-free guidance strategy, and directly injecting ground-truth garment latents.

Result: Re-CatVTON outperforms its predecessor CatVTON and displays competitive metrics (FID, KID, LPIPS) while requiring less computation and memory compared to Dual UNet models like Leffa.

Conclusion: Re-CatVTON establishes an improved efficiency-performance trade-off, providing high-quality VTON results with reduced computational demand.

Abstract: Virtual Try-On (VTON) is the task of synthesizing an image of a person wearing a target garment, conditioned on a person image and a garment image. While diffusion-based VTON models featuring a Dual UNet architecture demonstrate superior fidelity compared to single UNet models, they incur substantial computational and memory overhead due to their heavy structure. In this study, through visualization analysis and theoretical analysis, we derived three hypotheses regarding the learning of context features to condition the denoising process. Based on these hypotheses, we developed Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model that achieves high performance. We further enhance the model by introducing a modified classifier-free guidance strategy tailored for VTON's spatial concatenation conditioning, and by directly injecting the ground-truth garment latent derived from the clean garment latent to prevent the accumulation of prediction error. The proposed Re-CatVTON significantly improves performance compared to its predecessor (CatVTON) and requires less computation and memory than the high-performance Dual UNet model, Leffa. Our results demonstrate improved FID, KID, and LPIPS scores, with only a marginal decrease in SSIM, establishing a new efficiency-performance trade-off for single UNet VTON models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConceptGuard, a system to detect and prevent unsafe content in multimodal video generation by identifying latent risks and suppressing unsafe concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address safety concerns in multimodal video generation, as harmful content can arise from the interaction of text and image prompts, presenting risks current methods fail to tackle.

Method: The authors propose ConceptGuard, which comprises a detection module using contrastive learning for identifying risks and a suppression mechanism for altering unsafe prompts during generation.

Result: ConceptGuard achieved state-of-the-art performance in detecting multimodal risks and generating safer videos, as demonstrated through experiments using novel benchmarks ConceptRisk and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V.

Conclusion: The system effectively enhances safety in multimodal video generation, providing a proactive and comprehensive approach to mitigating risks.

Abstract: Recent progress in video generative models has enabled the creation of high-quality videos from multimodal prompts that combine text and images. While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current streamline classification methods rely on geometric trajectory features and fail to differentiate functionally similar fiber tracts with identical pathways.

Method: The paper designs a novel network combining pretrained streamline trajectory analysis with an auxiliary fMRI signal processing of fiber endpoint regions.

Result: The proposed framework showcased superior performance in dividing corticospinal tract into its four somatotopic subdivisions through comparisons and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The dual-stream framework successfully merges anatomical and functional data to enhance tract classification and demonstrates its capability in improving tract parcellation tasks.

Abstract: Streamline classification is essential to identify anatomically meaningful white matter tracts from diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, current streamline classification methods rely primarily on the geometric features of the streamline trajectory, failing to distinguish between functionally distinct fiber tracts with similar pathways. To address this, we introduce a novel dual-stream streamline classification framework that jointly analyzes dMRI and functional MRI (fMRI) data to enhance the functional coherence of tract parcellation. We design a novel network that performs streamline classification using a pretrained backbone model for full streamline trajectories, while augmenting with an auxiliary network that processes fMRI signals from fiber endpoint regions. We demonstrate our method by parcellating the corticospinal tract (CST) into its four somatotopic subdivisions. Experimental results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate our approach's superior performance.

TL;DR: STCDiT is a video super-resolution framework leveraging a pre-trained video diffusion model to restore high-quality videos with structural and temporal fidelity, even under complex camera movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of maintaining temporal stability and structural fidelity in video super-resolution efforts, particularly for videos with complex camera motions.

Method: It introduces a motion-aware VAE reconstruction method, segmenting video clips based on motion uniformity, and uses anchor-frame guidance to incorporate structural information from anchor frames during generation.

Result: STCDiT achieves superior structural fidelity and temporal consistency compared to state-of-the-art video super-resolution methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively restores high-quality videos while addressing structural and temporal reconstruction challenges, proving its efficacy through extensive experimental validation.

Abstract: We present STCDiT, a video super-resolution framework built upon a pre-trained video diffusion model, aiming to restore structurally faithful and temporally stable videos from degraded inputs, even under complex camera motions. The main challenges lie in maintaining temporal stability during reconstruction and preserving structural fidelity during generation. To address these challenges, we first develop a motion-aware VAE reconstruction method that performs segment-wise reconstruction, with each segment clip exhibiting uniform motion characteristic, thereby effectively handling videos with complex camera motions. Moreover, we observe that the first-frame latent extracted by the VAE encoder in each clip, termed the anchor-frame latent, remains unaffected by temporal compression and retains richer spatial structural information than subsequent frame latents. We further develop an anchor-frame guidance approach that leverages structural information from anchor frames to constrain the generation process and improve structural fidelity of video features. Coupling these two designs enables the video diffusion model to achieve high-quality video super-resolution. Extensive experiments show that STCDiT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of structural fidelity and temporal consistency.

Result: Findings include insights on positive and negative transfer, grouping tasks by their mutual influence, and organizing tasks into personas. PGF aids in identifying data selection for efficient training.

Conclusion: This study offers actionable guidance for improving VLMs by managing task transferability and training efficiency while balancing positive and negative transfer risks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well on multimodal benchmarks but lag behind humans and specialized models on visual perception tasks like depth estimation or object counting. Finetuning on one task can unpredictably affect performance on others, making task-specific finetuning challenging. In this paper, we address this challenge through a systematic study of task transferability. We examine how finetuning a VLM on one perception task affects its zero-shot performance on others. To quantify these effects, we introduce Perfection Gap Factor (PGF), a metric that captures both the breadth and magnitude of transfer. Using three open-weight VLMs evaluated across 13 perception tasks, we construct a task-transfer graph that reveals previously unobserved relationships among perception tasks. Our analysis uncovers patterns of positive and negative transfer, identifies groups of tasks that mutually influence each other, organizes tasks into personas based on their transfer behavior and demonstrates how PGF can guide data selection for more efficient training. These findings highlight both opportunities for positive transfer and risks of negative interference, offering actionable guidance for advancing VLMs.

*Shiyi Mu,Zichong Gu,Zhiqi Ai,Anqi Liu,Yilin Gao,Shugong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoDETR introduces an efficient stereo 3D object detection framework, combining the strengths of stereo and monocular approaches for improved speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stereo 3D detection methods offer better accuracy than monocular ones but suffer from high computational costs and slow inference speeds, motivating the need for an efficient solution.

Method: The paper proposes StereoDETR, a framework with two branches: a monocular DETR branch for scale, orientation, and sampling predictions, and a stereo branch for depth map predictions. These branches are linked using a differentiable depth sampling strategy and a constrained supervision method for occlusion handling.

Result: StereoDETR achieves real-time inference and sets new state-of-the-art results on the KITTI benchmark for pedestrian and cyclist detection, with competitive accuracy and faster speeds than monocular methods.

Conclusion: StereoDETR demonstrates that stereo-based methods can achieve both high accuracy and real-time performance, overcoming limitations of prior approaches and advancing 3D object detection research.

Abstract: Compared to monocular 3D object detection, stereo-based 3D methods offer significantly higher accuracy but still suffer from high computational overhead and latency. The state-of-the-art stereo 3D detection method achieves twice the accuracy of monocular approaches, yet its inference speed is only half as fast. In this paper, we propose StereoDETR, an efficient stereo 3D object detection framework based on DETR. StereoDETR consists of two branches: a monocular DETR branch and a stereo branch. The DETR branch is built upon 2D DETR with additional channels for predicting object scale, orientation, and sampling points. The stereo branch leverages low-cost multi-scale disparity features to predict object-level depth maps. These two branches are coupled solely through a differentiable depth sampling strategy. To handle occlusion, we introduce a constrained supervision strategy for sampling points without requiring extra annotations. StereoDETR achieves real-time inference and is the first stereo-based method to surpass monocular approaches in speed. It also achieves competitive accuracy on the public KITTI benchmark, setting new state-of-the-art results on pedestrian and cyclist subsets.

### [351] [Scale What Counts, Mask What Matters: Evaluating Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Wi-Fi Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18792)
*Cheng Jiang,Yihe Yan,Yanxiang Wang,Chun Tung Chou,Wen Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of robustness in Wi-Fi sensing across different domains due to domain shifts and fragmented datasets. It proposes leveraging a foundation model with Masked Autoencoding (MAE) on the largest heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI dataset for cross-domain improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi sensing struggles to generalize across varying environments, hardware, and users, limiting its practical use. The motivation is to overcome the domain shift problem and improve generalization for real-world deployment.

Method: The authors apply Masked Autoencoding (MAE) for pretraining on a large, diverse collection of Wi-Fi CSI datasets, with 1.3 million samples from 14 datasets across different devices and frequency bands. They systematically analyze the effects of data diversity and model capacity on cross-domain performance.

Result: The study reveals that increasing data diversity and scale leads to log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance. However, model capacity provides only marginal improvement with the current dataset size. Pretraining improves accuracy in cross-domain tasks, with gains ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%.

Conclusion: Large-scale, diverse data is the key to improving domain generalization in Wi-Fi sensing, while increasing model size yields diminishing returns. These findings guide the design of future Wi-Fi sensing systems for robust real-world applications.

Abstract: While Wi-Fi sensing offers a compelling, privacy-preserving alternative to cameras, its practical utility has been fundamentally undermined by a lack of robustness across domains. Models trained in one setup fail to generalize to new environments, hardware, or users, a critical "domain shift" problem exacerbated by modest, fragmented public datasets. We shift from this limited paradigm and apply a foundation model approach, leveraging Masked Autoencoding (MAE) style pretraining on the largest and most heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI datasets collection assembled to date. Our study pretrains and evaluates models on over 1.3 million samples extracted from 14 datasets, collected using 4 distinct devices across the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and bandwidths from 20 to 160 MHz. Our large-scale evaluation is the first to systematically disentangle the impacts of data diversity versus model capacity on cross-domain performance. The results establish scaling trends on Wi-Fi CSI sensing. First, our experiments show log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, suggesting that data scale and diversity are key to domain generalization. Second, based on the current data volume, larger model can only provide marginal gains for cross-domain performance, indicating that data, rather than model capacity, is the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization. Finally, we conduct a series of cross-domain evaluations on human activity recognition, human gesture recognition and user identification tasks. The results show that the large-scale pretraining improves cross-domain accuracy ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%, compared to the supervised learning baseline. Overall, our findings provide insightful direction for designing future Wi-Fi sensing systems that can eventually be robust enough for real-world deployment.

### [352] [PartDiffuser: Part-wise 3D Mesh Generation via Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18801)
*Yichen Yang,Hong Li,Haodong Zhu,Linin Yang,Guojun Lei,Sheng Xu,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PartDiffuser, a semi-autoregressive diffusion model for generating detailed artist-designed 3D meshes with strong global and local fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive methods struggle with balancing global structural consistency and local details, and they also suffer from error accumulation during 3D mesh generation.

Method: PartDiffuser performs semantic segmentation of the mesh and generates meshes in a 'part-wise' manner, using autoregression for global topology and parallel discrete diffusion within each part for high-detail features. It uses the DiT architecture with part-aware cross-attention and point clouds for hierarchical geometric context.

Result: PartDiffuser significantly improves upon state-of-the-art methods in generating 3D meshes with rich detail and precision, suitable for real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully balances global and high-detail local generation tasks, overcoming limitations of traditional autoregressive approaches, presenting a new benchmark for 3D mesh generation.

Abstract: Existing autoregressive (AR) methods for generating artist-designed meshes struggle to balance global structural consistency with high-fidelity local details, and are susceptible to error accumulation. To address this, we propose PartDiffuser, a novel semi-autoregressive diffusion framework for point-cloud-to-mesh generation. The method first performs semantic segmentation on the mesh and then operates in a "part-wise" manner: it employs autoregression between parts to ensure global topology, while utilizing a parallel discrete diffusion process within each semantic part to precisely reconstruct high-frequency geometric features. PartDiffuser is based on the DiT architecture and introduces a part-aware cross-attention mechanism, using point clouds as hierarchical geometric conditioning to dynamically control the generation process, thereby effectively decoupling the global and local generation tasks. Experiments demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in generating 3D meshes with rich detail, exhibiting exceptional detail representation suitable for real-world applications.

### [353] [TPG-INR: Target Prior-Guided Implicit 3D CT Reconstruction for Enhanced Sparse-view Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18806)
*Qinglei Cao,Ziyao Tang,Xiaoqin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for 3D CT reconstruction using anatomical priors derived from projection data. This approach significantly improves reconstruction quality and learning efficiency, especially under sparse-view conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D CT reconstruction methods often fail to incorporate anatomical priors effectively, limiting precision and efficiency in sparse-view scenarios.

Method: The framework incorporates 'target priors' derived from projection data, alongside a CUDA-based algorithm for rapid prior estimation. Positional and structural encoding are used for voxel-wise implicit reconstruction.

Result: The proposed method outperforms leading models, improving learning speed by 10 times and achieving significant PSNR improvements of up to 5.70 dB on sparse-view datasets.

Conclusion: By leveraging anatomical priors for implicit learning, the framework enhances both the efficiency and quality of 3D CT reconstruction, setting a new standard for performance in sparse-view scenarios.

Abstract: X-ray imaging, based on penetration, enables detailed visualization of internal structures. Building on this capability, existing implicit 3D reconstruction methods have adapted the NeRF model and its variants for internal CT reconstruction. However, these approaches often neglect the significance of objects' anatomical priors for implicit learning, limiting both reconstruction precision and learning efficiency, particularly in ultra-sparse view scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D CT reconstruction framework that employs a 'target prior' derived from the object's projection data to enhance implicit learning. Our approach integrates positional and structural encoding to facilitate voxel-wise implicit reconstruction, utilizing the target prior to guide voxel sampling and enrich structural encoding. This dual strategy significantly boosts both learning efficiency and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we introduce a CUDA-based algorithm for rapid estimation of high-quality 3D target priors from sparse-view projections. Experiments utilizing projection data from a complex abdominal dataset demonstrate that the proposed model substantially enhances learning efficiency, outperforming the current leading model, NAF, by a factor of ten. In terms of reconstruction quality, it also exceeds the most accurate model, NeRP, achieving PSNR improvements of 3.57 dB, 5.42 dB, and 5.70 dB with 10, 20, and 30 projections, respectively.

*Yuqiu Jiang,Xiaozhen Qiao,Tianyu Mei,Haojian Huang,Yifan Chen,Ye Zheng,Zhe Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses HOI detection by introducing the Adaptive Diversity Cache (ADC), a training-free module that helps mitigate long-tail bias and improve detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the computational overhead and scalability limitations in HOI detection, especially in rare interactions within long-tailed scenarios.

Method: The ADC module creates class-specific caches with high-confidence diverse feature representations and uses frequency-aware adaptation to enhance rare category predictions without extra training or fine-tuning.

Result: ADC boosts HOI detector performance, achieving up to +8.57% mAP improvement on rare categories and +4.39% on overall datasets like HICO-DET and V-COCO.

Conclusion: ADC effectively reduces long-tail bias, improves HOI detection performance, and is computationally efficient due to its training-free plug-and-play design.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, empowering machines to comprehend human-object relationships in diverse real-world scenarios. Recent advances in VLMs have significantly improved HOI detection by leveraging rich cross-modal representations. However, most existing VLM-based approaches rely heavily on additional training or prompt tuning, resulting in substantial computational overhead and limited scalability, particularly in long-tailed scenarios where rare interactions are severely underrepresented. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Diversity Cache (ADC) module, a novel training-free and plug-and-play mechanism designed to mitigate long-tail bias in HOI detection. ADC constructs class-specific caches that accumulate high-confidence and diverse feature representations during inference. The method incorporates frequency-aware cache adaptation that favors rare categories and is designed to enable robust prediction calibration without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show that ADC consistently improves existing HOI detectors, achieving up to +8.57\% mAP gain on rare categories and +4.39\% on the full dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating long-tail bias while preserving overall performance.

*Jiawei Hou,Shenghao Zhang,Can Wang,Zheng Gu,Yonggen Ling,Taiping Zeng,Xiangyang Xue,Jingbo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses 4D object detection in streaming video, proposing a new dataset (DA4D) and an end-to-end framework (DetAny4D) to improve accuracy and temporal stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D object detection methods face issues like lack of temporal consistency and error propagation due to complex pipelines, exacerbated by the absence of large-scale datasets with annotations.

Method: It introduces DA4D dataset containing over 280k sequences with diverse bounding box annotations. DetAny4D framework is proposed, leveraging multi-modal foundational models and a geometry-aware spatiotemporal decoder combined with multi-task learning for consistent detection.

Result: DetAny4D demonstrates improved detection accuracy and significantly reduces jitter/inconsistency across sequences in 4D object detection.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and framework effectively address challenges in 4D object detection, enhancing both accuracy and temporal reliability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Reliable 4D object detection, which refers to 3D object detection in streaming video, is crucial for perceiving and understanding the real world. Existing open-set 4D object detection methods typically make predictions on a frame-by-frame basis without modeling temporal consistency, or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines that are prone to error propagation across cascaded stages. Progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets that capture continuous reliable 3D bounding box (b-box) annotations. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce DA4D, a large-scale 4D detection dataset containing over 280k sequences with high-quality b-box annotations collected under diverse conditions. Building on DA4D, we propose DetAny4D, an open-set end-to-end framework that predicts 3D b-boxes directly from sequential inputs. DetAny4D fuses multi-modal features from pre-trained foundational models and designs a geometry-aware spatiotemporal decoder to effectively capture both spatial and temporal dynamics. Furthermore, it adopts a multi-task learning architecture coupled with a dedicated training strategy to maintain global consistency across sequences of varying lengths. Extensive experiments show that DetAny4D achieves competitive detection accuracy and significantly improves temporal stability, effectively addressing long-standing issues of jitter and inconsistency in 4D object detection. Data and code will be released upon acceptance.

### [356] [SupLID: Geometrical Guidance for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18816)
*Nimeshika Udayangani,Sarah Erfani,Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SupLID introduces a novel approach for pixel-level Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in semantic segmentation by leveraging geometrical cues and the local structure of high-dimensional data using Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality, significantly improving classifier-derived OOD scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for pixel-level OOD detection arises in applications like autonomous driving where identifying anomalous regions precisely is crucial, overcoming the limitations of image-level OOD methods, especially overconfidence issues.

Method: SupLID framework employs Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to exploit geometrical structures, builds a geometrical coreset to capture the intrinsic subspace structure, and computes OOD scores at the superpixel level to enhance efficiency and performance.

Result: SupLID boosts OOD detection capabilities by complementing classifier confidence methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in metrics like AUR, FPR, and AUP.

Conclusion: By integrating geometrical cues and designing a post-hoc scoring method, SupLID enhances OOD detection for semantic segmentation models, making it effective, efficient, and deployable across classifiers.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in semantic segmentation aims to localize anomalous regions at the pixel level, advancing beyond traditional image-level OOD techniques to better suit real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Recent literature has successfully explored the adaptation of commonly used image-level OOD methods--primarily based on classifier-derived confidence scores (e.g., energy or entropy)--for this pixel-precise task. However, these methods inherit a set of limitations, including vulnerability to overconfidence. In this work, we introduce SupLID, a novel framework that effectively guides classifier-derived OOD scores by exploiting the geometrical structure of the underlying semantic space, particularly using Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). While LID effectively characterizes the local structure of high-dimensional data by analyzing distance distributions, its direct application at the pixel level remains challenging. To overcome this, SupLID constructs a geometrical coreset that captures the intrinsic structure of the in-distribution (ID) subspace. It then computes OOD scores at the superpixel level, enabling both efficient real-time inference and improved spatial smoothness. We demonstrate that geometrical cues derived from SupLID serve as a complementary signal to traditional classifier confidence, enhancing the model's ability to detect diverse OOD scenarios. Designed as a post-hoc scoring method, SupLID can be seamlessly integrated with any semantic segmentation classifier at deployment time. Our results demonstrate that SupLID significantly enhances existing classifier-based OOD scores, achieving state-of-the-art performance across key evaluation metrics, including AUR, FPR, and AUP.

*Siyuan Wei,Chunjie Wang,Xiao Liu,Xiaosheng Yan,Zhishan Zhou,Rui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fully automated pipeline that generates high-quality 3D scene-dialogue datasets, addressing key ambiguities and yielding the Disc3D dataset with over 2 million samples for improved 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this research is the lack of large-scale, high-quality 3D scene-dialogue datasets, which hinders the development of 3D MLLMs compared to their 2D counterparts. Challenges such as viewpoint ambiguity and object referring ambiguity add to the dataset generation difficulties.

Method: The authors propose an automated pipeline with four stages: (1) collecting meta-annotations like object and scene captions, (2) constructing a scene graph that corrects object relations, (3) creating discriminative object descriptions, and (4) generating dialogues for diverse tasks. This pipeline relies on rules, 2D MLLMs, and LLMs for scalable and controllable data generation without human intervention.

Result: The pipeline generates Disc3D, a dataset with over 2 million samples across 25K hybrid 3D scenes. These samples cover various tasks, including captioning, visual grounding, and object-centric QA. Experiments show significant performance improvements using Disc3D on public benchmarks and custom Disc3D-QA tasks.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a cost-efficient and automated solution to produce unambiguous and scalable 3D scene-dialogue datasets, effectively addressing existing ambiguities. The proposed Disc3D dataset demonstrates potential for advancing research in 3D MLLMs, with code and data made publicly available to encourage further exploration.

Abstract: 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still lag behind their 2D peers, largely because large-scale, high-quality 3D scene-dialogue datasets remain scarce. Prior efforts hinge on expensive human annotation and leave two key ambiguities unresolved: viewpoint ambiguity, where spatial language presumes unknown camera poses, and object referring ambiguity, where non-exclusive descriptions blur the line between targets and distractors. We therefore present a fully automated pipeline that converts raw 3D scans into unambiguous, high-quality dialogue data at a fraction of the previous cost. By synergizing rule-based constraints with 2D MLLMs and LLMs, the pipeline enables controllable, scalable generation without human intervention. The pipeline comprises four stages: (1) meta-annotation collection harvesting object-, frame-, and scene-level captions, (2) scene graph construction with relation correction to capture proximal object relations, (3) discriminative object referring that generates exclusive and compact descriptions, and (4) multi-task data generation synthesizing diverse dialogues. Our pipeline systematically mitigates inherent flaws in source datasets and produces the final Disc3D dataset, over 2 million samples in 25K hybrid 3D scenes, spanning scene, view, and object captioning, visual grounding, and five object-centric QA tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with Disc3D yields consistent, significant improvements on both public benchmarks and our multifaceted Disc3D-QA tasks. Code, data, and models will be publicly available.

*Zhennan Chen,Junwei Zhu,Xu Chen,Jiangning Zhang,Xiaobin Hu,Hanzhen Zhao,Chengjie Wang,Jian Yang,Ying Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiP, an efficient pixel space diffusion model that addresses quality-efficiency trade-offs in high-resolution generation, offering low computational cost and high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models either compromise generation quality for efficiency or are computationally expensive for high-resolution tasks, prompting the need for a balanced approach.

Method: The proposed DiP uses a two-stage decoupled framework: a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for efficient global structure creation and a lightweight Patch Detailer Head for detailed restoration, without relying on VAEs.

Result: DiP achieves up to 10x faster inference speeds while only increasing parameters by 0.3%, and secures a 1.90 FID score on ImageNet 256x256.

Conclusion: DiP surpasses traditional methods in computational efficiency and generation quality, presenting a practical and scalable solution for pixel space diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models face a fundamental trade-off between generation quality and computational efficiency. Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) offer an efficient solution but suffer from potential information loss and non-end-to-end training. In contrast, existing pixel space models bypass VAEs but are computationally prohibitive for high-resolution synthesis. To resolve this dilemma, we propose DiP, an efficient pixel space diffusion framework. DiP decouples generation into a global and a local stage: a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone operates on large patches for efficient global structure construction, while a co-trained lightweight Patch Detailer Head leverages contextual features to restore fine-grained local details. This synergistic design achieves computational efficiency comparable to LDMs without relying on a VAE. DiP is accomplished with up to 10$\times$ faster inference speeds than previous method while increasing the total number of parameters by only 0.3%, and achieves an 1.90 FID score on ImageNet 256$\times$256.

TL;DR: VideoPerceiver is a new video-language model enhancing fine-grained perception for better understanding brief actions and rare events in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of video multimodal large language models (VMLLMs) in reasoning about brief actions and rare transient events in videos.

Method: VideoPerceiver uses a two-stage training framework: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with 'key-information-missing' videos and reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel relative reward mechanism to improve model recovery of precise action details.

Result: Experiments demonstrate VideoPerceiver significantly surpasses existing VMLLMs in benchmarks for fine-grained action understanding and rare event captioning, while retaining strong performance on standard tasks.

Conclusion: The study introduces a model and training methodology that improve video-language models' sensitivity to fine-grained and transient events, advancing video understanding.

Abstract: We propose VideoPerceiver, a novel video multimodal large language model (VMLLM) that enhances fine-grained perception in video understanding, addressing VMLLMs' limited ability to reason about brief actions in short clips or rare transient events in long videos. VideoPerceiver adopts a two-stage training framework. During supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we construct "key-information-missing" videos by extracting event-action keywords from captions, identifying corresponding key frames, and replacing them with adjacent frames. We jointly encode original and modified video tokens with text tokens, aligning intermediate visual representations with keywords via an auxiliary contrastive loss to enhance sensitivity to fine-grained motion cues. In reinforcement learning (RL), both video variants are fed into the model to generate descriptions, and a novel relative reward ensures responses from complete videos outperform those from degraded inputs, explicitly training the model to recover temporally precise action details. We also curate a dataset of 80,000 videos with fine-grained actions and transient events. Experiments show VideoPerceiver substantially outperforms state-of-the-art VMLLMs on fine-grained action understanding and rare event captioning benchmarks, while maintaining strong performance on standard tasks. By prioritizing task-relevant visual features, our work redefines video-language model training for fine-grained perception.

Motivation: To provide a holistic and explainable evaluation for AI-generated video quality, addressing the lack of detailed and interpretable assessments in existing research.

Method: They developed a dataset annotated across visual quality, dynamic quality, and text-video alignment, combined with a SlowFast framework for processing frames. Training involves Supervised Fine-Tuning, Grouped Relative Policy Optimization, and stability refinement.

Result: The proposed model surpasses benchmark methods in video quality prediction and provides interpretable justifications for its assessments.

Conclusion: The Q-Save dataset and model contribute to explainable assessment in generative video research, promoting trustworthy AI and multimodal generation. Code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: We present Q-Save, a new benchmark dataset and model for holistic and explainable evaluation of AI-generated video (AIGV) quality. The dataset contains near 10000 videos, each annotated with a scalar mean opinion score (MOS) and fine-grained attribution labels along three core dimensions: visual quality, dynamic quality, and text-video alignment. These multi-aspect annotations enable both accurate quality assessment and interpretable reasoning behind the scores. To leverage this data, we propose a unified evaluation model that jointly performs quality scoring and attribution-based explanation. The model adopts the SlowFast framework to distinguish between fast frames and slow frames - slow frames are processed with high resolution while fast frames use low resolution, balancing evaluation accuracy and computational efficiency. For training, we use data formatted in Chain-of-Thought (COT) style and employ a multi-stage strategy: we first conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), then further enhance the model with Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and finally perform SFT again to improve model stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality prediction while also providing human-aligned, interpretable justifications. Our dataset and model establish a strong foundation for explainable evaluation in generative video research, contributing to the development of multimodal generation and trustworthy AI. Code and dataset will be released upon publication.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance model compression by addressing a limitation in traditional knowledge distillation methods, which do not account for varying confidence levels in teacher predictions.

Method: The paper proposes using an uncertainty-aware strategy to guide learning, combined with a peer-learning mechanism between two heterogeneous student models (ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2).

Result: The method achieves 83.84% top-1 accuracy for ResNet-18 and 81.46% for MobileNetV2 on ImageNet-100, outperforming traditional methods by 2.04% and 0.92%, respectively.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that incorporating uncertainty and peer learning significantly improves the efficacy of knowledge distillation for model compression.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for model compression, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large teacher networks to compact student models. However, traditional knowledge distillation methods treat all teacher predictions equally, regardless of the teacher's confidence in those predictions. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware dual-student knowledge distillation framework that leverages teacher prediction uncertainty to selectively guide student learning. We introduce a peer-learning mechanism where two heterogeneous student architectures, specifically ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2, learn collaboratively from both the teacher network and each other. Experimental results on ImageNet-100 demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline knowledge distillation methods, with ResNet-18 achieving 83.84\% top-1 accuracy and MobileNetV2 achieving 81.46\% top-1 accuracy, representing improvements of 2.04\% and 0.92\% respectively over traditional single-student distillation approaches.

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid model combining deep learning and swarm intelligence techniques to enhance the detection of anxiety disorders using wearable-sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of identifying anxiety disorders, such as clinical interviews, are time-intensive and subjective, necessitating more consistent, automated approaches.

Method: The study incorporates deep learning and swarm intelligence methods, such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization, to analyze multimodal datasets and optimize feature selection and hyperparameters.

Result: The hybrid framework significantly outperforms solely using deep learning, improving accuracy and generalization in detecting anxiety across diverse individuals.

Conclusion: Integrating metaheuristic optimization with deep learning offers an effective and scalable solution for automated, objective anxiety disorder assessment.

Abstract: Despite being among the most common psychological disorders, anxiety-related conditions are still primarily identified through subjective assessments, such as clinical interviews and self-evaluation questionnaires. These conventional methods often require significant time and may vary depending on the evaluator. However, the emergence of advanced artificial intelligence techniques has created new opportunities for detecting anxiety in a more consistent and automated manner. To address the limitations of traditional approaches, this study introduces a comprehensive model that integrates deep learning architectures with optimization strategies inspired by swarm intelligence. Using multimodal and wearable-sensor datasets, the framework analyzes physiological, emotional, and behavioral signals. Swarm intelligence techniques including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization are incorporated to refine the feature space and optimize hyperparameters. Meanwhile, deep learning components are tasked with deriving layered and discriminative representations from sequential, multi-source inputs. Our evaluation shows that the fusion of these two computational paradigms significantly enhances detection performance compared with using deep networks alone. The hybrid model achieves notable improvements in accuracy and demonstrates stronger generalization across various individuals. Overall, the results highlight the potential of combining metaheuristic optimization with deep learning to develop scalable, objective, and clinically meaningful solutions for assessing anxiety disorders

TL;DR: The paper presents VideoCompressa, a novel framework that significantly reduces the data and computational demands of video data synthesis by focusing on compressing only the most informative frames into compact latent codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing computational and storage constraints in scaling video understanding models and to resolve the inefficiencies caused by frame-level redundancy in video data.

Method: VideoCompressa uses a keyframe selector (implemented via a lightweight ConvNet with Gumbel-Softmax sampling) to identify important frames, and a pretrained Variational Autoencoder to compress these frames into efficient latent representations. These compressed representations are optimized together for task performance.

Result: VideoCompressa achieves significant improvements in data efficiency, surpassing traditional full-data training by up to 2.34% on UCF101, while using just 0.13% of the original data. It also achieves comparable performance on HMDB51 using only 0.41% of the training data, with substantial speed advantages.

Conclusion: VideoCompressa demonstrates that focusing on frame-level redundancy and optimizing dynamic latent compression can drastically improve scalability and efficiency of video understanding tasks, without compromising task performance.

Abstract: The scalability of video understanding models is increasingly limited by the prohibitive storage and computational costs of large-scale video datasets. While data synthesis has improved data efficiency in the image domain, its extension to video remains challenging due to pervasive temporal redundancy and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we uncover a critical insight: the primary source of inefficiency in video datasets is not inter-sample redundancy, but intra-sample frame-level redundancy. To leverage this insight, we introduce VideoCompressa, a novel framework for video data synthesis that reframes the problem as dynamic latent compression. Specifically, VideoCompressa jointly optimizes a differentiable keyframe selector-implemented as a lightweight ConvNet with Gumbel-Softmax sampling-to identify the most informative frames, and a pretrained, frozen Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress these frames into compact, semantically rich latent codes. These latent representations are then fed into a compression network, enabling end-to-end backpropagation. Crucially, the keyframe selector and synthetic latent codes are co-optimized to maximize retention of task-relevant information. Experiments show that our method achieves unprecedented data efficiency: on UCF101 with ConvNets, VideoCompressa surpasses full-data training by 2.34\% points using only 0.13\% of the original data, with over 5800x speedup compared to traditional synthesis method. Moreover, when fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B-VL on HMDB51, VideoCompressa matches full-data performance using just 0.41\% of the training data-outperforming zero-shot baseline by 10.61\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses shortcomings in flow matching's sampling efficiency in visual generation by introducing FlowSteer, enhancing ReFlow-based distillation to better align student models with teacher generation trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the sampling inefficiency bottleneck in flow models, particularly focusing on the suboptimal performance of ReFlow in practical applications.

Method: The authors propose FlowSteer, which leverages Online Trajectory Alignment (OTA) and an adversarial distillation objective to better align student models with teacher trajectories. It also fixes a flaw in the FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler to enhance few-step inference.

Result: Experiments on SD3 demonstrate the efficacy and improvements of the proposed FlowSteer method over existing techniques.

Conclusion: FlowSteer resolves critical issues in ReFlow-based distillation, enhancing its practical performance and offering a significant improvement in sampling efficiency for visual generation.

Abstract: With the success of flow matching in visual generation, sampling efficiency remains a critical bottleneck for its practical application. Among flow models' accelerating methods, ReFlow has been somehow overlooked although it has theoretical consistency with flow matching. This is primarily due to its suboptimal performance in practical scenarios compared to consistency distillation and score distillation. In this work, we investigate this issue within the ReFlow framework and propose FlowSteer, a method unlocks the potential of ReFlow-based distillation by guiding the student along teacher's authentic generation trajectories. We first identify that Piecewised ReFlow's performance is hampered by a critical distribution mismatch during the training and propose Online Trajectory Alignment(OTA) to resolve it. Then, we introduce a adversarial distillation objective applied directly on the ODE trajectory, improving the student's adherence to the teacher's generation trajectory. Furthermore, we find and fix a previously undiscovered flaw in the widely-used FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler that largely degrades few-step inference quality. Our experiment result on SD3 demonstrates our method's efficacy.

### [365] [FVAR: Visual Autoregressive Modeling via Next Focus Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18838)
*Xiaofan Li,Chenming Wu,Yanpeng Sun,Jiaming Zhou,Delin Qu,Yansong Qu,Weihao Bo,Haibao Yu,Dingkang Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FVAR, a visual autoregressive model that reduces aliasing artifacts and improves fine detail preservation by shifting the focus from downsampling to progressive blur reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in conventional visual autoregressive models where uniform scale downsampling causes aliasing artifacts, degrading image quality.

Method: The method involves three innovations: next-focus prediction paradigm, progressive defocusing pyramid construction using PSF kernels, and high-frequency residual learning via a teacher network.

Result: The proposed FVAR approach significantly reduces aliasing artifacts, enhances fine details in generated images, and improves text readability, tested on ImageNet data.

Conclusion: FVAR resolves aliasing issues present in traditional methods, improves image clarity, and is fully compatible with existing frameworks.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models achieve remarkable generation quality through next-scale predictions across multi-scale token pyramids. However, the conventional method uses uniform scale downsampling to build these pyramids, leading to aliasing artifacts that compromise fine details and introduce unwanted jaggies and moiré patterns. To tackle this issue, we present \textbf{FVAR}, which reframes the paradigm from \emph{next-scale prediction} to \emph{next-focus prediction}, mimicking the natural process of camera focusing from blur to clarity. Our approach introduces three key innovations: \textbf{1) Next-Focus Prediction Paradigm} that transforms multi-scale autoregression by progressively reducing blur rather than simply downsampling; \textbf{2) Progressive Refocusing Pyramid Construction} that uses physics-consistent defocus kernels to build clean, alias-free multi-scale representations; and \textbf{3) High-Frequency Residual Learning} that employs a specialized residual teacher network to effectively incorporate alias information during training while maintaining deployment simplicity. Specifically, we construct optical low-pass views using defocus point spread function (PSF) kernels with decreasing radius, creating smooth blur-to-clarity transitions that eliminate aliasing at its source. To further enhance detail generation, we introduce a High-Frequency Residual Teacher that learns from both clean structure and alias residuals, distilling this knowledge to a vanilla VAR deployment network for seamless inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FVAR substantially reduces aliasing artifacts, improves fine detail preservation, and enhances text readability, achieving superior performance with perfect compatibility to existing VAR frameworks.

*Yasiru Laksara,Uthayasanker Thayasivam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the lack of predictive confidence in deep learning models for clinical diagnostics, introducing a Deep Ensemble architecture to enhance reliability and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the deterministic nature of deep learning models like CheXNet, which limits their use in clinical settings due to unreliable measures of confidence.

Method: The study transitioned from Monte Carlo Dropout to a 9-member Deep Ensemble for diagnosing 14 thoracic diseases using the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, focusing on improved calibration and uncertainty quantification.

Result: The Deep Ensemble achieved superior performance and reliability, including an AUROC of 0.8559, F1 Score of 0.3857, and enhanced calibration metrics (ECE: 0.0728, NLL: 0.1916).

Conclusion: The Deep Ensemble provides a trustworthy and explainable diagnostic platform, enabling clinical decision support with robust uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: The utility of deep learning models, such as CheXNet, in high stakes clinical settings is fundamentally constrained by their purely deterministic nature, failing to provide reliable measures of predictive confidence. This project addresses this critical gap by integrating robust Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) into a high performance diagnostic platform for 14 common thoracic diseases on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset. Initial architectural development failed to stabilize performance and calibration using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), yielding an unacceptable Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.7588. This technical failure necessitated a rigorous architectural pivot to a high diversity, 9-member Deep Ensemble (DE). This resulting DE successfully stabilized performance and delivered superior reliability, achieving a State-of-the-Art (SOTA) average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.8559 and an average F1 Score of 0.3857. Crucially, the DE demonstrated superior calibration (Mean ECE of 0.0728 and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) of 0.1916) and enabled the reliable decomposition of total uncertainty into its Aleatoric (irreducible data noise) and Epistemic (reducible model knowledge) components, with a mean Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) of 0.0240. These results establish the Deep Ensemble as a trustworthy and explainable platform, transforming the model from a probabilistic tool into a reliable clinical decision support system.

*Ishmam Tashdeed,Md. Atiqur Rahman,Sabrina Islam,Md. Azam Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedOAP, a personalized federated learning approach for tumor segmentation using cross-attention and boundary-aware loss, demonstrating superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the strengths of personalized federated learning, existing methods often fail to exploit shared features across client datasets, especially in heterogeneous medical data like organ-specific segmentation tasks.

Method: FedOAP incorporates decoupled cross-attention (DCA) for inter-organ feature modeling and perturbed boundary loss (PBL) for enhancing boundary precision in segmentation.

Result: Experiments show FedOAP achieves better segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art federated learning methods across diverse organ-specific tumor segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: FedOAP successfully models shared features and improves segmentation consistency, setting a benchmark in personalized federated learning for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) possesses the unique capability of preserving data confidentiality among clients while tackling the data heterogeneity problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Its advantages have led to widespread adoption in domains such as medical image segmentation. However, the existing approaches mostly overlook the potential benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, where each client contains segmentation data of different organs. In this work, we introduce a novel personalized federated approach for organ agnostic tumor segmentation (FedOAP), that utilizes cross-attention to model long-range dependencies among the shared features of different clients and a boundary-aware loss to improve segmentation consistency. FedOAP employs a decoupled cross-attention (DCA), which enables each client to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs aggregated from all clients, thereby capturing long-range inter-organ feature dependencies. Additionally, we introduce perturbed boundary loss (PBL) which focuses on the inconsistencies of the predicted mask's boundary for each client, forcing the model to localize the margins more precisely. We evaluate FedOAP on diverse tumor segmentation tasks spanning different organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated and personalized segmentation methods.

*Yilin Wen,Kechuan Dong,Yusuke Sugano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method addressing error accumulation in online test-time adaptation for 3D human pose estimation by utilizing motion discretization with clustering and introducing a soft-reset mechanism for robust long-term adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the train-test domain gap in 3D human pose estimation during online test-time adaptation, which suffers from error accumulation and degraded performance.

Method: Introduce the use of motion discretization through unsupervised clustering, derive regular anchor motions to supervise estimators, and implement a soft-reset mechanism reverting the estimator to an exponential moving average during adaptation.

Result: Demonstrated effective long-term adaptation to out-of-domain streaming test videos with enhanced accuracy by avoiding error accumulation and leveraging personal shape and motion traits.

Conclusion: The approach mitigates challenges in error accumulation during online adaptation and achieves superior performance compared to prior methods, aiding reliable 3D pose estimation in continuous streaming scenarios.

Abstract: Online test-time adaptation addresses the train-test domain gap by adapting the model on unlabeled streaming test inputs before making the final prediction. However, online adaptation for 3D human pose estimation suffers from error accumulation when relying on self-supervision with imperfect predictions, leading to degraded performance over time. To mitigate this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel solution that highlights the use of motion discretization. Specifically, we employ unsupervised clustering in the latent motion representation space to derive a set of anchor motions, whose regularity aids in supervising the human pose estimator and enables efficient self-replay. Additionally, we introduce an effective and efficient soft-reset mechanism by reverting the pose estimator to its exponential moving average during continuous adaptation. We examine long-term online adaptation by continuously adapting to out-of-domain streaming test videos of the same individual, which allows for the capture of consistent personal shape and motion traits throughout the streaming observation. By mitigating error accumulation, our solution enables robust exploitation of these personal traits for enhanced accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms previous online test-time adaptation methods and validate our design choices.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on designing a hybrid saliency model to predict regions of interest (ROIs) in 360° videos for improving streaming efficiency and viewing experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance 360° video streaming by accurately predicting ROIs, reducing bandwidth usage, minimizing head movement in head-mounted devices, and improving streaming quality through efficient video cuts.

Method: The method involves preprocessing video frames, developing a hybrid saliency model for ROI prediction, and post-processing model predictions. The proposed method is evaluated against subjective annotations from the 360RAT dataset.

Result: The hybrid saliency model effectively predicts ROIs and demonstrates its efficiency when compared to subjective annotations.

Conclusion: This approach improves the streaming efficiency and viewing experience of 360° videos, showcasing the potential of hybrid saliency models in real-world applications.

Abstract: The main goal of the project is to design a new model that predicts regions of interest in 360$^{\circ}$ videos. The region of interest (ROI) plays an important role in 360$^{\circ}$ video streaming. For example, ROIs are used to predict view-ports, intelligently cut the videos for live streaming, etc so that less bandwidth is used. Detecting view-ports in advance helps reduce the movement of the head while streaming and watching a video via the head-mounted device. Whereas, intelligent cuts of the videos help improve the efficiency of streaming the video to users and enhance the quality of their viewing experience. This report illustrates the secondary task to identify ROIs, in which, we design, train, and test a hybrid saliency model. In this work, we refer to saliency regions to represent the regions of interest. The method includes the processes as follows: preprocessing the video to obtain frames, developing a hybrid saliency model for predicting the region of interest, and finally post-processing the output predictions of the hybrid saliency model to obtain the output region of interest for each frame. Then, we compare the performance of the proposed method with the subjective annotations of the 360RAT dataset.

*Xiao Cui,Yulei Qin,Xinyue Li,Wengang Zhou,Hongsheng Li,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of existing dataset distillation methods on long-tailed datasets and proposes statistical alignment techniques to mitigate biased model representations. Experiments show significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods fail in long-tailed distributions due to model bias and corrupted Batch Normalization (BN) statistics caused by class imbalance.

Method: The paper introduces a statistical alignment approach with three components: enhanced expert models for statistics estimation and relabeling, recalibrating BN statistics via momentum adjustment, and initializing synthetic images with diverse augmentation selection.

Result: Consistent improvements across four long-tailed benchmarks. Achieved notable accuracy gains: +15.6% on CIFAR-100-LT and +11.8% on Tiny-ImageNet-LT under IPC=10 and IF=10.

Conclusion: Statistical alignment methods effectively address biases in long-tailed dataset distillation, enabling significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Dataset distillation creates a small distilled set that enables efficient training by capturing key information from the full dataset. While existing dataset distillation methods perform well on balanced datasets, they struggle under long-tailed distributions, where imbalanced class frequencies induce biased model representations and corrupt statistical estimates such as Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. In this paper, we rethink long-tailed dataset distillation by revisiting the limitations of trajectory-based methods, and instead adopt the statistical alignment perspective to jointly mitigate model bias and restore fair supervision. To this end, we introduce three dedicated components that enable unbiased recovery of distilled images and soft relabeling: (1) enhancing expert models (an observer model for recovery and a teacher model for relabeling) to enable reliable statistics estimation and soft-label generation; (2) recalibrating BN statistics via a full forward pass with dynamically adjusted momentum to reduce representation skew; (3) initializing synthetic images by incrementally selecting high-confidence and diverse augmentations via a multi-round mechanism that promotes coverage and diversity. Extensive experiments on four long-tailed benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across varying degrees of class imbalance.Notably, our approach improves top-1 accuracy by 15.6% on CIFAR-100-LT and 11.8% on Tiny-ImageNet-LT under IPC=10 and IF=10.

TL;DR: Recent SOD methods use complex architectures, but the new biologically inspired DualGazeNet simplifies design while achieving better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Questioning if SOD methods can achieve high performance by mimicking human vision without architectural complexity.

Method: Developed DualGazeNet, a pure Transformer framework based on dual biological principles observed in human vision.

Result: DualGazeNet outperforms 25 SOD methods in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across benchmarks, with less computation required.

Conclusion: It is feasible to construct a simpler, bi-inspired framework (DualGazeNet), providing SOTA accuracy and efficiency compared to complex SOD methods.

Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) methods aim to improve performance in four key directions: semantic enhancement, boundary refinement, auxiliary task supervision, and multi-modal fusion. In pursuit of continuous gains, these approaches have evolved toward increasingly sophisticated architectures with multi-stage pipelines, specialized fusion modules, edge-guided learning, and elaborate attention mechanisms. However, this complexity paradoxically introduces feature redundancy and cross-component interference that obscure salient cues, ultimately reaching performance bottlenecks. In contrast, human vision achieves efficient salient object identification without such architectural complexity. This contrast raises a fundamental question: can we design a biologically grounded yet architecturally simple SOD framework that dispenses with most of this engineering complexity, while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability? In this work, we answer this question affirmatively by introducing DualGazeNet, a biologically inspired pure Transformer framework that models the dual biological principles of robust representation learning and magnocellular-parvocellular dual-pathway processing with cortical attention modulation in the human visual system. Extensive experiments on five RGB SOD benchmarks show that DualGazeNet consistently surpasses 25 state-of-the-art CNN- and Transformer-based methods. On average, DualGazeNet achieves about 60\% higher inference speed and 53.4\% fewer FLOPs than four Transformer-based baselines of similar capacity (VST++, MDSAM, Sam2unet, and BiRefNet). Moreover, DualGazeNet exhibits strong cross-domain generalization, achieving leading or highly competitive performance on camouflaged and underwater SOD benchmarks without relying on additional modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Texture Splatting (NTS) to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), achieving improved reconstruction performance in diverse 3D and 4D scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting in representational capacity and its effectiveness across various reconstruction tasks.

Method: The proposed Neural Texture Splatting employs a hybrid global neural field (tri-plane and neural decoder) to predict local appearance and geometry across primitives, sharing global texture information.

Result: Neural Texture Splatting delivers state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, geometry, and dynamic reconstruction benchmarks, reducing model size and enabling expressive view/time-dependent effects.

Conclusion: The approach offers a significant advancement by improving reconstruction quality across sparse and dense scenarios while enhancing generalization and texture expressiveness.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading approach for high-quality novel view synthesis, with numerous variants extending its applicability to a broad spectrum of 3D and 4D scene reconstruction tasks. Despite its success, the representational capacity of 3DGS remains limited by the use of 3D Gaussian kernels to model local variations. Recent works have proposed to augment 3DGS with additional per-primitive capacity, such as per-splat textures, to enhance its expressiveness. However, these per-splat texture approaches primarily target dense novel view synthesis with a reduced number of Gaussian primitives, and their effectiveness tends to diminish when applied to more general reconstruction scenarios. In this paper, we aim to achieve concrete performance improvement over state-of-the-art 3DGS variants across a wide range of reconstruction tasks, including novel view synthesis, geometry and dynamic reconstruction, under both sparse and dense input settings. To this end, we introduce Neural Texture Splatting (NTS). At the core of our approach is a global neural field (represented as a hybrid of a tri-plane and a neural decoder) that predicts local appearance and geometric fields for each primitive. By leveraging this shared global representation that models local texture fields across primitives, we significantly reduce model size and facilitate efficient global information exchange, demonstrating strong generalization across tasks. Furthermore, our neural modeling of local texture fields introduces expressive view- and time-dependent effects, a critical aspect that existing methods fail to account for. Extensive experiments show that Neural Texture Splatting consistently improves models and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ParVTS, a framework to reduce computational complexity in multimodal large language models by efficiently pruning visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the latency issue in MLLMs caused by quadratic scaling of self-attention due to high sequence length from visual tokens.

Method: ParVTS partitions visual tokens into subject and non-subject groups, processes them in parallel, and discards non-subject tokens mid-inference to enhance efficiency.

Result: ParVTS prunes up to 88.9% of visual tokens while achieving 1.77x speedup and reducing 70% FLOPs with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: ParVTS is a scalable, training-free, and effective solution for reducing inference time and computational burden in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) deliver impressive vision-language reasoning but suffer steep inference latency because self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length and thousands of visual tokens contributed by high-resolution images. Naively pruning less-informative visual tokens reduces this burden, yet indiscriminate removal can strip away contextual cues essential for background or fine-grained questions, undermining accuracy. In this paper, we present ParVTS (Parallel Vision Token Scheduling), a training-free scheduling framework that partitions visual tokens into subject and non-subject groups, processes them in parallel to transfer their semantics into question tokens, and discards the non-subject path mid-inference to reduce computation. This scheduling reduces computational complexity, requires no heuristics or additional modules, and is compatible with diverse existing MLLM architectures. Experiments across multiple MLLM backbones show that ParVTS prunes up to 88.9% of visual tokens with minimal performance drop, achieving 1.77x speedup and 70% FLOPs reduction.

*Ayca Duran,Christoph Waibel,Bernd Bickel,Iro Armeni,Arno Schlueter*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine-learning pipeline to identify suitable building facades for photovoltaic panels and estimate solar energy potential, addressing the lack of detailed automated facade-level PV planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban decarbonization, specifically for areas where roof-mounted photovoltaics are not feasible, requires accurate and detailed planning to maximize the potential of facade-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).

Method: The paper fine-tunes the SegFormer-B5 model on the CMP Facades dataset, using semantic predictions to create facade-level PV suitability masks and layouts, accounting for panel size and clearance.

Result: Results on 373 facades from ten cities reveal significant differences between theoretical and practical BIPV potential, providing crucial data for urban energy planning.

Conclusion: The pipeline offers a scalable solution for detailed and automated BIPV facade assessment, supporting global efforts for reliable urban decarbonization.

Abstract: Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) facades represent a promising pathway towards urban decarbonization, especially where roof areas are insufficient and ground-mounted arrays are infeasible. Although machine learning-based approaches to support photovoltaic (PV) planning on rooftops are well researched, automated approaches for facades still remain scarce and oversimplified. This paper therefore presents a pipeline that integrates detailed information on the architectural composition of the facade to automatically identify suitable surfaces for PV application and estimate the solar energy potential. The pipeline fine-tunes SegFormer-B5 on the CMP Facades dataset and converts semantic predictions into facade-level PV suitability masks and PV panel layouts considering module sizes and clearances. Applied to a dataset of 373 facades with known dimensions from ten cities, the results show that installable BIPV potential is significantly lower than theoretical potential, thus providing valuable insights for reliable urban energy planning. With the growing availability of facade imagery, the proposed pipeline can be scaled to support BIPV planning in cities worldwide.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MagicWorld, a model that addresses structural instability and error accumulation in interactive video world models, using 3D geometric priors and a history cache mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interactive video world models struggle with maintaining structural stability during viewpoint changes and retaining historical scene information in multi-step interactions, leading to error accumulation and drift.

Method: MagicWorld combines an Action-Guided 3D Geometry Module (AG3D) for explicit geometric constraints and a History Cache Retrieval (HCR) mechanism to utilize past scene frames.

Result: MagicWorld improves scene stability and continuity in interactive video generation through its novel 3D and historical data integration techniques.

Conclusion: By integrating 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval mechanisms, MagicWorld enhances structural consistency and mitigates error accumulation, advancing the field of interactive video world modeling.

Abstract: Recent interactive video world model methods generate scene evolution conditioned on user instructions. Although they achieve impressive results, two key limitations remain. First, they fail to fully exploit the correspondence between instruction-driven scene motion and the underlying 3D geometry, which results in structural instability under viewpoint changes. Second, they easily forget historical information during multi-step interaction, resulting in error accumulation and progressive drift in scene semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose MagicWorld, an interactive video world model that integrates 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval. MagicWorld starts from a single scene image, employs user actions to drive dynamic scene evolution, and autoregressively synthesizes continuous scenes. We introduce the Action-Guided 3D Geometry Module (AG3D), which constructs a point cloud from the first frame of each interaction and the corresponding action, providing explicit geometric constraints for viewpoint transitions and thereby improving structural consistency. We further propose History Cache Retrieval (HCR) mechanism, which retrieves relevant historical frames during generation and injects them as conditioning signals, helping the model utilize past scene information and mitigate error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that MagicWorld achieves notable improvements in scene stability and continuity across interaction iterations.

### [377] [MFmamba: A Multi-function Network for Panchromatic Image Resolution Restoration Based on State-Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18888)
*Qian Jiang,Qianqian Wang,Xin Jin,Michal Wozniak,Shaowen Yao,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MFmamba, a multi-function model designed for enhancing spatial and spectral resolution in remote sensing images, using innovative neural network components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in remote sensing imagery processing, specifically improving spatial and spectral resolution simultaneously with only a PAN input, as existing methods could not address all requirements effectively.

Method: The MFmamba model integrates UNet++ with new elements such as Mamba Upsample Block (MUB), Dual Pool Attention (DPA), and Multi-scale Hybrid Cross Block (MHCB) for feature extraction and enhanced image processing.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that MFmamba achieves competitive results in both metric evaluations and visual quality across multiple tasks using a single PAN image input.

Conclusion: MFmamba successfully combines super-resolution and spectral recovery processing to significantly advance the generation of high-resolution color remote sensing images.

Abstract: Remote sensing images are becoming increasingly widespread in military, earth resource exploration. Because of the limitation of a single sensor, we can obtain high spatial resolution grayscale panchromatic (PAN) images and low spatial resolution color multispectral (MS) images. Therefore, an important issue is to obtain a color image with high spatial resolution when there is only a PAN image at the input. The existing methods improve spatial resolution using super-resolution (SR) technology and spectral recovery using colorization technology. However, the SR technique cannot improve the spectral resolution, and the colorization technique cannot improve the spatial resolution. Moreover, the pansharpening method needs two registered inputs and can not achieve SR. As a result, an integrated approach is expected. To solve the above problems, we designed a novel multi-function model (MFmamba) to realize the tasks of SR, spectral recovery, joint SR and spectral recovery through three different inputs. Firstly, MFmamba utilizes UNet++ as the backbone, and a Mamba Upsample Block (MUB) is combined with UNet++. Secondly, a Dual Pool Attention (DPA) is designed to replace the skip connection in UNet++. Finally, a Multi-scale Hybrid Cross Block (MHCB) is proposed for initial feature extraction. Many experiments show that MFmamba is competitive in evaluation metrics and visual results and performs well in the three tasks when only the input PAN image is used.

*Chenyu Mu,Guihai Chen,Xun Yang,Erkun Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaDCSeg addresses the issue of noisy annotations and ambiguous boundaries in medical image segmentation by dynamically learning pixel-wise weights to suppress noise while refining boundary segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve medical image segmentation by addressing instability caused by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, which compromise model performance.

Method: The method introduces MetaDCSeg, incorporating a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism to dynamically assign optimal pixel-wise weights. This emphasizes hard-to-segment regions and boundary uncertainty for improved segmentation capability.

Result: MetaDCSeg demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets under varying levels of annotation noise.

Conclusion: MetaDCSeg is an effective framework for handling noisy annotations and improving segmentation in medical images, particularly in challenging boundary areas, leading to reliable clinical applicability.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, which lead to instability in model training. Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [379] [Learning What to Trust: Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization for Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18919)
*Ruiying Liu,Yuanzhi Liang,Haibin Huang,Tianshu Yu,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), an improvement over Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to address challenges in textual-visual correspondence for generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's effectiveness is hindered by the ambiguity in textual-visual correspondence, where a single prompt can yield diverse outputs and an image could have multiple interpretations, leading to uncertain feedback signals.

Method: BPGO incorporates a semantic prior anchor to model reward uncertainty. It enhances optimization trust by Bayesian trust allocation across groups and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization, improving signal reliability.

Result: BPGO achieves stronger semantic alignment, better perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence compared to GRPO and its recent variants in both image and video generation tasks.

Conclusion: BPGO effectively overcomes GRPO's limitations, leveraging Bayesian techniques to produce improved and reliable generative model outcomes with enhanced alignment and performance.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as an effective and lightweight framework for post-training visual generative models. However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants.

*Wenhao Xu,Xin Dong,Yue Li,Haoyuan Shi,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EventSTU, a training-free framework that reduces inference costs for video understanding by leveraging event-based vision techniques to eliminate frame redundancy and adaptively reduce spatial tokens, while outperforming previous methods in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high inference costs of video large language models caused by the large number of tokens in long video sequences.

Method: EventSTU employs a coarse-to-fine keyframe sampling algorithm based on event cameras to eliminate redundant frames and an adaptive token pruning algorithm using visual saliency to guide spatial reduction. Additionally, it incorporates question relevance for dynamic token pruning allocation.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 3.01x reduction in FLOPs and a 3.10x increase in prefilling speed over the strongest baseline, with improved performance.

Conclusion: EventSTU offers a novel approach to efficient spatio-temporal video understanding by integrating event-guided strategies. It highlights a significant improvement in computational efficiency and introduces EventBench, a benchmark to evaluate such technologies.

Abstract: Video large language models have demonstrated strong video understanding capabilities but suffer from high inference costs due to the massive number of tokens in long videos. Inspired by event-based vision, we propose an event-guided, training-free framework for efficient spatio-temporal understanding, named EventSTU. In the temporal domain, we design a coarse-to-fine keyframe sampling algorithm that exploits the change-triggered property of event cameras to eliminate redundant frames. In the spatial domain, we design an adaptive token pruning algorithm that leverages the visual saliency of events as a zero-cost prior to guide spatial reduction. From a holistic spatio-temporal perspective, we further integrate question relevance from keyframe sampling to adaptively allocate token pruning budgets. To facilitate evaluation, we construct EventBench, the first event-inclusive, human-annotated multimodal benchmark that covers diverse real-world scenarios. Beyond physical event cameras, EventSTU also supports general video understanding using simulated events. Comprehensive experiments show that EventSTU achieves 3.01x FLOPs reduction and 3.10x prefilling speedup over the strongest baseline while still improving performance.

### [381] [BackdoorVLM: A Benchmark for Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18921)
*Juncheng Li,Yige Li,Hanxun Huang,Yunhao Chen,Xin Wang,Yixu Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces the BackdoorVLM benchmark to evaluate backdoor attacks on vision-language models (VLMs) across diverse scenarios and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to fill the research gap in studying backdoor attacks on multimodal foundation models like VLMs, which remains underexplored compared to unimodal settings.

Method: BackdoorVLM categorizes backdoor threats into 5 types and evaluates them using 12 representative attacks involving text, image, and bimodal triggers tested on 2 VLMs and 3 datasets.

Result: The study finds that VLMs are highly sensitive to text-based triggers, with text triggering often dominating over image triggering. Textual modality proves highly effective, achieving high success rates with minimal data poisoning.

Conclusion: The work underscores the vulnerabilities of VLMs to backdoor attacks and proposes BackdoorVLM as a tool to better understand and mitigate these threats.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning systems by injecting hidden behaviors that can be maliciously activated at inference time. While such threats have been extensively studied in unimodal settings, their impact on multimodal foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{BackdoorVLM}, the first comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating backdoor attacks on VLMs across a broad range of settings. It adopts a unified perspective that injects and analyzes backdoors across core vision-language tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering. BackdoorVLM organizes multimodal backdoor threats into 5 representative categories: targeted refusal, malicious injection, jailbreak, concept substitution, and perceptual hijack. Each category captures a distinct pathway through which an adversary can manipulate a model's behavior. We evaluate these threats using 12 representative attack methods spanning text, image, and bimodal triggers, tested on 2 open-source VLMs and 3 multimodal datasets. Our analysis reveals that VLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to textual instructions, and in bimodal backdoors the text trigger typically overwhelms the image trigger when forming the backdoor mapping. Notably, backdoors involving the textual modality remain highly potent, with poisoning rates as low as 1\% yielding over 90\% success across most tasks. These findings highlight significant, previously underexplored vulnerabilities in current VLMs. We hope that BackdoorVLM can serve as a useful benchmark for analyzing and mitigating multimodal backdoor threats.

*Zhenxing Mi,Yuxin Wang,Dan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: One4D is a unified framework for dynamic 4D generation and reconstruction that transitions seamlessly between generation and reconstruction tasks, utilizing RGB frames and pointmaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in generating and reconstructing high-quality 4D content (RGB + pointmaps) using video diffusion models, enabling more general and accurate 4D world modeling.

Method: One4D introduces Unified Masked Conditioning (UMC) to handle varying sparsities of frames. It employs Decoupled LoRA Control (DLC) with modality-specific branches to address modality degradation during training. The framework uses synthetic and real datasets.

Result: The framework produces high-quality RGB frames and accurate pointmaps across 4D generation and reconstruction tasks, while maintaining pixel-level consistency between modalities.

Conclusion: One4D demonstrates a step forward in 4D modeling by leveraging innovative mechanisms for synchronized RGB and pointmap generations, advancing dynamic 4D content production.

Abstract: We present One4D, a unified framework for 4D generation and reconstruction that produces dynamic 4D content as synchronized RGB frames and pointmaps. By consistently handling varying sparsities of conditioning frames through a Unified Masked Conditioning (UMC) mechanism, One4D can seamlessly transition between 4D generation from a single image, 4D reconstruction from a full video, and mixed generation and reconstruction from sparse frames. Our framework adapts a powerful video generation model for joint RGB and pointmap generation, with carefully designed network architectures. The commonly used diffusion finetuning strategies for depthmap or pointmap reconstruction often fail on joint RGB and pointmap generation, quickly degrading the base video model. To address this challenge, we introduce Decoupled LoRA Control (DLC), which employs two modality-specific LoRA adapters to form decoupled computation branches for RGB frames and pointmaps, connected by lightweight, zero-initialized control links that gradually learn mutual pixel-level consistency. Trained on a mixture of synthetic and real 4D datasets under modest computational budgets, One4D produces high-quality RGB frames and accurate pointmaps across both generation and reconstruction tasks. This work represents a step toward general, high-quality geometry-based 4D world modeling using video diffusion models. Project page: https://mizhenxing.github.io/One4D

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Test-time adaptation (TTA) technique leveraging attention entropy minimization to improve model robustness on shifted distributions while preserving performance on clean data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address distribution shifts during inference and enhance model robustness using transformer-based unsupervised learning signals.

Method: Proposes minimizing entropy of attention distributions (CLS token to image patches) as a new objective for TTA, effective even with a single test image available.

Result: Method improves robustness to corrupted data without sacrificing performance on clean images.

Conclusion: Attention entropy minimization is effective for TTA in providing robustness under diverse shifts without performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables models to adapt to distribution shifts at inference time. While entropy minimization over the output distribution has proven effective for TTA, transformers offer an additional unsupervised learning signal through their attention mechanisms. We propose minimizing the entropy of attention distributions from the CLS token to image patches as a novel TTA objective.This approach encourages the model to attend more confidently to relevant image regions under distribution shift and is effective even when only a single test image is available. We demonstrate that attention entropy minimization improves robustness across diverse corruption types while not hurting performance on clean data on a single sample stream of images at test time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineXtrol is presented as a framework for precise motion generation using detailed and temporally-aware text descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in motion controllability and efficiency in text-driven motion generation methods.

Method: FineXtrol employs temporally-aware, fine-grained textual controls and uses a hierarchical contrastive learning module to improve motion controllability.

Result: Quantitative results highlight its strong performance, and qualitative assessments show its ability to control specific body parts effectively.

Conclusion: FineXtrol offers an efficient and precise approach for text-driven, controllable motion generation, enhancing user control in motion creation.

Abstract: Recent works have sought to enhance the controllability and precision of text-driven motion generation. Some approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to produce more detailed texts, while others incorporate global 3D coordinate sequences as additional control signals. However, the former often introduces misaligned details and lacks explicit temporal cues, and the latter incurs significant computational cost when converting coordinates to standard motion representations. To address these issues, we propose FineXtrol, a novel control framework for efficient motion generation guided by temporally-aware, precise, user-friendly, and fine-grained textual control signals that describe specific body part movements over time. In support of this framework, we design a hierarchical contrastive learning module that encourages the text encoder to produce more discriminative embeddings for our novel control signals, thereby improving motion controllability. Quantitative results show that FineXtrol achieves strong performance in controllable motion generation, while qualitative analysis demonstrates its flexibility in directing specific body part movements.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HOTD, a framework for discovering human-centric tasks in dynamic, open-future situations, supported by a unique benchmark and achieving superior results using the CMAST framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying tasks in dynamic, open-future scenarios that reduce human effort, advancing LMMs for real-world utility.

Method: 1. Formalization of the problem as Human-centric Open-future Task Discovery (HOTD). 2. Creation of HOTD-Bench with real-world examples, annotations, and simulation protocol. 3. Development of CMAST framework using multi-agent reasoning and search tree structure.

Result: CMAST outperforms existing LMMs on HOTD-Bench, showing notable performance improvements and effective integration.

Conclusion: The proposal enhances LMMs’ capacity to discover practical and effort-reducing tasks for humans in unpredictable future scenarios.

Abstract: Recent progress in robotics and embodied AI is largely driven by Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, a key challenge remains underexplored: how can we advance LMMs to discover tasks that directly assist humans in open-future scenarios, where human intentions are highly concurrent and dynamic. In this work, we formalize the problem of Human-centric Open-future Task Discovery (HOTD), focusing particularly on identifying tasks that reduce human effort across multiple plausible futures. To facilitate this study, we propose an HOTD-Bench, which features over 2K real-world videos, a semi-automated annotation pipeline, and a simulation-based protocol tailored for open-set future evaluation. Additionally, we propose the Collaborative Multi-Agent Search Tree (CMAST) framework, which decomposes the complex reasoning through a multi-agent system and structures the reasoning process through a scalable search tree module. In our experiments, CMAST achieves the best performance on the HOTD-Bench, significantly surpassing existing LMMs. It also integrates well with existing LMMs, consistently improving performance.

*Zong-Wei Hong,Jing-lun Li,Lin-Ze Li,Shen Zhang,Yao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VeCoR, a contrastive training scheme to improve the flow-based generative modeling, yielding significant improvements in efficiency and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Flow Matching (FM) models face challenges such as accumulated errors along trajectories, leading to perceptual degradation, especially in lightweight or low-step settings.

Method: VeCoR extends FM by introducing Velocity Contrastive Regularization, which adds contrastive supervision to guide velocities in both attractive (positive) and repelling (negative) directions, thus improving stability and trajectory evolution.

Result: VeCoR shows significant improvements in relative FID reductions (22% and 35% on ImageNet-1K, and 32% on MS-COCO) with enhanced stability and image quality, even in challenging configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed VeCoR approach transforms flow-based generative modeling into a balanced, two-sided process that enhances perceptual quality and convergence in generative tasks.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has recently emerged as a principled and efficient alternative to diffusion models. Standard FM encourages the learned velocity field to follow a target direction; however, it may accumulate errors along the trajectory and drive samples off the data manifold, leading to perceptual degradation, especially in lightweight or low-step configurations.
  To enhance stability and generalization, we extend FM into a balanced attract-repel scheme that provides explicit guidance on both "where to go" and "where not to go." To be formal, we propose \textbf{Velocity Contrastive Regularization (VeCoR)}, a complementary training scheme for flow-based generative modeling that augments the standard FM objective with contrastive, two-sided supervision. VeCoR not only aligns the predicted velocity with a stable reference direction (positive supervision) but also pushes it away from inconsistent, off-manifold directions (negative supervision). This contrastive formulation transforms FM from a purely attractive, one-sided objective into a two-sided training signal, regularizing trajectory evolution and improving perceptual fidelity across datasets and backbones.
  On ImageNet-1K 256$\times$256, VeCoR yields 22\% and 35\% relative FID reductions on SiT-XL/2 and REPA-SiT-XL/2 backbones, respectively, and achieves further FID gains (32\% relative) on MS-COCO text-to-image generation, demonstrating consistent improvements in stability, convergence, and image quality, particularly in low-step and lightweight settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the CSSP2P GAN, a model for virtual staining that achieves high pathological fidelity through expert evaluation and emphasizes the importance of adversarial loss in image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional immunohistochemistry techniques for evaluating specific proteins within tissue, as current practices are costly and labor-intensive.

Method: The authors develop CSSP2P GAN, a virtual staining model based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, and include an in-depth study of adversarial loss impact and redesign of evaluation approaches.

Result: The model achieved superior pathological fidelity, supported by blind pathological expert evaluation and demonstrated to outperform existing methods through enhanced metric performance analysis.

Conclusion: CSSP2P GAN is an advanced virtual staining model that addresses critical limitations in existing methodologies, proves the importance of adversarial loss, and sets a standard for robust evaluation and superior image quality.

Abstract: In addition to evaluating tumor morphology using H&E staining, immunohistochemistry is used to assess the presence of specific proteins within the tissue. However, this is a costly and labor-intensive technique, for which virtual staining, as an image-to-image translation task, offers a promising alternative. Although recent, this is an emerging field of research with 64% of published studies just in 2024. Most studies use publicly available datasets of H&E-IHC pairs from consecutive tissue sections. Recognizing the training challenges, many authors develop complex virtual staining models based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, but ignore the impact of adversarial loss on the quality of virtual staining. Furthermore, overlooking the issues of model evaluation, they claim improved performance based on metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, which are not sufficiently robust to evaluate the quality of virtually stained images. In this paper, we developed CSSP2P GAN, which we demonstrate to achieve heightened pathological fidelity through a blind pathological expert evaluation. Furthermore, while iteratively developing our model, we study the impact of the adversarial loss and demonstrate its crucial role in the quality of virtually stained images. Finally, while comparing our model with reference works in the field, we underscore the limitations of the currently used evaluation metrics and demonstrate the superior performance of CSSP2P GAN.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a high-resolution dataset and a new evaluation metric (VGID) to address texture detail capture and close-up video needs for virtual try-on solutions in fashion e-commerce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Virtual try-on videos are hindered by challenges in texture detail capture and the lack of close-up video options in existing datasets.

Method: The authors present a high-resolution dataset containing full-shot and close-up videos, detailed garment images, textual descriptions, and propose a garment consistency metric, VGID.

Result: Using the dataset, existing video generation models enhance texture detail fidelity in virtual try-on, and a benchmark highlights structural preservation challenges.

Conclusion: By addressing critical limitations through improved datasets and evaluation tools, the paper significantly advances virtual try-on realism and functionality in e-commerce.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on technology provides a cost-effective solution for creating marketing videos in fashion e-commerce. However, its practical adoption is hindered by two critical limitations. First, the reliance on a single garment image as input in current virtual try-on datasets limits the accurate capture of realistic texture details. Second, most existing methods focus solely on generating full-shot virtual try-on videos, neglecting the business's demand for videos that also provide detailed close-ups. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-resolution dataset for video-based virtual try-on. This dataset offers two key features. First, it provides more detailed information on the garments, which includes high-fidelity images with detailed close-ups and textual descriptions; Second, it uniquely includes full-shot and close-up try-on videos of real human models. Furthermore, accurately assessing consistency becomes significantly more critical for the close-up videos, which demand high-fidelity preservation of garment details. To facilitate such fine-grained evaluation, we propose a new garment consistency metric VGID (Video Garment Inception Distance) that quantifies the preservation of both texture and structure. Our experiments validate these contributions. We demonstrate that by utilizing the detailed images from our dataset, existing video generation models can extract and incorporate texture features, significantly enhancing the realism and detail fidelity of virtual try-on results. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of recent models. The benchmark effectively identifies the texture and structural preservation problems among current methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CataractCompDetect, an AI-based framework for detecting complications during cataract surgeries using a novel video dataset, achieving notable performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cataract surgeries, despite being common, are prone to rare but significant intraoperative complications. Early detection and objective feedback mechanisms can improve outcomes and training.

Method: The proposed framework combines phase-aware localization, SAM 2-based tracking, risk scoring for specific complications, and vision-language reasoning for classification.

Result: Validation on the curated CataComp dataset yielded an average F1 score of 70.63%, with high performances on detecting specific complications such as Iris Prolapse (81.8%), PCR (60.87%), and Vitreous Loss (69.23%).

Conclusion: Integrating structured surgical knowledge and AI-based approaches enhances complication recognition, paving the way for improved intraoperative management and training in cataract surgeries.

Abstract: Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgeries worldwide, yet intraoperative complications such as iris prolapse, posterior capsule rupture (PCR), and vitreous loss remain major causes of adverse outcomes. Automated detection of such events could enable early warning systems and objective training feedback. In this work, we propose CataractCompDetect, a complication detection framework that combines phase-aware localization, SAM 2-based tracking, complication-specific risk scoring, and vision-language reasoning for final classification. To validate CataractCompDetect, we curate CataComp, the first cataract surgery video dataset annotated for intraoperative complications, comprising 53 surgeries, including 23 with clinical complications. On CataComp, CataractCompDetect achieves an average F1 score of 70.63%, with per-complication performance of 81.8% (Iris Prolapse), 60.87% (PCR), and 69.23% (Vitreous Loss). These results highlight the value of combining structured surgical priors with vision-language reasoning for recognizing rare but high-impact intraoperative events. Our dataset and code will be publicly released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: This paper tackles challenges in adapting CNNs for FHE inference, offering methods to minimize accuracy loss with low-degree polynomials and enable efficient image processing via ciphertext capacity enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the barriers of non-linear activations and ciphertext capacity constraints that hinder CNN adaptation to FHE while maintaining competitive accuracy and enabling high-resolution processing.

Method: Proposed a single-stage fine-tuning (SFT) strategy to convert pre-trained CNNs for FHE compatibility, and introduced a generalized interleaved packing (GIP) scheme with homomorphic operators for flexible encryption.

Result: Demonstrated competitive accuracy with SFT-generated FHE-friendly CNNs on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, MS COCO, and FHE-based inference on YOLO models for object detection.

Conclusion: The paper successfully enables efficient, end-to-end FHE inference in CNNs with high accuracy and extends FHE applications to YOLO for object detection.

Abstract: We address two fundamental challenges in adapting general deep CNNs for FHE-based inference: approximating non-linear activations such as ReLU with low-degree polynomials while minimizing accuracy degradation, and overcoming the ciphertext capacity barrier that constrains high-resolution image processing on FHE inference. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a single-stage fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that directly converts pre-trained CNNs into FHE-friendly forms using low-degree polynomials, achieving competitive accuracy with minimal training overhead; and (2) a generalized interleaved packing (GIP) scheme that is compatible with feature maps of virtually arbitrary spatial resolutions, accompanied by a suite of carefully designed homomorphic operators that preserve the GIP-form encryption throughout computation. These advances enable efficient, end-to-end FHE inference across diverse CNN architectures. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MS COCO demonstrate that the FHE-friendly CNNs obtained via our SFT strategy achieve accuracy comparable to baselines using ReLU or SiLU activations. Moreover, this work presents the first demonstration of FHE-based inference for YOLO architectures in object detection leveraging low-degree polynomial activations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of annotating cutaneous neoplasm biopsies due to their high morphological variability and overlap between benign and malignant lesions.

Method: Develop and utilize a visual-language segmentation pipeline leveraging vision-language models, partitioning images into patches, using textual prompt ensembles for segmentation.

Result: ZEUS demonstrated competitive performance on in-house datasets, reducing annotation workload and enhancing diagnostic workflows.

Conclusion: ZEUS provides a scalable, explainable approach for high-resolution tumor segmentation in whole-slide images, improving histopathology workflows.

Abstract: Accurate annotation of cutaneous neoplasm biopsies represents a major challenge due to their wide morphological variability, overlapping histological patterns, and the subtle distinctions between benign and malignant lesions. Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), pre-trained on paired image-text corpora, learn joint representations that bridge visual features and diagnostic terminology, enabling zero-shot localization and classification of tissue regions without pixel-level labels. However, most existing VLM applications in histopathology remain limited to slide-level tasks or rely on coarse interactive prompts, and they struggle to produce fine-grained segmentations across gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this work, we introduce a zero-shot visual-language segmentation pipeline for whole-slide images (ZEUS), a fully automated, zero-shot segmentation framework that leverages class-specific textual prompt ensembles and frozen VLM encoders to generate high-resolution tumor masks in WSIs. By partitioning each WSI into overlapping patches, extracting visual embeddings, and computing cosine similarities against text prompts, we generate a final segmentation mask. We demonstrate competitive performance on two in-house datasets, primary spindle cell neoplasms and cutaneous metastases, highlighting the influence of prompt design, domain shifts, and institutional variability in VLMs for histopathology. ZEUS markedly reduces annotation burden while offering scalable, explainable tumor delineation for downstream diagnostic workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework designed to tackle deepfake detection challenges caused by different compression rates in social media streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is to address the challenges of deepfake detection in real-world scenarios, specifically the difficulty of handling varying levels of compression, feature degradation, and the high cost of multimodal data collection and inconsistent quality.

Method: The authors propose a UMCL framework that generates three complementary features (rPPG signals, temporal landmark dynamics, semantic embeddings) from a single visual modality. These features are aligned using an affinity-driven semantic alignment (ASA) strategy with contrastive learning, and robustness across compression rates is further enhanced through cross-quality similarity learning (CQSL).

Result: The proposed method demonstrated superior performance across different compression rates and manipulation types, setting a new benchmark in robust deepfake detection. It retains high accuracy even when individual features degrade.

Conclusion: The UMCL framework significantly improves cross-compression-rate deepfake detection while providing interpretable insights into feature relationships, making it an effective and reliable approach for real-world applications.

Abstract: In deepfake detection, the varying degrees of compression employed by social media platforms pose significant challenges for model generalization and reliability. Although existing methods have progressed from single-modal to multimodal approaches, they face critical limitations: single-modal methods struggle with feature degradation under data compression in social media streaming, while multimodal approaches require expensive data collection and labeling and suffer from inconsistent modal quality or accessibility in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework for robust cross-compression-rate (CCR) deepfake detection. In the training stage, our approach transforms a single visual modality into three complementary features: compression-robust rPPG signals, temporal landmark dynamics, and semantic embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models. These features are explicitly aligned through an affinity-driven semantic alignment (ASA) strategy, which models inter-modal relationships through affinity matrices and optimizes their consistency through contrastive learning. Subsequently, our cross-quality similarity learning (CQSL) strategy enhances feature robustness across compression rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across various compression rates and manipulation types, establishing a new benchmark for robust deepfake detection. Notably, our approach maintains high detection accuracy even when individual features degrade, while providing interpretable insights into feature relationships through explicit alignment.

### [393] [Rethinking Plant Disease Diagnosis: Bridging the Academic-Practical Gap with Vision Transformers and Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18989)
*Wassim Benabbas,Mohammed Brahimi,Samir Akhrouf,Bilal Fortas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores the use of attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning for plant disease classification, addressing the gap between academic datasets and real-world field conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing plant disease models trained on curated datasets fail to generalize to real-world field images submitted by farmers. This gap calls for techniques that adapt better to practical conditions.

Method: The research evaluates three model categories: CNNs, Vision Transformers, and CLIP-based zero-shot models for their ability to handle domain shifts in plant images.

Result: CNNs showed limited robustness under domain shifts, Vision Transformers had better generalization, and CLIP models performed strongly with task adaptability and interpretability.

Conclusion: Zero-shot learning with CLIP models provides a scalable and effective domain adaptation strategy for plant disease classification in diverse, real-world agricultural conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in plant disease classification using leaf images. Much of the existing research in this field has relied on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of well-centered plant images captured against uniform, uncluttered backgrounds. Although models trained on this dataset achieve high accuracy, they often fail to generalize to real-world field images, such as those submitted by farmers to plant diagnostic systems. This has created a significant gap between published studies and practical application requirements, highlighting the necessity of investigating and addressing this issue. In this study, we investigate whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning approaches can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world agricultural conditions in plant disease classification. We evaluate three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based zero-shot models. While CNNs exhibit limited robustness under domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrate stronger generalization by capturing global contextual features. Most notably, CLIP models classify diseases directly from natural language descriptions without any task-specific training, offering strong adaptability and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of zero-shot learning as a practical and scalable domain adaptation strategy for plant health diagnosis in diverse field environments.

*Duolikun Danier,Ge Gao,Steven McDonagh,Changjian Li,Hakan Bilen,Oisin Mac Aodha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates ways to improve 3D consistency in video generation models using the proposed method ViCoDR, focused on multi-view consistent diffusion representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress, current video generation models produce artifacts when handling 3D changes in camera perspectives, reducing quality and realism.

Method: The authors propose ViCoDR, a method that learns multi-view consistent diffusion representations to enhance 3D consistency in video generation.

Result: ViCoDR significantly improves the 3D consistency of generated videos when evaluated across camera-controlled image-to-video, text-to-video, and multi-view generation tasks.

Conclusion: Improving multi-view consistency correlates with better 3D consistency in generated videos, and ViCoDR demonstrates effectiveness in achieving this enhancement.

Abstract: Video generation models have made significant progress in generating realistic content, enabling applications in simulation, gaming, and film making. However, current generated videos still contain visual artifacts arising from 3D inconsistencies, e.g., objects and structures deforming under changes in camera pose, which can undermine user experience and simulation fidelity. Motivated by recent findings on representation alignment for diffusion models, we hypothesize that improving the multi-view consistency of video diffusion representations will yield more 3D-consistent video generation. Through detailed analysis on multiple recent camera-controlled video diffusion models we reveal strong correlations between 3D-consistent representations and videos. We also propose ViCoDR, a new approach for improving the 3D consistency of video models by learning multi-view consistent diffusion representations. We evaluate ViCoDR on camera controlled image-to-video, text-to-video, and multi-view generation models, demonstrating significant improvements in the 3D consistency of the generated videos.

*Christos Koutlis,Symeon Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method (AuViRe) for detecting and temporally localizing deepfakes by leveraging audio-visual cross-modal discrepancies, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing prevalence and sophistication of synthetic audio-visual content, particularly for malicious manipulations, highlights the crucial need for robust methods to verify digital media integrity.

Method: The proposed AuViRe method reconstructs speech representations from one modality (like lip movements) using another modality (like audio waveform). Manipulated video segments present larger cross-modal reconstruction challenges, which are exploited to identify temporal deepfake regions.

Result: AuViRe shows significant improvement over existing methods, with performance boosts such as +8.9 AP@0.95 on LAV-DF, +9.6 AP@0.5 on AV-Deepfake1M, and +5.1 AUC in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: AuViRe demonstrates its efficacy in detecting and localizing deepfakes temporally, leveraging modality-based reconstruction challenges to achieve superior performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of sophisticated synthetic audio-visual content, e.g., for subtle malicious manipulations, ensuring the integrity of digital media has become paramount. This work presents a novel approach to temporal localization of deepfakes by leveraging Audio-Visual Speech Representation Reconstruction (AuViRe). Specifically, our approach reconstructs speech representations from one modality (e.g., lip movements) based on the other (e.g., audio waveform). Cross-modal reconstruction is significantly more challenging in manipulated video segments, leading to amplified discrepancies, thereby providing robust discriminative cues for precise temporal forgery localization. AuViRe outperforms the state of the art by +8.9 AP@0.95 on LAV-DF, +9.6 AP@0.5 on AV-Deepfake1M, and +5.1 AUC on an in-the-wild experiment. Code available at https://github.com/mever-team/auvire.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2LDM proposes a Text-to-LiDAR diffusion model with improved geometric detail generation and controllability, addressing challenges in Text-to-LiDAR pair scarcity and text quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of limited Text-LiDAR pairs and low-quality text descriptions, which lead to overly smooth generation and compromised control over LiDAR data.

Method: The paper introduces the Text-to-LiDAR Diffusion Model (T2LDM) with Self-Conditioned Representation Guidance (SCRG) to align real representations and provide soft supervision for scene reconstruction. It also introduces a benchmark (T2nuScenes), a controllability metric, and a directional position prior for scene fidelity improvement.

Result: T2LDM demonstrated richer geometric details, better scene fidelity, and higher controllability, outperforming existing methods across unconditional and conditional generation tasks.

Conclusion: T2LDM effectively enhances Text-to-LiDAR generation quality and controllability, offering practical prompt insights and achieving state-of-the-art scene generation.

Abstract: Text-to-LiDAR generation can customize 3D data with rich structures and diverse scenes for downstream tasks. However, the scarcity of Text-LiDAR pairs often causes insufficient training priors, generating overly smooth 3D scenes. Moreover, low-quality text descriptions may degrade generation quality and controllability. In this paper, we propose a Text-to-LiDAR Diffusion Model for scene generation, named T2LDM, with a Self-Conditioned Representation Guidance (SCRG). Specifically, SCRG, by aligning to the real representations, provides the soft supervision with reconstruction details for the Denoising Network (DN) in training, while decoupled in inference. In this way, T2LDM can perceive rich geometric structures from data distribution, generating detailed objects in scenes. Meanwhile, we construct a content-composable Text-LiDAR benchmark, T2nuScenes, along with a controllability metric. Based on this, we analyze the effects of different text prompts for LiDAR generation quality and controllability, providing practical prompt paradigms and insights. Furthermore, a directional position prior is designed to mitigate street distortion, further improving scene fidelity. Additionally, by learning a conditional encoder via frozen DN, T2LDM can support multiple conditional tasks, including Sparse-to-Dense, Dense-to-Sparse, and Semantic-to-LiDAR generation. Extensive experiments in unconditional and conditional generation demonstrate that T2LDM outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation.

*Qiyang Yu,Yu Fang,Tianrui Li,Xuemei Cao,Yan Chen,Jianghao Li,Fan Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Granularity-driven Vision Transformer (Grc-ViT) optimizes image analysis by dynamically adjusting visual granularity based on complexity, improving both accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers often struggle with representing fine-grained local details despite excelling at capturing global dependencies.

Method: The proposed Grc-ViT dynamically adapts granularity in two stages: Coarse Granularity Evaluation and Fine-grained Refinement using image complexity metrics and learnable parameters.

Result: Grc-ViT improves fine-grained discrimination while obtaining a better balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The Grc-ViT model effectively addresses limitations in ViTs by adaptively balancing global and local feature representation, proving both effective and efficient.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing global dependencies but often struggle to efficiently represent fine-grained local details. Existing multi-scale approaches alleviate this issue by integrating hierarchical or hybrid features; however, they rely on fixed patch sizes and introduce redundant computation. To address these limitations, we propose Granularity-driven Vision Transformer (Grc-ViT), a dynamic coarse-to-fine framework that adaptively adjusts visual granularity based on image complexity. It comprises two key stages: (1) Coarse Granularity Evaluation module, which assesses visual complexity using edge density, entropy, and frequency-domain cues to estimate suitable patch and window sizes; (2) Fine-grained Refinement module, which refines attention computation according to the selected granularity, enabling efficient and precise feature learning. Two learnable parameters, α and \b{eta}, are optimized end-to-end to balance global reasoning and local perception. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Grc-ViT enhances fine-grained discrimination while achieving a superior trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper presents Life-IQA, a novel BIQA framework using GCN-enhanced layer interaction and MoE-based feature decoupling for decoding quality features more accurately and efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing BIQA methods, such as unequal contributions of shallow and deep features to quality prediction, and underexplored decoding architectures.

Method: Life-IQA employs GCN-enhanced layer interaction using query-key-value cross-attention and a MoE-based feature decoupling module to specialize in distortion types or quality dimensions.

Result: The proposed Life-IQA framework achieves state-of-the-art BIQA performance on several benchmarks with better accuracy-cost balance compared to vanilla Transformer decoders.

Conclusion: Life-IQA effectively enhances BIQA by investigating feature contributions and proposing innovative decoding frameworks, improving visual quality assessment.

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) plays a crucial role in evaluating and optimizing visual experience. Most existing BIQA approaches fuse shallow and deep features extracted from backbone networks, while overlooking the unequal contributions to quality prediction. Moreover, while various vision encoder backbones are widely adopted in BIQA, the effective quality decoding architectures remain underexplored. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the contributions of shallow and deep features to BIQA, and proposes a effective quality feature decoding framework via GCN-enhanced \underline{l}ayer\underline{i}nteraction and MoE-based \underline{f}eature d\underline{e}coupling, termed \textbf{(Life-IQA)}. Specifically, the GCN-enhanced layer interaction module utilizes the GCN-enhanced deepest-layer features as query and the penultimate-layer features as key, value, then performs cross-attention to achieve feature interaction. Moreover, a MoE-based feature decoupling module is proposed to decouple fused representations though different experts specialized for specific distortion types or quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Life-IQA shows more favorable balance between accuracy and cost than a vanilla Transformer decoder and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BIQA benchmarks.The code is available at: \href{https://github.com/TANGLONG2/Life-IQA/tree/main}{\texttt{Life-IQA}}.

*Xiangjie Sui,Songyang Li,Hanwei Zhu,Baoliang Chen,Yuming Fang,Xin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights the insufficient study of robustness in large vision-language models under visual corruptions and introduces Bench-C, a new benchmark alongside the Robustness Alignment Score (RAS) to effectively evaluate model behavior under such challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gaps in evaluating robustness of LVLMs under visual corruptions, particularly focusing on discriminative samples and prediction structure degradation.

Method: Introduced Bench-C to emphasize discriminative samples for corruption robustness and proposed RAS to measure prediction degradation considering prediction uncertainty and calibration alignment shifts.

Result: Experiments show distinct behaviors in LVLMs under corruptions, revealing confidence patterns, hesitation, accuracy shifts, degradation, and reveal failure/recovery across models through robustness decomposition.

Conclusion: Bench-C and RAS effectively uncover critical insights into LVLM behavior under visual corruptions, offering more thorough evaluation standards and revealing model-specific robustness dynamics.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable reasoning abilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), their robustness under visual corruptions remains insufficiently studied. Existing evaluation paradigms exhibit two major limitations: 1) the dominance of low-discriminative samples in current datasets masks the real robustness gap between models; and 2) conventional accuracy-based metric fail to capture the degradation of the underlying prediction structure. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Bench-C, a comprehensive benchmark emphasizing discriminative samples for assessing corruption robustness, where a selection strategy is proposed to jointly consider the prediction inconsistency under corruption and the semantic diversity. Furthermore, we propose the Robustness Alignment Score (RAS), a unified metric that measures degradation in logit-level prediction structure by considering the shifts in prediction uncertainty and calibration alignment. Comprehensive experiments and analysis reveal several interesting findings: 1) model behaviors exhibit distinguish patterns under corruptions, such as erroneous confidence and hesitation; 2) despite subtle corruption may lead to a slight accuracy gain, the overall prediction structure still degrades; 3) by decomposing corruption robustness into destructive and corrective components, the distinct failure and recovery patterns across models can be revealed.

*Gengyuan Zhang,Mingcong Ding,Jingpei Wu,Ruotong Liao,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReEXplore is a training-free framework for embodied exploration that improves navigation and efficiency using retrospective experience replay and hierarchical frontier selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study targets improving embodied exploration by addressing challenges in using MLLMs, such as reliance on outdated pre-trained knowledge, computational expense of training, and complexity in decision-making in large action spaces.

Method: ReEXplore combines retrospective experience replay to integrate distilled experience during inference and a hierarchical frontier selection technique for more effective decision-making.

Result: The proposed framework achieves up to 3x higher performance in both success rate and navigation efficiency compared to strong MLLM baselines in embodied exploration benchmarks.

Conclusion: ReEXplore enhances the robustness, traceability, and efficiency of embodied exploration, presenting a significant improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: Embodied exploration is a target-driven process that requires embodied agents to possess fine-grained perception and knowledge-enhanced decision making. While recent attempts leverage MLLMs for exploration due to their strong perceptual and reasoning abilities, we find that MLLM-based embodied agents remain suboptimal in exploring new environments: (i) they rely on profound but stale pre-trained knowledge, (ii) training-based approaches such as imitation learning or reinforcement learning are expensive for long-horizon tasks with sparse outcome rewards, and (iii) frontier-based exploration yields a large, visually nuanced action space that is difficult for MLLMs to make reliable decisions. We address these challenges with ReEXplore, a training-free framework that performs retrospective experience replay to inject distilled, abstract experience at inference time, and hierarchical frontier selection to decompose frontier ranking into coarse-to-fine decisions. Our approach enables robust, traceable, and efficient exploration. Across multiple embodied exploration benchmarks, ReEXplore yields great improvements over strong MLLM baselines, up to 3x higher performance in both success rate and in navigation efficiency under open-source backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel architecture, MC-DiSNet, utilizing a pre-trained DINOv3 model, to address damage assessment in conflict zones using the new Gaza-change dataset and proposes a task called changed semantic detection (CSD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conflict zones require rapid and accurate damage assessment to facilitate humanitarian aid. Traditional approaches face challenges due to limited data, annotation difficulties, and high intra-class similarities in damaged architecture.

Method: The paper proposes MC-DiSNet, a multi-scale cross-attention siamese network based on the DINOv3 model, and introduces the Gaza-change dataset with high-resolution satellite images and pixel-level annotations focused on changed areas.

Result: Experimental evaluations on the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets show that MC-DiSNet achieves effective performance for the new CSD framework, addressing challenges of limited annotations and change detection.

Conclusion: The introduced approach not only improves semantic change detection but also establishes a framework for practical, fast damage assessment in conflict areas.

Abstract: Accurately and swiftly assessing damage from conflicts is crucial for humanitarian aid and regional stability. In conflict zones, damaged zones often share similar architectural styles, with damage typically covering small areas and exhibiting blurred boundaries. These characteristics lead to limited data, annotation difficulties, and significant recognition challenges, including high intra-class similarity and ambiguous semantic changes. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet). The powerful visual representation capability of the DINOv3 backbone enables robust and rich feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images. We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. Unlike conventional semantic change detection (SCD), our approach eliminates the need for large-scale semantic annotations of bi-temporal images, instead focusing directly on the changed regions. We term this new task change semantic detection (CSD). The CSD task represents a direct extension of binary change detection (BCD). Due to the limited spatial extent of semantic regions, it presents greater challenges than traditional SCD tasks. We evaluated our method under the CSD framework on both the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively addresses the CSD task, and its outstanding performance paves the way for practical applications in rapid damage assessment across conflict zones.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental for biomedical discovery. Existing methods lack generalizability and demand extensive, time-consuming manual annotation for new clinical application. Here, we propose MedSAM-3, a text promptable medical segmentation model for medical image and video segmentation. By fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3 architecture on medical images paired with semantic conceptual labels, our MedSAM-3 enables medical Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS), allowing precise targeting of anatomical structures via open-vocabulary text descriptions rather than solely geometric prompts. We further introduce the MedSAM-3 Agent, a framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform complex reasoning and iterative refinement in an agent-in-the-loop workflow. Comprehensive experiments across diverse medical imaging modalities, including X-ray, MRI, Ultrasound, CT, and video, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing specialist and foundation models. We will release our code and model at https://github.com/Joey-S-Liu/MedSAM3.

TL;DR: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) faces challenges related to likelihood displacement, undermining its effectiveness in diffusion-based video generation models. A new method, Policy-Guided DPO (PG-DPO), addresses this issue and improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of DPO in aligning generative outputs, particularly in handling likelihood displacement in diffusion-based models, and optimize performance for video generation tasks.

Method: The study introduces Policy-Guided DPO (PG-DPO), which incorporates Adaptive Rejection Scaling (ARS) and Implicit Preference Regularization (IPR) to manage likelihood displacement and mitigate optimization issues.

Result: PG-DPO effectively addresses the limitations of traditional DPO, showing superior results in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations for preference alignment in video generation tasks.

Conclusion: Policy-Guided DPO (PG-DPO) presents a significant improvement in mitigating likelihood displacement and optimizing preference alignment for diffusion-based video generation models.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promising results in aligning generative outputs with human preferences by distinguishing between chosen and rejected samples. However, a critical limitation of DPO is likelihood displacement, where the probabilities of chosen samples paradoxically decrease during training, undermining the quality of generation. Although this issue has been investigated in autoregressive models, its impact within diffusion-based models remains largely unexplored. This gap leads to suboptimal performance in tasks involving video generation. To address this, we conduct a formal analysis of DPO loss through updating policy within the diffusion framework, which describes how the updating of specific training samples influences the model's predictions on other samples. Using this tool, we identify two main failure modes: (1) Optimization Conflict, which arises from small reward margins between chosen and rejected samples, and (2) Suboptimal Maximization, caused by large reward margins. Informed by these insights, we introduce a novel solution named Policy-Guided DPO (PG-DPO), combining Adaptive Rejection Scaling (ARS) and Implicit Preference Regularization (IPR) to effectively mitigate likelihood displacement. Experiments show that PG-DPO outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, offering a robust solution for improving preference alignment in video generation tasks.

Each instance is annotated with 3D bounding box, class label, and instance identity, supporting tasks such as 3D object detection, 3D multi-object tracking (MOT), and 6-DoF pose estimation. Besides, we establish the LAA3D Benchmark, integrating multiple tasks and methods with unified evaluation protocols for comparison.

*Qiyang Yu,Yu Fang,Tianrui Li,Xuemei Cao,Yan Chen,Jianghao Li,Fan Min,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Grc-SAM, a coarse-to-fine framework for improving image segmentation without prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in prompt-free image segmentation models, namely lacking autonomous region localization and limited scalability in fine-grained modeling.

Method: The proposed Grc-SAM framework uses granular computing principles, integrating multi-granularity attention for coarse foreground localization and fine modeling with sparse local swin-style attention.

Result: Grc-SAM achieves superior segmentation accuracy and scalability compared to baseline methods, as shown by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Grc-SAM offers innovative techniques for prompt-free image segmentation, blending granular computing with vision transformers for effective and precise segmentation.

Abstract: Prompt-free image segmentation aims to generate accurate masks without manual guidance. Typical pre-trained models, notably Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), generate prompts directly at a single granularity level. However, this approach has two limitations: (1) Localizability, lacking mechanisms for autonomous region localization; (2) Scalability, limited fine-grained modeling at high resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce Granular Computing-driven SAM (Grc-SAM), a coarse-to-fine framework motivated by Granular Computing (GrC). First, the coarse stage adaptively extracts high-response regions from features to achieve precise foreground localization and reduce reliance on external prompts. Second, the fine stage applies finer patch partitioning with sparse local swin-style attention to enhance detail modeling and enable high-resolution segmentation. Third, refined masks are encoded as latent prompt embeddings for the SAM decoder, replacing handcrafted prompts with an automated reasoning process. By integrating multi-granularity attention, Grc-SAM bridges granular computing with vision transformers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Grc-SAM outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and scalability. It offers a unique granular computational perspective for prompt-free segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved training scheme for the MeanFlow generative model, focused on effectively learning instantaneous and average velocity fields for faster and high-quality outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address unclear training dynamics in MeanFlow generative modeling and to enhance its efficiency and generative performance.

Method: The study analyzes the interactions between instantaneous and average velocity fields, observing their dependencies and effects. An optimized training strategy is proposed to accelerate instantaneous velocity formation and systematically transition into long-interval average velocity learning.

Result: The optimized training approach achieves faster convergence, significantly improving few-step generation quality. For example, it achieves an FID score of 2.87 on ImageNet 256x256 with 1-NFE, surpassing the conventional baseline (FID 3.43). Additionally, it either reduces training time by 2.5x or uses a smaller backbone for similar performance.

Conclusion: The new training method successfully enhances the efficiency and quality of MeanFlow modeling while providing significant computational savings.

Abstract: MeanFlow promises high-quality generative modeling in few steps, by jointly learning instantaneous and average velocity fields. Yet, the underlying training dynamics remain unclear. We analyze the interaction between the two velocities and find: (i) well-established instantaneous velocity is a prerequisite for learning average velocity; (ii) learning of instantaneous velocity benefits from average velocity when the temporal gap is small, but degrades as the gap increases; and (iii) task-affinity analysis indicates that smooth learning of large-gap average velocities, essential for one-step generation, depends on the prior formation of accurate instantaneous and small-gap average velocities. Guided by these observations, we design an effective training scheme that accelerates the formation of instantaneous velocity, then shifts emphasis from short- to long-interval average velocity. Our enhanced MeanFlow training yields faster convergence and significantly better few-step generation: With the same DiT-XL backbone, our method reaches an impressive FID of 2.87 on 1-NFE ImageNet 256x256, compared to 3.43 for the conventional MeanFlow baseline. Alternatively, our method matches the performance of the MeanFlow baseline with 2.5x shorter training time, or with a smaller DiT-L backbone.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method named DynaMix for generalizable person re-identification, effectively combining multi-camera and single-camera data to outperform current state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the ability of person re-identification systems to recognize individuals across unseen cameras and environments by addressing challenges related to limited labeled multi-camera data and the noise in pseudo-labeled data.

Method: The method introduces DynaMix, which consists of three components: a Relabeling Module for refining pseudo-labels, an Efficient Centroids Module for robust identity representation, and a Data Sampling Module for balanced and diverse batch compositions. It operates at scale with millions of images.

Result: The experiments show that DynaMix achieves superior performance compared to existing methods in generalizable person re-identification tasks.

Conclusion: DynaMix is an effective solution for large-scale generalizable person Re-ID, leveraging dynamic data structures and noise management, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Generalizable person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across unseen cameras and environments. While existing methods rely heavily on limited labeled multi-camera data, we propose DynaMix, a novel method that effectively combines manually labeled multi-camera and large-scale pseudo-labeled single-camera data. Unlike prior works, DynaMix dynamically adapts to the structure and noise of the training data through three core components: (1) a Relabeling Module that refines pseudo-labels of single-camera identities on-the-fly; (2) an Efficient Centroids Module that maintains robust identity representations under a large identity space; and (3) a Data Sampling Module that carefully composes mixed data mini-batches to balance learning complexity and intra-batch diversity. All components are specifically designed to operate efficiently at scale, enabling effective training on millions of images and hundreds of thousands of identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizable person Re-ID.

*Fangda Chen,Jintao Tang,Pancheng Wang,Ting Wang,Shasha Li,Ting Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEAP-3DSAM enhances SAM for 3D medical image segmentation by improving spatial features and automating prompt generation, showing state-of-the-art results on abdominal tumor datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome SAM's limitations in 3D medical image segmentation due to spatial feature loss and reliance on manual prompts, which hinder practical application.

Method: DEAP-3DSAM introduces a Feature Enhanced Decoder to boost spatial features and a Dual Attention Prompter to automate prompt generation using Spatial and Channel Attention.

Result: DEAP-3DSAM demonstrates superior performance in 3D medical image segmentation across four abdominal tumor datasets compared to manual prompt methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DEAP-3DSAM effectively enhances segmentation accuracy and eliminates manual prompting needs, proving its utility for automated 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently demonstrated significant potential in medical image segmentation. Although SAM is primarily trained on 2D images, attempts have been made to apply it to 3D medical image segmentation. However, the pseudo 3D processing used to adapt SAM results in spatial feature loss, limiting its performance. Additionally, most SAM-based methods still rely on manual prompts, which are challenging to implement in real-world scenarios and require extensive external expert knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce the Decoder Enhanced and Auto Prompt SAM (DEAP-3DSAM) to tackle these limitations. Specifically, we propose a Feature Enhanced Decoder that fuses the original image features with rich and detailed spatial information to enhance spatial features. We also design a Dual Attention Prompter to automatically obtain prompt information through Spatial Attention and Channel Attention. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four public abdominal tumor segmentation datasets. The results indicate that our DEAP-3DSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D image segmentation, outperforming or matching existing manual prompt methods. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

*Jichao Chen,YangYang Qu,Ruibo Tang,Dirk Slock*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphPose-Fi introduces a WiFi-based human pose estimation framework that models skeletal topology using a graph-based approach, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WiFi-based HPE aims to avoid issues like occlusion and privacy concerns present in camera-based systems. However, most existing WiFi-based approaches do not account for the skeletal topological relationships, limiting their accuracy.

Method: GraphPose-Fi uses a shared CNN encoder for feature extraction, a lightweight attention module for dynamic reweighting, and a graph-based regression head combining GCN layers with self-attention to model human joint relationships.

Result: The proposed framework achieves significant improvement in 3D human pose estimation performance over existing methods on the MM-Fi dataset across various experimental setups.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling skeletal topology and incorporating graph-based approaches make GraphPose-Fi more accurate and efficient for WiFi-based 3D human pose estimation than previous methods.

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation (HPE) has attracted increasing attention due to its resilience to occlusion and privacy-preserving compared to camera-based methods. However, existing WiFi-based HPE approaches often employ regression networks that directly map WiFi channel state information (CSI) to 3D joint coordinates, ignoring the inherent topological relationships among human joints. In this paper, we present GraphPose-Fi, a graph-based framework that explicitly models skeletal topology for WiFi-based 3D HPE. Our framework comprises a CNN encoder shared across antennas for subcarrier-time feature extraction, a lightweight attention module that adaptively reweights features over time and across antennas, and a graph-based regression head that combines GCN layers with self-attention to capture local topology and global dependencies. Our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods on the MM-Fi dataset in various settings. The source code is available at: https://github.com/Cirrick/GraphPose-Fi.

*Mohan Ramesh,Mark Azer,Fabian B. Flohr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HABIT, a benchmark integrating real human motion into autonomous driving simulations, exposing limitations in current systems and enhancing pedestrian-aware AI research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving simulations lack adequate representation of realistic and diverse human pedestrian behavior, which is vital for ensuring safety and reliability.

Method: The authors developed HABIT, which integrates real-world human motion from mocap and videos into CARLA using a physically consistent motion retargeting pipeline, curating 4,730 traffic-compatible motions. It uses safety metrics and automated scenario generation for robust evaluation.

Result: HABIT revealed significant failure modes in autonomous driving agents missed by prior evaluations, such as higher collision rates, injury risks, and unnecessary braking in certain scenarios.

Conclusion: HABIT provides a more realistic and rigorous evaluation of autonomous driving systems, highlighting the need for improved pedestrian-aware planning. All resources are made publicly available for advancing AI research.

Abstract: Current autonomous driving (AD) simulations are critically limited by their inadequate representation of realistic and diverse human behavior, which is essential for ensuring safety and reliability. Existing benchmarks often simplify pedestrian interactions, failing to capture complex, dynamic intentions and varied responses critical for robust system deployment. To overcome this, we introduce HABIT (Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic), a high-fidelity simulation benchmark. HABIT integrates real-world human motion, sourced from mocap and videos, into CARLA (Car Learning to Act, a full autonomous driving simulator) via a modular, extensible, and physically consistent motion retargeting pipeline. From an initial pool of approximately 30,000 retargeted motions, we curate 4,730 traffic-compatible pedestrian motions, standardized in SMPL format for physically consistent trajectories. HABIT seamlessly integrates with CARLA's Leaderboard, enabling automated scenario generation and rigorous agent evaluation. Our safety metrics, including Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and False Positive Braking Rate (FPBR), reveal critical failure modes in state-of-the-art AD agents missed by prior evaluations. Evaluating three state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents, InterFuser, TransFuser, and BEVDriver, demonstrates how HABIT exposes planner weaknesses that remain hidden in scripted simulations. Despite achieving close or equal to zero collisions per kilometer on the CARLA Leaderboard, the autonomous agents perform notably worse on HABIT, with up to 7.43 collisions/km and a 12.94% AIS 3+ injury risk, and they brake unnecessarily in up to 33% of cases. All components are publicly released to support reproducible, pedestrian-aware AI research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces DiffSeg30k, a dataset created for fine-grained localization of diffusion-based image edits, addressing the limitations of binary whole-image classification methods used in current AI-generated content detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the detection and localization of diffusion-based image edits, moving from binary classification to more precise semantic segmentation, as existing methods poorly handle localized edits and fail to generalize well.

Method: The authors developed DiffSeg30k, a diverse dataset containing 30k diffusion-edited images with pixel-level annotations, created using various in-the-wild image sources, multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models, and realistic, multi-turn editing workflows.

Result: Three baseline segmentation approaches were benchmarked. The findings highlight the difficulty for models in achieving robust segmentation under image distortions, but also their effectiveness in whole-image classification surpassing traditional forgery detectors.

Conclusion: DiffSeg30k advances fine-grained localization in identifying AI-generated content and demonstrates the potential of segmentation models, while exposing their specific limitations. This dataset sets a benchmark for future research in this area.

Abstract: Diffusion-based editing enables realistic modification of local image regions, making AI-generated content harder to detect. Existing AIGC detection benchmarks focus on classifying entire images, overlooking the localization of diffusion-based edits. We introduce DiffSeg30k, a publicly available dataset of 30k diffusion-edited images with pixel-level annotations, designed to support fine-grained detection. DiffSeg30k features: 1) In-the-wild images--we collect images or image prompts from COCO to reflect real-world content diversity; 2) Diverse diffusion models--local edits using eight SOTA diffusion models; 3) Multi-turn editing--each image undergoes up to three sequential edits to mimic real-world sequential editing; and 4) Realistic editing scenarios--a vision-language model (VLM)-based pipeline automatically identifies meaningful regions and generates context-aware prompts covering additions, removals, and attribute changes. DiffSeg30k shifts AIGC detection from binary classification to semantic segmentation, enabling simultaneous localization of edits and identification of the editing models. We benchmark three baseline segmentation approaches, revealing significant challenges in semantic segmentation tasks, particularly concerning robustness to image distortions. Experiments also reveal that segmentation models, despite being trained for pixel-level localization, emerge as highly reliable whole-image classifiers of diffusion edits, outperforming established forgery classifiers while showing great potential in cross-generator generalization. We believe DiffSeg30k will advance research in fine-grained localization of AI-generated content by demonstrating the promise and limitations of segmentation-based methods.

### [412] [3M-TI: High-Quality Mobile Thermal Imaging via Calibration-free Multi-Camera Cross-Modal Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19117)
*Minchong Chen,Xiaoyun Yuan,Junzhe Wan,Jianing Zhang,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3M-TI is a novel framework enhancing thermal imaging by leveraging RGB data without requiring camera calibration, improving resolution and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile thermal sensors suffer from low spatial resolution and poor image quality. Existing super-resolution methods face limitations in recovering structural detail or require complex camera calibration, which is impractical for real-world applications.

Method: The framework, called 3M-TI, integrates a cross-modal self-attention module (CSM) into a diffusion UNet architecture. This method adaptively aligns thermal and RGB features during processing, bypassing the need for explicit camera calibration and leveraging generative priors for enhancing thermal images.

Result: 3M-TI achieves state-of-the-art results in thermal image quality and quantitative metrics. It also significantly boosts performance in downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation.

Conclusion: 3M-TI offers a practical, calibration-free solution for improving thermal imaging in mobile systems, with superior results in both image enhancement and related applications.

Abstract: The miniaturization of thermal sensors for mobile platforms inherently limits their spatial resolution and textural fidelity, leading to blurry and less informative images. Existing thermal super-resolution (SR) methods can be grouped into single-image and RGB-guided approaches: the former struggles to recover fine structures from limited information, while the latter relies on accurate and laborious cross-camera calibration, which hinders practical deployment and robustness. Here, we propose 3M-TI, a calibration-free Multi-camera cross-Modality diffusion framework for Mobile Thermal Imaging. At its core, 3M-TI integrates a cross-modal self-attention module (CSM) into the diffusion UNet, replacing the original self-attention layers to adaptively align thermal and RGB features throughout the denoising process, without requiring explicit camera calibration. This design enables the diffusion network to leverage its generative prior to enhance spatial resolution, structural fidelity, and texture detail in the super-resolved thermal images. Extensive evaluations on real-world mobile thermal cameras and public benchmarks validate our superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. More importantly, the thermal images enhanced by 3M-TI lead to substantial gains in critical downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, underscoring its practical value for robust mobile thermal perception systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MonoSR, a new dataset for monocular spatial reasoning spanning diverse scenarios, evaluates current models, and provides guidance for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial reasoning research is limited to indoor environments and multi-view setups, which are less applicable to outdoor scenarios using monocular images.

Method: The authors created MonoSR, a large-scale dataset supporting various scenarios and question types, and tested advanced vision-language models on spatial reasoning tasks.

Result: Findings highlight limitations of existing models and the importance of auxiliary information for improving spatial reasoning in monocular setups.

Conclusion: MonoSR serves as a platform to advance spatial reasoning in open-world environments while offering insights for future model development.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning (SR), the ability to infer 3D spatial information from 2D inputs, is essential for real-world applications such as embodied AI and autonomous driving. However, existing research primarily focuses on indoor environments and typically relies on multi-view observations, which limits their generalizability to outdoor scenarios and constrains their applicability to monocular images, the most common real-world setting. In this work, we propose MonoSR, a large-scale monocular spatial reasoning dataset that spans diverse scenarios including indoor, outdoor, and object-centric settings, and supports multiple question types. MonoSR provides a path toward open-world monocular spatial reasoning. Beyond introducing the dataset, we evaluate advanced vision-language models to reveal their limitations on this challenging task. We further analyze whether auxiliary information is crucial for monocular spatial reasoning and offer practical guidance for designing future models. These contributions collectively establish a foundation for advancing monocular spatial reasoning in real-world, open-world environments.

*Beilin Chu,Weike You,Mengtao Li,Tingting Zheng,Kehan Zhao,Xuan Xu,Zhigao Lu,Jia Song,Moxuan Xu,Linna Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of detecting AI-generated images by leveraging a semantic-antagonistic fine-tuning approach to improve generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the robustness and generalization of detectors for AI-generated images, as existing methods relying on semantic cues often fail under distribution shifts.

Method: The method involves a Patch Shuffle technique to disrupt global semantics, thereby targeting artifact cues, and a fine-tuning framework called SemAnti that freezes semantic subspaces while adapting artifact-sensitive layers.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization on benchmarks such as AIGCDetectBenchmark and GenImage.

Conclusion: Regulating semantics is critical for enhancing AI-generated image detection systems, and the proposed approach effectively leverages this principle with strong empirical results.

Abstract: The rapid progress of GANs and Diffusion Models poses new challenges for detecting AI-generated images. Although CLIP-based detectors exhibit promising generalization, they often rely on semantic cues rather than generator artifacts, leading to brittle performance under distribution shifts. In this work, we revisit the nature of semantic bias and uncover that Patch Shuffle provides an unusually strong benefit for CLIP, that disrupts global semantic continuity while preserving local artifact cues, which reduces semantic entropy and homogenizes feature distributions between natural and synthetic images. Through a detailed layer-wise analysis, we further show that CLIP's deep semantic structure functions as a regulator that stabilizes cross-domain representations once semantic bias is suppressed. Guided by these findings, we propose SemAnti, a semantic-antagonistic fine-tuning paradigm that freezes the semantic subspace and adapts only artifact-sensitive layers under shuffled semantics. Despite its simplicity, SemAnti achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization on AIGCDetectBenchmark and GenImage, demonstrating that regulating semantics is key to unlocking CLIP's full potential for robust AI-generated image detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses small object detection challenges in UAV imagery, proposing MambaRefine-YOLO with novel fusion and feature aggregation modules to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object detection in UAV imagery faces challenges due to low resolution and cluttered backgrounds, necessitating better solutions, particularly through RGB and IR data fusion.

Method: It introduces the Dual-Gated Complementary Mamba fusion module (DGC-MFM) for adaptive RGB-IR data balance and the Hierarchical Feature Aggregation Neck (HFAN) for refined multi-scale feature enhancement.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an mAP of 83.2% on the DroneVehicle dataset (a 7.9% improvement) and significant gains on the VisDrone dataset using single modality.

Conclusion: MambaRefine-YOLO offers a balanced approach to accuracy and efficiency for UAV applications, effectively addressing detection challenges.

Abstract: Small object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery is a persistent challenge, hindered by low resolution and background clutter. While fusing RGB and infrared (IR) data offers a promising solution, existing methods often struggle with the trade-off between effective cross-modal interaction and computational efficiency. In this letter, we introduce MambaRefine-YOLO. Its core contributions are a Dual-Gated Complementary Mamba fusion module (DGC-MFM) that adaptively balances RGB and IR modalities through illumination-aware and difference-aware gating mechanisms, and a Hierarchical Feature Aggregation Neck (HFAN) that uses a ``refine-then-fuse'' strategy to enhance multi-scale features. Our comprehensive experiments validate this dual-pronged approach. On the dual-modality DroneVehicle dataset, the full model achieves a state-of-the-art mAP of 83.2%, an improvement of 7.9% over the baseline. On the single-modality VisDrone dataset, a variant using only the HFAN also shows significant gains, demonstrating its general applicability. Our work presents a superior balance between accuracy and speed, making it highly suitable for real-world UAV applications.

TL;DR: FilmSceneDesigner introduces automated film set design using natural language descriptions and an agent-based framework, generating accurate cinematic scenes through procedural processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional film set design is expert-driven, labor-intensive, and time-consuming; the paper aims to automate and streamline this process.

Method: The system uses an agent-based chaining framework with prompt strategies for parameter generation, combined with a procedural generation pipeline for scene creation using dedicated functions and a curated dataset of film-specific assets.

Result: FilmSceneDesigner generates structurally sound and cinematically realistic scenes efficiently, supported by experimental results and human evaluations.

Conclusion: This system automates film set design, producing high-quality scenes that benefit downstream tasks like virtual previewing, construction drawing, and mood board creation.

Abstract: Film set design plays a pivotal role in cinematic storytelling and shaping the visual atmosphere. However, the traditional process depends on expert-driven manual modeling, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we introduce FilmSceneDesigner, an automated scene generation system that emulates professional film set design workflow. Given a natural language description, including scene type, historical period, and style, we design an agent-based chaining framework to generate structured parameters aligned with film set design workflow, guided by prompt strategies that ensure parameter accuracy and coherence. On the other hand, we propose a procedural generation pipeline which executes a series of dedicated functions with the structured parameters for floorplan and structure generation, material assignment, door and window placement, and object retrieval and layout, ultimately constructing a complete film scene from scratch. Moreover, to enhance cinematic realism and asset diversity, we construct SetDepot-Pro, a curated dataset of 6,862 film-specific 3D assets and 733 materials. Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate that our system produces structurally sound scenes with strong cinematic fidelity, supporting downstream tasks such as virtual previs, construction drawing and mood board creation.

*Dongha Lee,Jinhee Park,Minjun Kim,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABM-LoRA is a novel initialization strategy for low-rank adapters that improves convergence and reduces information loss during downstream training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's random initialization hampers early convergence due to mismatched tangent spaces, leading to significant information loss.

Method: ABM-LoRA aligns the adapter's activation boundaries with the pretrained model before training, enhancing gradient projection into the adapter subspace.

Result: ABM-LoRA improves convergence speed, lowers starting loss, and achieves high performance across language, dialogue, and vision tasks, excelling in structured reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: ABM-LoRA is a significant improvement for low-rank adapter initialization, offering better training efficiency and superior task performance.

Abstract: We propose Activation Boundary Matching for Low-Rank Adaptation (ABM-LoRA), a principled initialization strategy that substantially accelerates the convergence of low-rank adapters. While LoRA offers high parameter efficiency, its random initialization restricts gradient updates to a mismatched tangent space, causing significant information loss and hindering early convergence. Our ABM-LoRA addresses this by aligning the adapter's activation boundaries with those of the pretrained model before downstream training, thereby maximizing the projection of full-parameter gradients into the adapter subspace. This alignment sharply reduces information loss at initialization, yields a lower starting loss, and accelerates convergence. We demonstrate ABM-LoRA's effectiveness across diverse architectures and tasks: language understanding (T5-Base on GLUE), dialogue generation (LLaMA2-7B on WizardLM), and vision recognition (ViT-B/16 on VTAB-1K). On VTAB-1K, it achieves the highest accuracy among all methods, with strong gains on structured reasoning tasks requiring geometric understanding.

*Huisoo Lee,Jisu Han,Hyunsouk Cho,Wonjun Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework, CoMA, for Source-Free Domain Adaptation by leveraging two complementary Foundation Models to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of single Foundation Models in Source-Free Domain Adaptation, which fail to capture diverse contextual cues under domain shifts.

Method: The CoMA framework uses two Foundation Models (like CLIP and BLIP) with distinct properties and employs a bidirectional adaptation mechanism with Decomposed Mutual Information to ensure stable and effective adaptation.

Result: CoMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various settings (closed-set, partial-set, open-set) across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The complementary use of multiple Foundation Models enhances SFDA, making CoMA a superior and robust approach for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without access to source data. Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs) have introduced new opportunities for leveraging external semantic knowledge to guide SFDA. However, relying on a single FM is often insufficient, as it tends to bias adaptation toward a restricted semantic coverage, failing to capture diverse contextual cues under domain shift. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Collaborative Multi-foundation Adaptation (CoMA) framework that jointly leverages two different FMs (e.g., CLIP and BLIP) with complementary properties to capture both global semantics and local contextual cues. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional adaptation mechanism that (1) aligns different FMs with the target model for task adaptation while maintaining their semantic distinctiveness, and (2) transfers complementary knowledge from the FMs to the target model. To ensure stable adaptation under mini-batch training, we introduce Decomposed Mutual Information (DMI) that selectively enhances true dependencies while suppressing false dependencies arising from incomplete class coverage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SFDA methods across four benchmarks, including Office-31, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, and VisDA, under the closed-set setting, while also achieving best results on partial-set and open-set variants.

*Bingchen Li,Xin Li,Jiaqi Xu,Jiaming Guo,Wenbo Li,Renjing Pei,Zhibo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new approach called Test-Time Preference Optimization (TTPO) to enhance image restoration results by aligning them with human preferences using an innovative training-free, three-stage pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image restoration models often fail to produce results favored by humans due to limitations in aligning results with human preferences. Additionally, there's a need for flexible methods to improve restoration quality without retraining models or collecting extensive preference data.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage TTPO pipeline: (1) create candidate images using diffusion inversion and denoising based on initial restorations, (2) select preferred and dispreferred images using automated metrics or human input, and (3) use selected preference images as rewards to optimize the diffusion denoising process for better alignment with human preferences.

Result: Extensive experiments show that TTPO improves perceptual quality across various image restoration tasks and is adaptable to different models without requiring training.

Conclusion: TTPO is effective at enhancing image restoration output, ensuring flexibility, and improving alignment with human preferences, offering a training-free solution applicable to any IR model backbone.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) models are typically trained to recover high-quality images using L1 or LPIPS loss. To handle diverse unknown degradations, zero-shot IR methods have also been introduced. However, existing pre-trained and zero-shot IR approaches often fail to align with human preferences, resulting in restored images that may not be favored. This highlights the critical need to enhance restoration quality and adapt flexibly to various image restoration tasks or backbones without requiring model retraining and ideally without labor-intensive preference data collection. In this paper, we propose the first Test-Time Preference Optimization (TTPO) paradigm for image restoration, which enhances perceptual quality, generates preference data on-the-fly, and is compatible with any IR model backbone. Specifically, we design a training-free, three-stage pipeline: (i) generate candidate preference images online using diffusion inversion and denoising based on the initially restored image; (ii) select preferred and dispreferred images using automated preference-aligned metrics or human feedback; and (iii) use the selected preference images as reward signals to guide the diffusion denoising process, optimizing the restored image to better align with human preferences. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed pipeline.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting and its derivatives have achieved significant breakthroughs in large-scale scene reconstruction. However, how to efficiently and stably achieve high-quality geometric fidelity remains a core challenge. To address this issue, we introduce MetroGS, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework for efficient and robust reconstruction in complex urban environments. Our method is built upon a distributed 2D Gaussian Splatting representation as the core foundation, serving as a unified backbone for subsequent modules. To handle potential sparse regions in complex scenes, we propose a structured dense enhancement scheme that utilizes SfM priors and a pointmap model to achieve a denser initialization, while incorporating a sparsity compensation mechanism to improve reconstruction completeness. Furthermore, we design a progressive hybrid geometric optimization strategy that organically integrates monocular and multi-view optimization to achieve efficient and accurate geometric refinement. Finally, to address the appearance inconsistency commonly observed in large-scale scenes, we introduce a depth-guided appearance modeling approach that learns spatial features with 3D consistency, facilitating effective decoupling between geometry and appearance and further enhancing reconstruction stability. Experiments on large-scale urban datasets demonstrate that MetroGS achieves superior geometric accuracy, rendering quality, offering a unified solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction.

*Carsten T. Lüth,Jeremias Traub,Kim-Celine Kahl,Till J. Bungert,Lukas Klein,Lars Krämer,Paul F. Jaeger,Fabian Isensee,Klaus Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces nnActive, an open-source Active Learning framework for 3D biomedical imaging semantic segmentation, addressing evaluation challenges in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the bottleneck of extensive manual annotation requirements in semantic segmentation for 3D biomedical imaging by using targeted Active Learning (AL) to reduce annotation effort.

Method: The proposed nnActive framework includes a large-scale study on diverse datasets, partial annotations in 3D patch-based training, improved random sampling strategies to handle class imbalance, and a novel 'foreground efficiency metric' measuring annotation cost of background regions.

Result: Key findings show that Active Learning methods outperform traditional Random sampling, though task parameters vary in efficacy, Foreground Aware Random sampling is highly robust, and Predictive Entropy is the best-performing but annotation-intensive method.

Conclusion: nnActive offers crucial improvements to the research and application of AL in 3D biomedical imaging with its innovative strategies and open-source availability.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is crucial for various biomedical applications, yet its reliance on large annotated datasets presents a bottleneck due to the high cost and specialized expertise required for manual labeling. Active Learning (AL) aims to mitigate this challenge by querying only the most informative samples, thereby reducing annotation effort. However, in the domain of 3D biomedical imaging, there is no consensus on whether AL consistently outperforms Random sampling. Four evaluation pitfalls hinder the current methodological assessment. These are (1) restriction to too few datasets and annotation budgets, (2) using 2D models on 3D images without partial annotations, (3) Random baseline not being adapted to the task, and (4) measuring annotation cost only in voxels. In this work, we introduce nnActive, an open-source AL framework that overcomes these pitfalls by (1) means of a large scale study spanning four biomedical imaging datasets and three label regimes, (2) extending nnU-Net by using partial annotations for training with 3D patch-based query selection, (3) proposing Foreground Aware Random sampling strategies tackling the foreground-background class imbalance of medical images and (4) propose the foreground efficiency metric, which captures the low annotation cost of background-regions. We reveal the following findings: (A) while all AL methods outperform standard Random sampling, none reliably surpasses an improved Foreground Aware Random sampling; (B) benefits of AL depend on task specific parameters; (C) Predictive Entropy is overall the best performing AL method, but likely requires the most annotation effort; (D) AL performance can be improved with more compute intensive design choices. As a holistic, open-source framework, nnActive can serve as a catalyst for research and application of AL in 3D biomedical imaging. Code is at: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnActive

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLASH, a benchmark for detecting contradictions between multimodal inputs (images and captions) and tests the limitations of state-of-the-art models in recognizing such conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to address the issue of detecting contradictions in real-world multimodal inputs, a critical skill for ensuring system reliability.

Method: Developed the CLASH benchmark based on COCO images with contradictory captions and performed both automated and human verification. Evaluated using multiple-choice and open-ended formats with an emphasis on fine-tuning.

Result: State-of-the-art models struggle with detecting cross-modal contradictions, showing systemic biases and specific category weaknesses.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning models using the CLASH benchmark substantially improves their ability to detect multimodal contradictions, highlighting the benchmark's utility.

Abstract: Contradictory multimodal inputs are common in real-world settings, yet existing benchmarks typically assume input consistency and fail to evaluate cross-modal contradiction detection - a fundamental capability for preventing hallucinations and ensuring reliability. We introduce CLASH, a novel benchmark for multimodal contradiction detection, featuring COCO images paired with contradictory captions containing controlled object-level or attribute-level contradictions. The samples include targeted questions evaluated in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. The benchmark provides an extensive fine-tuning set filtered through automated quality checks, alongside a smaller human-verified diagnostic set. Our analysis of state-of-the-art models reveals substantial limitations in recognizing cross-modal conflicts, exposing systematic modality biases and category-specific weaknesses. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that targeted fine-tuning on CLASH substantially enhances conflict detection capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates vision-language models like CLIP in recognizing objects that resemble but aren't true instances of the given object.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether vision-language models can distinguish between real objects and their lookalikes.

Method: The authors curated the RoLA dataset and utilized prompts and embedding space alterations to improve discrimination abilities in CLIP.

Result: Embedding space adjustments improved cross-modal retrieval on Conceptual12M and enhanced captions visually.

Conclusion: This method boosts understanding of subtle distinctions in computer vision models, aligning them closer to human perception.

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have yielded models with strong performance on recognition benchmarks; however, significant gaps remain in comparison to human perception. One subtle ability is to judge whether an image looks like a given object without being an instance of that object. We study whether vision-language models such as CLIP capture this distinction. We curated a dataset named RoLA (Real or Lookalike) of real and lookalike exemplars (e.g., toys, statues, drawings, pareidolia) across multiple categories, and first evaluate a prompt-based baseline with paired "real"/"lookalike" prompts. We then estimate a direction in CLIP's embedding space that moves representations between real and lookalike. Applying this direction to image and text embeddings improves discrimination in cross-modal retrieval on Conceptual12M, and also enhances captions produced by a CLIP prefix captioner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to enable occlusion culling in 3D Gaussian Splatting by proposing a visibility function learned using a small neural network. It improves rendering efficiency and image quality for complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of semi-transparent Gaussians in 3D Gaussian Splatting, which prevent the use of occlusion culling, thereby reducing rendering efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces an approach to learn viewpoint-dependent visibility using a small shared neural network (MLP) across instances. The learned function is utilized during rendering to discard occluded primitives efficiently.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing techniques in VRAM usage and image quality for complex composed scenes, while being complementary to Level-of-Detail techniques.

Conclusion: Occlusion culling can be effectively implemented within 3D Gaussian Splatting, enhancing rendering efficiency and scene composition capabilities.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting can exploit frustum culling and level-of-detail strategies to accelerate rendering of scenes containing a large number of primitives. However, the semi-transparent nature of Gaussians prevents the application of another highly effective technique: occlusion culling. We address this limitation by proposing a novel method to learn the viewpoint-dependent visibility function of all Gaussians in a trained model using a small, shared MLP across instances of an asset in a scene. By querying it for Gaussians within the viewing frustum prior to rasterization, our method can discard occluded primitives during rendering. Leveraging Tensor Cores for efficient computation, we integrate these neural queries directly into a novel instanced software rasterizer. Our approach outperforms the current state of the art for composed scenes in terms of VRAM usage and image quality, utilizing a combination of our instanced rasterizer and occlusion culling MLP, and exhibits complementary properties to existing LoD techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ReAlign, a method to solve the alignment issues in text-to-motion diffusion models, improving text-motion consistency and motion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion-based models, which causes semantically inconsistent or low-quality motion generation.

Method: The proposed method, ReAlign, utilizes a step-aware reward model during the denoising sampling process and guides the diffusion process using a reward-based strategy. It combines text-aligned and motion-aligned modules to refine noisy motions at each step.

Result: ReAlign achieves notable improvement in text-motion alignment and motion quality in experiments on both motion generation and retrieval tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ReAlign effectively enhances the semantic consistency and realism of 3D human motions generated from text, making it a promising approach for improving text-to-motion generation systems.

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from text inputs, holds immense potential for applications in gaming, film, and robotics. Recently, diffusion-based methods have been shown to generate more diversity and realistic motion. However, there exists a misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, which leads to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address this limitation, we propose Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign), comprising a step-aware reward model to assess alignment quality during the denoising sampling and a reward-guided strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density and alignment. Extensive experiments of both motion generation and retrieval tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates visual grounding in four state-of-the-art models (Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.0) using Italian medical visual questions, revealing significant variability in reliance on visual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether advanced vision language models genuinely integrate visual and textual information in medical tasks.

Method: Models were tested on the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset with 60 image-dependent questions, replacing correct medical images with blank placeholders to measure reliance on visual input.

Result: GPT-4o showed strong visual dependency (accuracy drop: 27.9pp), while Claude, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini displayed modest drops (8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp, respectively). Models often relied on textual shortcuts rather than true visual analysis.

Conclusion: The study highlights variability in model robustness and the necessity for thorough evaluation of visual grounding before clinical application.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on medical visual question answering benchmarks, yet their reliance on visual information remains unclear. We investigate whether frontier VLMs demonstrate genuine visual grounding when answering Italian medical questions by testing four state-of-the-art models: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini 2.0 flash exp. Using 60 questions from the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset that explicitly require image interpretation, we substitute correct medical images with blank placeholders to test whether models truly integrate visual and textual information. Our results reveal striking variability in visual dependency: GPT-4o shows the strongest visual grounding with a 27.9pp accuracy drop (83.2% [74.6%, 91.7%] to 55.3% [44.1%, 66.6%]), while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude maintain high accuracy with modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively. Analysis of model-generated reasoning reveals confident explanations for fabricated visual interpretations across all models, suggesting varying degrees of reliance on textual shortcuts versus genuine visual analysis. These findings highlight critical differences in model robustness and the need for rigorous evaluation before clinical deployment.

TL;DR: Percept-WAM enhances spatial perception for autonomous driving by integrating 2D and 3D understanding in a unified vision-language model, outperforming classical methods and improving planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving suffers from failures due to inaccurate spatial perception and instability in complex scenarios. Current vision-language models lack robust spatial grounding and localization capabilities.

Method: Percept-WAM introduces a novel unified model integrating 2D/3D understanding using World-PV and World-BEV tokens for stable and accurate object perception. It employs grid-conditioned prediction, IoU-aware scoring, and parallel autoregressive decoding.

Result: The model achieves competitive performance on perception benchmarks (e.g., 51.7/58.9 mAP on COCO and nuScenes) and enhances trajectory planning metrics, surpassing existing methods in generalization and open-vocabulary tasks.

Conclusion: Percept-WAM effectively addresses spatial perception challenges in autonomous driving, combining general intelligence, robust perception, and improved trajectory planning capabilities.

Abstract: Autonomous driving heavily relies on accurate and robust spatial perception. Many failures arise from inaccuracies and instability, especially in long-tail scenarios and complex interactions. However, current vision-language models are weak at spatial grounding and understanding, and VLA systems built on them therefore show limited perception and localization ability. To address these challenges, we introduce Percept-WAM, a perception-enhanced World-Awareness-Action Model that is the first to implicitly integrate 2D/3D scene understanding abilities within a single vision-language model (VLM). Instead of relying on QA-style spatial reasoning, Percept-WAM unifies 2D/3D perception tasks into World-PV and World-BEV tokens, which encode both spatial coordinates and confidence. We propose a grid-conditioned prediction mechanism for dense object perception, incorporating IoU-aware scoring and parallel autoregressive decoding, improving stability in long-tail, far-range, and small-object scenarios. Additionally, Percept-WAM leverages pretrained VLM parameters to retain general intelligence (e.g., logical reasoning) and can output perception results and trajectory control outputs directly. Experiments show that Percept-WAM matches or surpasses classical detectors and segmenters on downstream perception benchmarks, achieving 51.7/58.9 mAP on COCO 2D detection and nuScenes BEV 3D detection. When integrated with trajectory decoders, it further improves planning performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM, e.g., surpassing DiffusionDrive by 2.1 in PMDS on NAVSIM. Qualitative results further highlight its strong open-vocabulary and long-tail generalization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiT-Mem, a memory encoder designed to enhance video generation models by embedding world knowledge, improving visual fidelity and adherence to physical rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformer-based video generation models lack explicit world knowledge, leading to violations of physical rules and commonsense dynamics.

Method: The study introduces DiT-Mem, a learnable memory encoder comprising 3D CNNs, filters, and self-attention, enabling targeted guidance and efficient training by injecting memory tokens into DiT self-attention layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved physical rule adherence and video quality on state-of-the-art models using a few training parameters and minimal data.

Conclusion: DiT-Mem improves video generation with plug-and-play memory that enables better adherence to physical dynamics and higher video fidelity.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer(DiT) based video generation models have recently achieved impressive visual quality and temporal coherence, but they still frequently violate basic physical laws and commonsense dynamics, revealing a lack of explicit world knowledge. In this work, we explore how to equip them with a plug-and-play memory that injects useful world knowledge. Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving physical rule following and video fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDSplat introduces a self-supervised framework for reconstructing driving scenes, focusing on instance decomposition and motion trajectory learning without human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in dynamic scene reconstruction, specifically the reliance on annotations or intertwined static and dynamic elements in object representations.

Method: The proposed IDSplat framework uses instance decomposition via language-grounded video tracking anchored in 3D lidar data and smooths motion trajectories with a coordinated-turn scheme.

Result: Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset showed competitive reconstructions, effective instance-level decomposition, and generalizability across sequences without retraining.

Conclusion: IDSplat provides a scalable and annotation-free approach for dynamic scene reconstruction, suitable for autonomous driving applications, with an emphasis on instance decomposition and motion trajectory accuracy.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes is essential for developing autonomous systems through sensor-realistic simulation. Although recent methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, they either rely on costly human annotations for object trajectories or use time-varying representations without explicit object-level decomposition, leading to intertwined static and dynamic elements that hinder scene separation. We present IDSplat, a self-supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reconstructs dynamic scenes with explicit instance decomposition and learnable motion trajectories, without requiring human annotations. Our key insight is to model dynamic objects as coherent instances undergoing rigid transformations, rather than unstructured time-varying primitives. For instance decomposition, we employ zero-shot, language-grounded video tracking anchored to 3D using lidar, and estimate consistent poses via feature correspondences. We introduce a coordinated-turn smoothing scheme to obtain temporally and physically consistent motion trajectories, mitigating pose misalignments and tracking failures, followed by joint optimization of object poses and Gaussian parameters. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive reconstruction quality while maintaining instance-level decomposition and generalizes across diverse sequences and view densities without retraining, making it practical for large-scale autonomous driving applications. Code will be released.

TL;DR: This paper examines vulnerabilities in cargo-occupancy classifiers under physical adversarial attacks using simulations in 3D environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the security risks in automated logistics systems by exploring the feasibility of physical adversarial attacks.

Method: The study used Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering to optimize adversarial patches across geometry, lighting, and viewpoint variations and compared results to a 2D baseline.

Result: 3D-optimized adversarial patches achieved 84.94% attack success (empty to full) and 30.32% in concealment attacks (full to empty).

Conclusion: Adversarial patch attacks are a feasible threat to logistic systems, underscoring the need for enhancing physical robustness in such systems.

Abstract: Computer vision systems are increasingly adopted in modern logistics operations, including the estimation of trailer occupancy for planning, routing, and billing. Although effective, such systems may be vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patches that can be printed and placed on interior surfaces. In this work, we study the feasibility of such attacks on a convolutional cargo-occupancy classifier using fully simulated 3D environments. Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent. We analyze the factors influencing attack success, discuss implications for the security of automated logistics pipelines, and highlight directions for strengthening physical robustness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate adversarial patch attacks for cargo-occupancy estimation in physically realistic, fully simulated 3D scenes.

*Shuai Wang,Daoan Zhang,Tianyi Bai,Shitong Shao,Jiebo Luo,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LAST, a novel approach to enhance vision-language models (VLMs) for 3D spatial and long video understanding using 2D image inputs, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although VLMs excel at vision-language tasks, they struggle with 3D spatial and long video understanding. Existing methods tackle these issues separately with specialized architectures. There is a need for a unified solution.

Method: The authors propose LAST (LeArn to Think in Space and Time), which fosters visual thinking in both 3D space and time. It does this by building thinking trajectories from 2D image inputs and applies the model in two settings: zero-shot prompting and fine-tuning with training data.

Result: The method demonstrates significant improvements in benchmarks, achieving 15.8% gains in EgoSchema in zero-shot settings with GPT-4o and 8.3% improvement on VSI-Bench over Qwen2.5-VL-7B, alongside enhancements in multiple spatial, video, and image understanding tasks.

Conclusion: LAST showcases the potential of enhancing general VLMs for spatial and temporal reasoning, providing a unified method for 3D and long video understanding, with substantial improvements across varied benchmarks.

Abstract: Humans can perceive and understand 3D space and long videos from sequential visual observations. But do vision-language models (VLMs) can? Recent work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle to understand 3D space and long videos, although they are powerful in typical vision-language tasks. Current methods often rely on specialized architectural designs to improve performance for 3D tasks and video understanding tasks separately. In contrast, we propose LAST, short for LeArn to Think in Space and Time, to jointly improve 3D spatial and long video understanding for general VLMs with only a set of 2D images as inputs. LAST makes VLMs think in space and time rather than only with text before giving the final answer, building visual thinking trajectories in 3D space and temporal dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAST in two scenarios: 1) zero-shot, where we directly prompt proprietary models; and 2) fine-tuning general VLMs with data that include thinking trajectories in 3D space and time. We show that LAST brings substantial gains in various benchmarks, including 3 spatial understanding, 4 video understanding, and 3 image understanding tasks. Notably, 15.8% gains on EgoSchema with GPT-4o in a zero-shot manner and 8.3 gains on VSI-Bench compared with Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

*Dewei Zhou,Mingwei Li,Zongxin Yang,Yu Lu,Yunqiu Xu,Zhizhong Wang,Zeyi Huang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BideDPO, a framework for resolving conflicts in conditional image generation using disentangled preference pairs and adaptive loss balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in conditional image generation struggle with conflicts between conditioning image signals and text prompts, as well as generative model biases.

Method: They propose BideDPO, which uses bidirectionally decoupled preference pairs and employs Adaptive Loss Balancing to address input and model-bias conflicts. An automated data pipeline is also introduced for iterative optimization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that BideDPO improves text success rates (e.g., +35%) and adherence to conditioning signals in text-to-image synthesis.

Conclusion: The BideDPO framework effectively solves conflicts in conditional image generation tasks, significantly enhancing both text and condition alignments.

Abstract: Conditional image generation enhances text-to-image synthesis with structural, spatial, or stylistic priors, but current methods face challenges in handling conflicts between sources. These include 1) input-level conflicts, where the conditioning image contradicts the text prompt, and 2) model-bias conflicts, where generative biases disrupt alignment even when conditions match the text. Addressing these conflicts requires nuanced solutions, which standard supervised fine-tuning struggles to provide. Preference-based optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) show promise but are limited by gradient entanglement between text and condition signals and lack disentangled training data for multi-constraint tasks. To overcome this, we propose a bidirectionally decoupled DPO framework (BideDPO). Our method creates two disentangled preference pairs-one for the condition and one for the text-to reduce gradient entanglement. The influence of pairs is managed using an Adaptive Loss Balancing strategy for balanced optimization. We introduce an automated data pipeline to sample model outputs and generate conflict-aware data. This process is embedded in an iterative optimization strategy that refines both the model and the data. We construct a DualAlign benchmark to evaluate conflict resolution between text and condition. Experiments show BideDPO significantly improves text success rates (e.g., +35%) and condition adherence. We also validate our approach using the COCO dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel core-set selection approach using diffusion models and reconstruction deviation to calculate data likelihood, significantly enhancing subset-selection quality for model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for core-set selection lack direct modeling of data likelihood, potentially missing important distributional structures crucial for effective training.

Method: The authors use diffusion models to estimate data likelihood through reconstruction deviation derived from partial reverse denoising. They introduce a scoring criterion grounded in the ELBO of Markovian diffusion processes, as well as an efficient technique to determine the optimal reconstruction timestep.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet show the approach consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving model performance comparable to full-data training while using only 50% of training data.

Conclusion: The likelihood-informed scoring improves subset selection for model training and provides insights into data distribution and model learning preferences.

Abstract: Existing core-set selection methods predominantly rely on heuristic scoring signals such as training dynamics or model uncertainty, lacking explicit modeling of data likelihood. This omission may hinder the constructed subset from capturing subtle yet critical distributional structures that underpin effective model training. In this work, we propose a novel, theoretically grounded approach that leverages diffusion models to estimate data likelihood via reconstruction deviation induced by partial reverse denoising. Specifically, we establish a formal connection between reconstruction error and data likelihood, grounded in the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of Markovian diffusion processes, thereby enabling a principled, distribution-aware scoring criterion for data selection. Complementarily, we introduce an efficient information-theoretic method to identify the optimal reconstruction timestep, ensuring that the deviation provides a reliable signal indicative of underlying data likelihood. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that reconstruction deviation offers an effective scoring criterion, consistently outperforming existing baselines across selection ratios, and closely matching full-data training using only 50% of the data. Further analysis shows that the likelihood-informed nature of our score reveals informative insights in data selection, shedding light on the interplay between data distributional characteristics and model learning preferences.

### [436] [ReMatch: Boosting Representation through Matching for Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19278)
*Qianying Liu,Xiao Liang,Zhiqiang Zhang,Yibo Chen,Xu Tang,Zhongfei Qing,Fengfan Zhou,Yao Hu,Paul Henderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduced ReMatch, a framework utilizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for advanced multimodal data retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods underutilized Multimodal Large Language Models' generative and compositional reasoning capabilities, relying only on simple encoding.

Method: ReMatch combines end-to-end training of MLLMs with a chat-style generative matching stage, leveraging autoregressive decision-making and instance-wise discrimination for embedding refinement.

Result: ReMatch outperformed previous benchmarks, especially in zero-shot generalization across five datasets, showcasing robustness and transferability.

Conclusion: ReMatch effectively leverages MLLMs' full capabilities, achieving superior performance in multimodal retrieval tasks, highlighting its generative and compositional strengths.

Abstract: We present ReMatch, a framework that leverages the generative strength of MLLMs for multimodal retrieval. Previous approaches treated an MLLM as a simple encoder, ignoring its generative nature, and under-utilising its compositional reasoning and world knowledge. We instead train the embedding MLLM end-to-end with a chat-style generative matching stage. The matching stage uses the same MLLM to autoregressively decide relevance from multi-view inputs, including both raw data and its own projected embeddings for each query and document. It provides instance-wise discrimination supervision that complements a standard contrastive loss, offering stronger gradients on hard negatives and preserving the compositional strengths of the original MLLM. To obtain semantically richer multimodal embeddings, we use multiple learnable tokens to augment each input, generating fine-grained contextual, mutually orthogonal embeddings with low inference cost. Leveraging our established high-performance baseline,we assemble the ideas mentioned above into a powerful training recipe and achieve a new state-of-the-art on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB). Our experiments show particularly strong zero-shot generalization results on five datasets, highlighting the robustness and transferability of ReMatch.

*Phurtivilai Patt,Leyang Huang,Yinqiang Zhang,Yang Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method to improve 3D Gaussian Splatting by using a pre-densified approach with LiDAR and monocular depth data, reducing artifacts and resource inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods suffer from issues like floating artifacts and inefficient resource usage due to reliance on adaptive density control.

Method: A novel pre-densification technique combining sparse LiDAR data with monocular depth estimation and ROI-aware sampling is proposed. This approach avoids adaptive density control, resulting in dense point clouds for better visual and computational performance.

Result: The new method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art techniques while reducing resource consumption and training time, validated through experiments on four new datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves visual quality and efficiency in 3D Gaussian Splatting by addressing limitations in current approaches, particularly in handling complex scenes with regions of interest.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods, particularly their reliance on adaptive density control, which can lead to floating artifacts and inefficient resource usage. We propose a novel densify beforehand approach that enhances the initialization of 3D scenes by combining sparse LiDAR data with monocular depth estimation from corresponding RGB images. Our ROI-aware sampling scheme prioritizes semantically and geometrically important regions, yielding a dense point cloud that improves visual fidelity and computational efficiency. This densify beforehand approach bypasses the adaptive density control that may introduce redundant Gaussians in the original pipeline, allowing the optimization to focus on the other attributes of 3D Gaussian primitives, reducing overlap while enhancing visual quality. Our method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art techniques while significantly lowering resource consumption and training time. We validate our approach through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on four newly collected datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving regions of interest in complex scenes.

*Johannes Meier,Florian Günther,Riccardo Marin,Oussema Dhaouadi,Jacques Kaiser,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in active learning for monocular 3D object detection by proposing IDEAL-M3D, an instance-level selection method driven by diverse ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the heavy annotation cost required for monocular 3D object detection while improving performance under limited labeling budgets.

Method: Proposing IDEAL-M3D, an instance-level active learning pipeline that uses diverse ensembles with heterogeneous backbones, loss weight perturbation, and time-dependent bagging to optimize annotation prioritization.

Result: IDEAL-M3D achieves comparable or superior performance on the KITTI dataset while requiring only 60% of the annotations compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: IDEAL-M3D enhances efficiency and performance in monocular 3D detection, addressing key limitations in active learning and reducing annotation requirements through an innovative instance-level selection approach.

Abstract: Monocular 3D detection relies on just a single camera and is therefore easy to deploy. Yet, achieving reliable 3D understanding from monocular images requires substantial annotation, and 3D labels are especially costly. To maximize performance under constrained labeling budgets, it is essential to prioritize annotating samples expected to deliver the largest performance gains. This prioritization is the focus of active learning. Curiously, we observed two significant limitations in active learning algorithms for 3D monocular object detection. First, previous approaches select entire images, which is inefficient, as non-informative instances contained in the same image also need to be labeled. Secondly, existing methods rely on uncertainty-based selection, which in monocular 3D object detection creates a bias toward depth ambiguity. Consequently, distant objects are selected, while nearby objects are overlooked.
  To address these limitations, we propose IDEAL-M3D, the first instance-level pipeline for monocular 3D detection. For the first time, we demonstrate that an explicitly diverse, fast-to-train ensemble improves diversity-driven active learning for monocular 3D. We induce diversity with heterogeneous backbones and task-agnostic features, loss weight perturbation, and time-dependent bagging. IDEAL-M3D shows superior performance and significant resource savings: with just 60% of the annotations, we achieve similar or better AP3D on KITTI validation and test set results compared to training the same detector on the whole dataset.

### [439] [Dual-Granularity Semantic Prompting for Language Guidance Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19306)
*Zixuan Wang,Haoran Sun,Jiaming Lu,Wenxuan Wang,Zhongling Huang,Dingwen Zhang,Xuelin Qian,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGSPNet is proposed as an infrared small target detection framework combining coarse and fine-grained semantic prompts to enhance accuracy without annotations. Innovative attention mechanisms boost target identification across feature spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in infrared small target detection, including issues of feature representation and background interference, and seeks to improve upon limitations of existing CLIP-inspired methods reliant on inaccurate text descriptions and manual annotations.

Method: The framework, DGSPNet, incorporates dual-granularity semantic prompts by using coarse-grained textual priors and fine-grained descriptions obtained via visual-to-textual mapping. Additionally, mechanisms like TGCA and TGSA are implemented to improve sensitivity to target regions.

Result: The experiments show that DGSPNet achieves significant improvements in detection accuracy and delivers state-of-the-art results across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DGSPNet successfully enhances infrared small target detection by integrating advanced semantic prompts and attention mechanisms, demonstrating its potential to function without annotation dependencies while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection remains challenging due to limited feature representation and severe background interference, resulting in sub-optimal performance. While recent CLIP-inspired methods attempt to leverage textual guidance for detection, they are hindered by inaccurate text descriptions and reliance on manual annotations. To overcome these limitations, we propose DGSPNet, an end-to-end language prompt-driven framework. Our approach integrates dual-granularity semantic prompts: coarse-grained textual priors (e.g., 'infrared image', 'small target') and fine-grained personalized semantic descriptions derived through visual-to-textual mapping within the image space. This design not only facilitates learning fine-grained semantic information but also can inherently leverage language prompts during inference without relying on any annotation requirements. By fully leveraging the precision and conciseness of text descriptions, we further introduce a text-guide channel attention (TGCA) mechanism and text-guide spatial attention (TGSA) mechanism that enhances the model's sensitivity to potential targets across both low- and high-level feature spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves detection accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.

*Xincheng Wang,Hanchi Sun,Wenjun Sun,Kejun Xue,Wangqiu Zhou,Jianbo Zhang,Wei Sun,Dandan Zhu,Xiongkuo Min,Jun Jia,Zhijun Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper assesses dataset watermarking methods for diffusion models and reveals their vulnerabilities while proposing a practical removal method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to tackle copyright and security risks associated with fine-tuned diffusion models by exploring dataset watermarking as a traceability mechanism.

Method: A unified evaluation framework for dataset watermarking is introduced, addressing Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness, alongside proposing a watermark removal method.

Result: Experiments show shortcomings of current watermarking methods under real-world challenges and demonstrate effective watermark removal without affecting fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in existing watermarking approaches and emphasizes the need for more robust future techniques.

Abstract: Recent fine-tuning techniques for diffusion models enable them to reproduce specific image sets, such as particular faces or artistic styles, but also introduce copyright and security risks. Dataset watermarking has been proposed to ensure traceability by embedding imperceptible watermarks into training images, which remain detectable in outputs even after fine-tuning. However, current methods lack a unified evaluation framework. To address this, this paper establishes a general threat model and introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness. Experiments show that existing methods perform well in universality and transmissibility, and exhibit some robustness against common image processing operations, yet still fall short under real-world threat scenarios. To reveal these vulnerabilities, the paper further proposes a practical watermark removal method that fully eliminates dataset watermarks without affecting fine-tuning, highlighting a key challenge for future research.

*Lingwei Dang,Zonghan Li,Juntong Li,Hongwen Zhang,Liang An,Yebin Liu,Qingyao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncMV4D introduces a model for synchronized multi-view HOI video and 4D motion generation, addressing limitations of current single-view and controlled-environment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the realism and applicability of HOI generation by overcoming constraints like single-view distortions and controlled-lab 3D data requirements.

Method: The framework includes two main innovations: Multi-view Joint Diffusion (MJD) for co-generating HOI videos and motions, and Diffusion Points Aligner (DPA) for refining coarse motions into aligned 4D point tracks using a coupled cycle of enhancement.

Result: The method achieves better visual realism, motion plausibility, and multi-view consistency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: SyncMV4D broadens the scope of HOI generation for dynamic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating its potential in animation and robotics applications.

Abstract: Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation plays a critical role in advancing applications across animation and robotics. Current video-based methods are predominantly single-view, which impedes comprehensive 3D geometry perception and often results in geometric distortions or unrealistic motion patterns. While 3D HOI approaches can generate dynamically plausible motions, their dependence on high-quality 3D data captured in controlled laboratory settings severely limits their generalization to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SyncMV4D, the first model that jointly generates synchronized multi-view HOI videos and 4D motions by unifying visual prior, motion dynamics, and multi-view geometry. Our framework features two core innovations: (1) a Multi-view Joint Diffusion (MJD) model that co-generates HOI videos and intermediate motions, and (2) a Diffusion Points Aligner (DPA) that refines the coarse intermediate motion into globally aligned 4D metric point tracks. To tightly couple 2D appearance with 4D dynamics, we establish a closed-loop, mutually enhancing cycle. During the diffusion denoising process, the generated video conditions the refinement of the 4D motion, while the aligned 4D point tracks are reprojected to guide next-step joint generation. Experimentally, our method demonstrates superior performance to state-of-the-art alternatives in visual realism, motion plausibility, and multi-view consistency.

TL;DR: SteadyDancer is a framework for human image animation that ensures the preservation of the first frame's identity while delivering precise motion control, resolving challenges like identity drift and visual artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in human image animation, such as spatio-temporal misalignments, identity drift, and visual artifacts, common in the Reference-to-Video paradigm.

Method: SteadyDancer introduces a Condition-Reconciliation Mechanism to harmonize conditions, Synergistic Pose Modulation Modules for coherent pose representation, and a Staged Decoupled-Objective Training Pipeline for hierarchical optimization.

Result: Experiments show that SteadyDancer achieves advanced levels of appearance fidelity, motion control, and temporal coherence with reduced training requirements.

Conclusion: SteadyDancer sets a new state-of-the-art standard in human image animation with its robust design and efficient training, effectively addressing long-standing issues of fidelity and motion control.

Abstract: Preserving first-frame identity while ensuring precise motion control is a fundamental challenge in human image animation. The Image-to-Motion Binding process of the dominant Reference-to-Video (R2V) paradigm overlooks critical spatio-temporal misalignments common in real-world applications, leading to failures such as identity drift and visual artifacts. We introduce SteadyDancer, an Image-to-Video (I2V) paradigm-based framework that achieves harmonized and coherent animation and is the first to ensure first-frame preservation robustly. Firstly, we propose a Condition-Reconciliation Mechanism to harmonize the two conflicting conditions, enabling precise control without sacrificing fidelity. Secondly, we design Synergistic Pose Modulation Modules to generate an adaptive and coherent pose representation that is highly compatible with the reference image. Finally, we employ a Staged Decoupled-Objective Training Pipeline that hierarchically optimizes the model for motion fidelity, visual quality, and temporal coherence. Experiments demonstrate that SteadyDancer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance fidelity and motion control, while requiring significantly fewer training resources than comparable methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Successful recovery of realistic 3D human motion and forces using MonoMSK, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reconstructing 3D human motion from monocular videos lack realism due to their oversimplified models and physics omissions.

Method: MonoMSK integrates transformer-based learning and physics-based simulation using an anatomically accurate musculoskeletal model.

Result: Experiments show MonoMSK excels in kinematic accuracy and introduces precise kinetics estimation from monocular videos.

Conclusion: MonoMSK bridges advanced machine learning with physics for biomechanically realistic human motion estimation.

Abstract: Reconstructing biomechanically realistic 3D human motion - recovering both kinematics (motion) and kinetics (forces) - is a critical challenge. While marker-based systems are lab-bound and slow, popular monocular methods use oversimplified, anatomically inaccurate models (e.g., SMPL) and ignore physics, fundamentally limiting their biomechanical fidelity. In this work, we introduce MonoMSK, a hybrid framework that bridges data-driven learning and physics-based simulation for biomechanically realistic 3D human motion estimation from monocular video. MonoMSK jointly recovers both kinematics (motions) and kinetics (forces and torques) through an anatomically accurate musculoskeletal model. By integrating transformer-based inverse dynamics with differentiable forward kinematics and dynamics layers governed by ODE-based simulation, MonoMSK establishes a physics-regulated inverse-forward loop that enforces biomechanical causality and physical plausibility. A novel forward-inverse consistency loss further aligns motion reconstruction with the underlying kinetic reasoning. Experiments on BML-MoVi, BEDLAM, and OpenCap show that MonoMSK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in kinematic accuracy, while for the first time enabling precise monocular kinetics estimation.

*Anjie Le,Can Peng,Yuyuan Liu,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel machine unlearning method, POUR, focusing on representation-level forgetting rather than just modifying classifiers, with proven effectiveness and performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods fail to fully remove internal representations' influence, leading to incomplete forgetting.

Method: The paper introduces POUR, utilizing a mathematical framework derived from Neural Collapse theory. It includes orthogonal projections and a Representation Unlearning Score (RUS). Two variants, POUR-P and POUR-D, are presented.

Result: POUR achieved effective unlearning while preserving knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across classification and representation metrics on datasets like CIFAR-10/100 and PathMNIST.

Conclusion: Representation-level unlearning significantly improves forgetting efficacy and knowledge retention. POUR showcases a provably optimal approach for this adjustment.

Abstract: In computer vision, machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific visual concepts or training images without retraining from scratch. Studies show that existing approaches often modify the classifier while leaving internal representations intact, resulting in incomplete forgetting. In this work, we extend the notion of unlearning to the representation level, deriving a three-term interplay between forgetting efficacy, retention fidelity, and class separation. Building on Neural Collapse theory, we show that the orthogonal projection of a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) remains an ETF in a lower dimensional space, yielding a provably optimal forgetting operator. We further introduce the Representation Unlearning Score (RUS) to quantify representation-level forgetting and retention fidelity. Building on this, we introduce POUR (Provably Optimal Unlearning of Representations), a geometric projection method with closed-form (POUR-P) and a feature-level unlearning variant under a distillation scheme (POUR-D). Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and PathMNIST demonstrate that POUR achieves effective unlearning while preserving retained knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art unlearning methods on both classification-level and representation-level metrics.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Syn-GRPO, a reinforcement learning method for improving Multimodal LLM (MLLM) perception by generating high-quality, diverse training data using an online data generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the low data quality problem in RL methods for MLLMs, which limits the exploration and generalization ability of these models.

Method: Syn-GRPO incorporates an online data generator that synthesizes diverse responses for GRPO training, consisting of a data server (asynchronous and efficient synthesis) and a GRPO workflow (supervised with diversity reward).

Result: Experiments on visual perception tasks show that Syn-GRPO significantly enhances data quality and outperforms existing MLLM perception methods.

Conclusion: Syn-GRPO provides a promising solution for scaling long-term self-evolving reinforcement learning and enhancing MLLM perception performance.

Abstract: RL (reinforcement learning) methods (e.g., GRPO) for MLLM (Multimodal LLM) perception ability has attracted wide research interest owing to its remarkable generalization ability. Nevertheless, existing reinforcement learning methods still face the problem of low data quality, where data samples cannot elicit diverse responses from MLLMs, thus restricting the exploration scope for MLLM reinforcement learning. Some methods attempt to mitigate this problem by imposing constraints on entropy, but none address it at its root. Therefore, to tackle this problem, this work proposes Syn-GRPO (Synthesis-GRPO), which employs an online data generator to synthesize high-quality training data with diverse responses in GRPO training. Specifically, Syn-GRPO consists of two components: (1) data server; (2) GRPO workflow. The data server synthesizes new samples from existing ones using an image generation model, featuring a decoupled and asynchronous scheme to achieve high generation efficiency. The GRPO workflow provides the data server with the new image descriptions, and it leverages a diversity reward to supervise the MLLM to predict image descriptions for synthesizing samples with diverse responses. Experiment results across three visual perception tasks demonstrate that Syn-GRPO improves the data quality by a large margin, achieving significant superior performance to existing MLLM perception methods, and Syn-GRPO presents promising potential for scaling long-term self-evolving RL.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a large-scale cell-counting dataset with over 430,000 manually annotated locations and benchmarks various methods for automated cell counting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating accurate automated cell counting systems is challenging because it requires large, high-quality annotated datasets, which are labor-intensive to generate. Existing datasets are limited in size, hindering progress.

Method: The paper provides a new dataset of 3,023 images with detailed annotations, evaluates multiple cell-counting methods, and proposes a SAM-based density-mapping technique (SAM-Counter) for improved performance.

Result: The authors report that their proposed SAM-Counter approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 22.12, outperforming existing methods that have an MAE of 27.46.

Conclusion: The presented dataset and benchmark framework are valuable tools for advancing automated cell counting research, offering a solid platform for future innovations in the field.

Abstract: Accurate cell counting is essential in various biomedical research and clinical applications, including cancer diagnosis, stem cell research, and immunology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, motivating automation through deep learning techniques. However, training reliable deep learning models requires large amounts of high-quality annotated data, which is difficult and time-consuming to produce manually. Consequently, existing cell-counting datasets are often limited, frequently containing fewer than $500$ images. In this work, we introduce a large-scale annotated dataset comprising $3{,}023$ images from immunocytochemistry experiments related to cellular differentiation, containing over $430{,}000$ manually annotated cell locations. The dataset presents significant challenges: high cell density, overlapping and morphologically diverse cells, a long-tailed distribution of cell count per image, and variation in staining protocols. We benchmark three categories of existing methods: regression-based, crowd-counting, and cell-counting techniques on a test set with cell counts ranging from $10$ to $2{,}126$ cells per image. We also evaluate how the Segment Anything Model (SAM) can be adapted for microscopy cell counting using only dot-annotated datasets. As a case study, we implement a density-map-based adaptation of SAM (SAM-Counter) and report a mean absolute error (MAE) of $22.12$, which outperforms existing approaches (second-best MAE of $27.46$). Our results underscore the value of the dataset and the benchmarking framework for driving progress in automated cell counting and provide a robust foundation for future research and development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Paced GRPO, a reinforcement learning framework with adaptive rewards for improved video generation, addressing limitations of static reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO methods rely on fixed reward models, causing biases, quick saturation, and reduced performance as generators improve.

Method: The proposed Self-Paced GRPO employs a progressive reward mechanism that evolves with the generator, emphasizing different aspects of video quality, such as visual fidelity and semantic alignment, at appropriate stages of training.

Result: Experiments on VBench demonstrate enhanced visual quality and text-video semantic alignment compared to traditional GRPO approaches, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Self-Paced GRPO offers a more dynamic and stable optimization process by co-evolving reward feedback and generator quality, improving reinforcement learning outcomes for video generation.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning paradigm for post-training video generation models. However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on static, fixed-capacity reward models whose evaluation behavior is frozen during training. Such rigid rewards introduce distributional bias, saturate quickly as the generator improves, and ultimately limit the stability and effectiveness of reinforcement-based alignment. We propose Self-Paced GRPO, a competence-aware GRPO framework in which reward feedback co-evolves with the generator. Our method introduces a progressive reward mechanism that automatically shifts its emphasis from coarse visual fidelity to temporal coherence and fine-grained text-video semantic alignment as generation quality increases. This self-paced curriculum alleviates reward-policy mismatch, mitigates reward exploitation, and yields more stable optimization. Experiments on VBench across multiple video generation backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in both visual quality and semantic alignment over GRPO baselines with static rewards, validating the effectiveness and generality of Self-Paced GRPO.

*Zehong Ma,Longhui Wei,Shuai Wang,Shiliang Zhang,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a frequency-decoupled pixel diffusion framework to improve efficiency and performance in pixel diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pixel diffusion models have slow training and inference due to modeling both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics in one transformer model.

Method: The proposed method separates the generation of high-frequency details from low-frequency semantics using a pixel decoder and employs a frequency-aware flow-matching loss.

Result: The framework achieves superior results among pixel diffusion models, including FID scores of 1.62 and 2.22 on ImageNet and a GenEval overall score of 0.86 for text-to-image tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency-decoupled framework is more efficient and closes the performance gap with latent diffusion methods, advancing pixel diffusion capabilities.

Abstract: Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/DeCo.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel hybrid pipeline for lung cancer tumor staging, leveraging explicit measurements of tumor size and distances to anatomical structures rather than end-to-end image classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately staging lung cancer tumors is critical for optimizing prognosis and treatment but current deep learning often fails to incorporate essential spatial and anatomical information.

Method: The method uses encoder-decoder networks to segment lung anatomy and tumors, extract tumor dimensions and distances, and apply rule-based staging aligned to medical guidelines.

Result: Achieves an overall classification accuracy of 91.36% and high per-stage F1-scores (T1: 0.93, T2: 0.89, T3: 0.96, T4: 0.90) on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, outperforming traditional deep learning approaches.

Conclusion: This study provides an interpretable, clinically grounded approach to tumor stage classification with state-of-the-art accuracy, distinct from traditional 'black box' models.

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer tumor staging is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study that embeds explicit clinical context into tumor stage classification.

*Maroun Ayli,Youssef Bakouny,Tushar Sharma,Nader Jalloul,Hani Seifeddine,Rima Kilany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a graph-based representation for UI screenshots to improve design consistency and compliance checks. It demonstrates significant advances in discriminative power and scalability for multi-modal search frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for design consistency in enterprise software UIs struggle with structural modeling and rely primarily on visual similarity and text semantics.

Method: The authors propose converting UI screenshots into attributed graphs, which are processed by a contrastive graph autoencoder to learn embeddings incorporating visual, structural, and semantic properties.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art vision encoders in discriminative power and is integrated into UISearch, achieving high accuracy (0.92 Top-5) and low latency (47.5ms median).

Conclusion: The proposed graph-based representation enhances expressiveness and demonstrates scalability, enabling complex multi-modal queries and fine-grained distinction in enterprise UIs.

Abstract: Enterprise software companies maintain thousands of user interface screens across products and versions, creating critical challenges for design consistency, pattern discovery, and compliance check. Existing approaches rely on visual similarity or text semantics, lacking explicit modeling of structural properties fundamental to user interface (UI) composition. We present a novel graph-based representation that converts UI screenshots into attributed graphs encoding hierarchical relationships and spatial arrangements, potentially generalizable to document layouts, architectural diagrams, and other structured visual domains. A contrastive graph autoencoder learns embeddings preserving multi-level similarity across visual, structural, and semantic properties. The comprehensive analysis demonstrates that our structural embeddings achieve better discriminative power than state-of-the-art Vision Encoders, representing a fundamental advance in the expressiveness of the UI representation. We implement this representation in UISearch, a multi-modal search framework that combines structural embeddings with semantic search through a composable query language. On 20,396 financial software UIs, UISearch achieves 0.92 Top-5 accuracy with 47.5ms median latency (P95: 124ms), scaling to 20,000+ screens. The hybrid indexing architecture enables complex queries and supports fine-grained UI distinction impossible with vision-only approaches.

*Rachit Saluja,Asli Cihangir,Ruining Deng,Johannes C. Paetzold,Fengbei Liu,Mert R. Sabuncu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces BackSplit, a method to improve small lesion segmentation in medical images by representing background as diverse labels instead of a single class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small lesion segmentation in medical images remains challenging due to ignoring the heterogeneous anatomical context of background regions.

Method: BackSplit trains segmentation models using fine-grained background labels, enhancing model optimization and stability.

Result: The method improves small-lesion segmentation performance across datasets, utilizing either automatically generated or manually annotated auxiliary labels.

Conclusion: BackSplit offers a simple and effective paradigm for boosting segmentation performance without raising inference costs.

Abstract: Segmenting small lesions in medical images remains notoriously difficult. Most prior work tackles this challenge by either designing better architectures, loss functions, or data augmentation schemes; and collecting more labeled data. We take a different view, arguing that part of the problem lies in how the background is modeled. Common lesion segmentation collapses all non-lesion pixels into a single "background" class, ignoring the rich anatomical context in which lesions appear. In reality, the background is highly heterogeneous-composed of tissues, organs, and other structures that can now be labeled manually or inferred automatically using existing segmentation models.
  In this paper, we argue that training with fine-grained labels that sub-divide the background class, which we call BackSplit, is a simple yet powerful paradigm that can offer a significant performance boost without increasing inference costs. From an information theoretic standpoint, we prove that BackSplit increases the expected Fisher Information relative to conventional binary training, leading to tighter asymptotic bounds and more stable optimization. With extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures, we empirically show that BackSplit consistently boosts small-lesion segmentation performance, even when auxiliary labels are generated automatically using pretrained segmentation models. Additionally, we demonstrate that auxiliary labels derived from interactive segmentation frameworks exhibit the same beneficial effect, demonstrating its robustness, simplicity, and broad applicability.

*Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method, termed In-Video Instruction, for controlling image-to-video generation by embedding user guidance directly into the visual frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate if large-scale video generative models can interpret visual signals (like text, arrows) rather than textual prompts for controlling video generation.

Method: Embed visual instructions directly into frames to guide spatial-aware and targeted actions for multi-object scenarios.

Result: Experiments on advanced video generators demonstrate reliable execution of visually guided instructions, especially with complex scenes.

Conclusion: Visual embedded instructions can lead to precise and effective video generation, reinforcing the capability of video models.

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models have recently demonstrated strong visual capabilities, enabling the prediction of future frames that adhere to the logical and physical cues in the current observation. In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art generators, including Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2, show that video models can reliably interpret and execute such visually embedded instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces COVT, a framework enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with compact visual token reasoning for improved multimodal perception and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models struggle with tasks requiring dense visual understanding due to limitations in capturing spatial and geometric cues.

Method: COVT enables models to use compact continuous visual tokens, distilled from vision experts, for training and inference, focusing on dense visual reconstructions and multimodal reasoning.

Result: COVT boosts performance of strong VLMs by 3%-16% across diverse benchmarks, integrating visual token reasoning while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: Compact visual token reasoning through COVT enhances VLMs' precision, grounding, and interpretability across multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.

TL;DR: SAM3-Adapter improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency for complex tasks compared to previous SAM versions like SAM2 and SAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in fine-grained segmentation tasks with more effective performance compared to SAM and SAM2.

Method: Developed SAM3-Adapter with an architecture tailored for SAM3, reducing computational overhead and enhancing adaptability.

Result: SAM3-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art results in difficult segmentation tasks, such as medical imaging and camouflaged object detection.

Conclusion: SAM3-Adapter significantly enhances segmentation precision and generalizability, serving as a strong foundation for segmentation applications.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large-scale foundation models has reshaped the landscape of image segmentation, with models such as Segment Anything achieving unprecedented versatility across diverse vision tasks. However, previous generations-including SAM and its successor-still struggle with fine-grained, low-level segmentation challenges such as camouflaged object detection, medical image segmentation, cell image segmentation, and shadow detection. To address these limitations, we originally proposed SAM-Adapter in 2023, demonstrating substantial gains on these difficult scenarios. With the emergence of Segment Anything 3 (SAM3)-a more efficient and higher-performing evolution with a redesigned architecture and improved training pipeline-we revisit these long-standing challenges. In this work, we present SAM3-Adapter, the first adapter framework tailored for SAM3 that unlocks its full segmentation capability. SAM3-Adapter not only reduces computational overhead but also consistently surpasses both SAM and SAM2-based solutions, establishing new state-of-the-art results across multiple downstream tasks, including medical imaging, camouflaged (concealed) object segmentation, and shadow detection. Built upon the modular and composable design philosophy of the original SAM-Adapter, SAM3-Adapter provides stronger generalizability, richer task adaptability, and significantly improved segmentation precision. Extensive experiments confirm that integrating SAM3 with our adapter yields superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency compared to all prior SAM-based adaptations. We hope SAM3-Adapter can serve as a foundation for future research and practical segmentation applications. Code, pre-trained models, and data processing pipelines are available.

Motivation: The paper seeks to overcome SAM3D's inability to reconstruct 3D objects based on textual descriptions, enabling practical applications in areas like gaming and virtual environments.

Method: Introduced Ref-SAM3D, an extension to SAM3D, which incorporates textual descriptions as a high-level prior for text-guided 3D reconstruction using only a single RGB image.

Result: Ref-SAM3D achieves competitive and high-fidelity zero-shot reconstruction performance, aligning 2D visual cues with 3D geometric understanding.

Conclusion: Ref-SAM3D provides a flexible and accessible solution for reference-guided 3D reconstruction, bridging the gap between textual descriptions and 3D visualization.

Abstract: SAM3D has garnered widespread attention for its strong 3D object reconstruction capabilities. However, a key limitation remains: SAM3D cannot reconstruct specific objects referred to by textual descriptions, a capability that is essential for practical applications such as 3D editing, game development, and virtual environments. To address this gap, we introduce Ref-SAM3D, a simple yet effective extension to SAM3D that incorporates textual descriptions as a high-level prior, enabling text-guided 3D reconstruction from a single RGB image. Through extensive qualitative experiments, we show that Ref-SAM3D, guided only by natural language and a single 2D view, delivers competitive and high-fidelity zero-shot reconstruction performance. Our results demonstrate that Ref-SAM3D effectively bridges the gap between 2D visual cues and 3D geometric understanding, offering a more flexible and accessible paradigm for reference-guided 3D reconstruction.

Motivation: Existing task scheduling in embodied AI overlooks the importance of operations research and 3D spatial grounding. The researchers aim to address this limitation by providing a framework that tackles languaging understanding, 3D grounding, and task efficiency.

Method: The authors develop ORS3D-60K, a dataset of tasks based on real-world scenes. They introduce GRANT, an embodied multi-modal large language model with a scheduling token mechanism.

Result: Experiments on ORS3D-60K confirm GRANT's effectiveness in balancing language comprehension, 3D spatial grounding, and optimizing scheduling efficiency.

Conclusion: ORS3D and GRANT represent significant advancements in task scheduling for embodied agents by synergizing operations research principles with 3D spatial action grounding, improving overall task execution efficiency.

Abstract: Task scheduling is critical for embodied AI, enabling agents to follow natural language instructions and execute actions efficiently in 3D physical worlds. However, existing datasets often simplify task planning by ignoring operations research (OR) knowledge and 3D spatial grounding. In this work, we propose Operations Research knowledge-based 3D Grounded Task Scheduling (ORS3D), a new task that requires the synergy of language understanding, 3D grounding, and efficiency optimization. Unlike prior settings, ORS3D demands that agents minimize total completion time by leveraging parallelizable subtasks, e.g., cleaning the sink while the microwave operates. To facilitate research on ORS3D, we construct ORS3D-60K, a large-scale dataset comprising 60K composite tasks across 4K real-world scenes. Furthermore, we propose GRANT, an embodied multi-modal large language model equipped with a simple yet effective scheduling token mechanism to generate efficient task schedules and grounded actions. Extensive experiments on ORS3D-60K validate the effectiveness of GRANT across language understanding, 3D grounding, and scheduling efficiency.

TL;DR: Cloud4D is a novel framework that reconstructs 4D cloud states with ground cameras, improving resolution significantly compared to current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving next-generation weather prediction and climate models requires higher-resolution models and real-world observations, overcoming current instrumentation limitations.

Method: Cloud4D uses synchronized ground-based cameras with a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer to infer 3D liquid water content distribution and horizontal wind vectors.

Result: Cloud4D achieved an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution compared to satellite measurements, while maintaining relative error below 10% against radar data.

Conclusion: Cloud4D enhances cloud modeling with high-resolution reconstruction, offering promising advances for weather and climate predictions.

Abstract: There has been great progress in improving numerical weather prediction and climate models using machine learning. However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($<10\%$) against collocated radar measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is untapped potential in using video diffusion models for zero-shot image editing due to their strong simulation and reasoning abilities, motivating the exploration of repurposing these models for editing tasks.

Method: IF-Edit introduces a framework with (1) prompt enhancement for temporally grounded reasoning, (2) temporal latent dropout for efficiency and retaining coherence, and (3) post-refinement step for sharpening results.

Result: IF-Edit shows strong performance in reasoning-centric tasks and remains competitive in general-purpose image editing, validated through experiments on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of transforming pretrained video diffusion models into effective image editors and provides a systematic approach to unified video-image generative reasoning.

Abstract: Large-scale video diffusion models show strong world simulation and temporal reasoning abilities, but their use as zero-shot image editors remains underexplored. We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning.

TL;DR: VDC-Agent is an autonomous system for Video Detailed Captioning that operates without human annotations or large teacher models, leveraging prompt refinement and chain-of-thought processes for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an autonomous, scalable framework for Video Detailed Captioning without relying on human annotations or large pre-trained teacher models.

Method: The system uses a process of caption generation, principle-guided evaluation, and iterative prompt refinement, along with a self-reflection mechanism. It produces a dataset (VDC-Agent-19K) and trains the base MLLM using preference optimization.

Result: The model, VDC-Agent-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving accuracy and quality metrics over its base model.

Conclusion: VDC-Agent demonstrates the potential for self-evolving frameworks in video captioning, achieving high-quality results autonomously while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: We present VDC-Agent, a self-evolving framework for Video Detailed Captioning that requires neither human annotations nor larger teacher models. The agent forms a closed loop of caption generation, principle-guided scoring (score and textual suggestions), and prompt refinement. When caption quality regresses, a self-reflection path leverages the previous chain-of-thought to amend the update. Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs. We convert the trajectories into preference tuples and filter out samples with JSON parsing errors, resulting in VDC-Agent-19K, which contains 18,886 automatically constructed pairs. We then fine-tune the base MLLM on this dataset using an easy-to-hard curriculum direct preference optimization. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, our VDC-Agent-7B attains state-of-the-art performance on the VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving over the base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score at similar inference cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the shortcomings in existing methods for PBR texture generation, specifically in handling material decomposition under limited lighting and ensuring view-consistent texture completion.

Method: LumiTex employs a multi-branch generation scheme for material decomposition, a material attention mechanism for lighting-aware decoding, and a geometry-guided module for seamless UV texture completion.

Result: Extensive experiments prove that LumiTex delivers state-of-the-art texture quality, outperforming other open-source and commercial methods.

Conclusion: LumiTex advances PBR texture generation by addressing fundamental issues, paving the way for improved realism in computer graphics.

Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) provides a principled standard for realistic material-lighting interactions in computer graphics. Despite recent advances in generating PBR textures, existing methods fail to address two fundamental challenges: 1) materials decomposition from image prompts under limited illumination cues, and 2) seamless and view-consistent texture completion. To this end, we propose LumiTex, an end-to-end framework that comprises three key components: (1) a multi-branch generation scheme that disentangles albedo and metallic-roughness under shared illumination priors for robust material understanding, (2) a lighting-aware material attention mechanism that injects illumination context into the decoding process for physically grounded generation of albedo, metallic, and roughness maps, and (3) a geometry-guided inpainting module based on a large view synthesis model that enriches texture coverage and ensures seamless, view-consistent UV completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LumiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in texture quality, surpassing both existing open-source and commercial methods.

Conclusion: Pier effectively addresses global communication challenges in LLM pretraining, offering significant speedups without loss in model quality.

Abstract: Global communication, such as all-reduce and allgather, is the prominent performance bottleneck in large language model (LLM) pretraining. To address this issue, we present Pier, an efficient and scalable optimizer with relaxed global communication. Pier is built upon DiLoCo, which leverages an inner optimizer within groups of processors and an outer optimizer that requires global communication. To preserve the convergence and model performance, Pier incorporates two key techniques for the outer optimizer: momentum warmup and momentum decay. Pier employs an efficient and scalable system architecture to enable complex parallelization strategies in LLM pretraining. We examine the model performance and runtime reduction of Pier using the GPT model family (e.g., small, medium, XL, and 7B) and the OpenWebText dataset with a suite of thirteen downstream tasks. With data parallel strategy, Pier speeds up GPT-2 XL training by up to 2.7x-3.7x on 256 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and 1.2x-1.9x on 64 GH200 Superchips, respectively, without degradation of validation loss or downstream task performance. With data parallel and tensor parallel, Pier reduces the time cost GPT-2 7B model training by 54.5% on 128 A100s.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the state-space explosion problem in response-time analysis, particularly in non-preemptive systems, by introducing a new approach for real-time guarantees.

Method: The authors introduce a Python toolkit named SAGkit based on the schedule-abstraction graph (SAG) framework to analyze hybrid-triggered jobs.

Result: SAGkit achieves exact response-time analysis with acceptable runtime and memory overhead according to the experiments.

Conclusion: SAGkit offers researchers a robust tool for analyzing distributed control systems and is open-access for further development.

Abstract: For distributed control systems, modern latency-critical applications are increasingly demanding real-time guarantees and robustness. Response-time analysis (RTA) is useful for this purpose, as it helps analyze and guarantee timing bounds. However, conventional RTA methods struggle with the state-space explosion problem, especially in non-preemptive systems with release jitter and execution time variations. In this paper, we introduce SAGkit, a Python toolkit that implements the schedule-abstraction graph (SAG) framework. SAGkit novelly enables exact and sustainable RTA of hybrid-triggered jobs by allowing job absence on the SAG basis. Our experiments demonstrate that SAGkit achieves exactness with acceptable runtime and memory overhead. This lightweight toolkit empowers researchers to analyze complex distributed control systems and is open-access for further development.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIDAS, a middleware layer to address metadata hotspots in I/O-intensive systems, improving queue lengths and hotspot mitigation without kernel or backend changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metadata hotspots disrupt scalable I/O in HPC and cloud storage environments, causing long queues, high latencies, and reduced throughput, which current solutions inadequately address.

Method: MIDAS employs a namespace-aware load balancer, a cooperative caching layer with backend-preserving semantics, and a self-stabilizing control loop to adapt dynamically to workloads.

Result: MIDAS reduces average queue lengths by 23% and mitigates worst-case hotspots by up to 80% compared to traditional round-robin scheduling.

Conclusion: MIDAS demonstrates that a stability-aware, backend-agnostic middleware approach improves scalability and reliability in metadata management for I/O-intensive environments.

Abstract: Metadata hotspots remain one of the key obstacles to scalable Input/Output (I/O) in both High-Performance Computing (HPC) and cloud-scale storage environments. Situations such as job start-ups, checkpoint storms, or heavily skewed namespace access can trigger thousands of concurrent metadata requests against a small subset of servers. The result is long queues, inflated tail latencies, and reduced system throughput. Prior efforts including static namespace partitioning, backend-specific extensions, and kernel-level modifications address parts of the problem, but they often prove too rigid, intrusive to deploy, or unstable under shifting workloads. We present MIDAS, an adaptive middleware layer that operates transparently between clients and metadata servers, requiring no changes to kernels or storage backends. The design brings together three mechanisms: (i) a namespace-aware load balancer that enhances consistent hashing with power-of-d sampling informed by live telemetry, (ii) a cooperative caching layer that preserves backend semantics through leases, invalidations, or adaptive timeouts, and (iii) a self-stabilizing control loop that dynamically adjusts routing aggressiveness and cache lifetimes while avoiding oscillations under bursty workloads. Analysis of the model and controlled experiments show that MIDAS reduces average queue lengths by roughly 23% and mitigates worst-case hotspots by up to 80% when compared to round-robin scheduling. These findings highlight that a stability-aware, middleware-based strategy can provide backend-agnostic improvements to metadata management, enabling better scalability in bursty scenarios, more predictable tail latencies, and stronger overall system performance.

TL;DR: This paper enhances CloudSim Plus for realistic spot instance management, evaluates the HLEM-VMP algorithm in dynamic markets, and demonstrates improved reliability and cost-effectiveness in cloud resource allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic pricing models in cloud environments, such as spot instances, offer cost benefits but face challenges like volatility and workload scheduling inefficiencies. This study aims to address these issues.

Method: The authors extended the CloudSim Plus framework for realistic spot instance lifecycle simulation and adapted the HLEM-VMP algorithm to operate in dynamic conditions, evaluating it against baseline strategies using synthetic scenarios and the Google Cluster Trace dataset.

Result: The HLEM-VMP algorithm showed a reduction in spot instance interruptions and lower maximum interruption durations compared to baseline strategies, validating the framework and approach.

Conclusion: This work provides a robust simulation framework and insights into improving virtual machine allocation and managing market risks, paving the way for more reliable and cost-efficient cloud computing resource management.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on dynamic pricing models, such as spot instances, in public cloud environments presents new challenges for workload scheduling and reliability. While these models offer cost advantages, they introduce volatility and uncertainty that are not fully addressed by current allocation algorithms or simulation tools. This work contributes to the modeling and evaluation of such environments by extending the CloudSim Plus simulation framework to support realistic spot instance lifecycle management, including interruption, termination, hibernation, and reallocation. The enhanced simulator is validated using synthetic scenarios and large-scale simulations based on the Google Cluster Trace dataset. Building on this foundation, the HLEM-VMP allocation algorithm, originally proposed in earlier research, was adapted to operate under dynamic spot market conditions. Its performance was evaluated against baseline allocation strategies to assess its efficiency and resilience in volatile workload environments. The comparison demonstrated a reduction in the number of spot instance interruptions as well as a decrease in the maximum interruption duration. Overall, this work provides both a simulation framework for simulating dynamic cloud behavior and analytical insights into virtual machine allocation performance and market risk, contributing to more robust and cost-effective resource management in cloud computing.

*Rajat Bhattacharjya,Sing-Yao Wu,Hyunwoo Oh,Chaewon Nam,Suyeon Koo,Mohsen Imani,Elaheh Bozorgzadeh,Nikil Dutt*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents AVERY, a framework enabling deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in UAV disaster response through adaptive split computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge where UAVs operating in disaster scenarios need complex semantic reasoning capabilities that existing on-board CNNs cannot offer, while high resource demands of VLMs and low-bandwidth environments complicate deployment.

Method: The authors propose a novel dual-stream split computing model which separates VLM processes into a high-frequency, low-resolution "context stream" and a low-frequency, high-fidelity "insight stream." A self-aware controller adjusts compression models dynamically based on environment and tasks.

Result: AVERY achieves higher accuracy (+11.2%) and significantly lower energy consumption (-93.98%) compared to baseline methods, demonstrating better adaptability and efficiency under variable network conditions in a simulated edge-cloud scenario.

Conclusion: AVERY enables real-time, energy-efficient queryable intelligence for UAVs in disaster zones, overcoming the limitations of existing deployment and resource constraints.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in disaster response require complex, queryable intelligence that on-board CNNs cannot provide. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution "context stream" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity "insight stream" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.

### [466] [Monotone Decontamination of Arbitrary Dynamic Graphs with Mobile Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18315)
*Rajashree Bar,Daibik Barik,Adri Bhattacharya,Partha Sarathi Mandal*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the monotone decontamination problem in dynamic graphs by proposing two models of dynamicities, analyzing optimal agent requirements, and exploring bounds and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to extend the monotone decontamination problem, which has been studied in static graphs, to the largely unexplored domain of dynamic graphs and optimize the agent requirements for this purpose.

Method: The paper introduces two models of dynamicity and derives lower and upper bounds on the agents required for monotone decontamination in arbitrary dynamic graphs.

Result: The study provides insights into agent optimization and highlights challenges like the effects of edge disappearance and reappearance during monotone decontamination in dynamic graphs.

Conclusion: The paper extends monotone decontamination research to dynamic graphs, offering frameworks and contributing to the optimization of agent numbers required for solving the problem.

Abstract: Network decontamination is a well-known problem, in which the aim of the mobile agents should be to decontaminate the network (i.e., both nodes and edges). This problem comes with an added constraint, i.e., of \emph{monotonicity}, in which whenever a node or an edge is decontaminated, it must not get recontaminated. Hence, the name comes \emph{monotone decontamination}. This problem has been relatively explored in static graphs, but nothing is known yet in dynamic graphs. We, in this paper, study the \emph{monotone decontamination} problem in arbitrary dynamic graphs. We designed two models of dynamicity, based on the time within which a disappeared edge must reappear. In each of these two models, we proposed lower bounds as well as upper bounds on the number of agents, required to fully decontaminate the underlying dynamic graph, monotonically. Our results also highlight the difficulties faced due to the sudden disappearance or reappearance of edges. Our aim in this paper has been to primarily optimize the number of agents required to solve monotone decontamination in these dynamic networks.

### [467] [An Online Fragmentation-Aware GPU Scheduler for Multi-Tenant MIG-based Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18906)
*Marco Zambianco,Lorenzo Fasol,Roberto Doriguzzi-Corin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scheduling framework to optimize GPU resource utilization in Multi-Instance GPU (MIG)-based cloud environments, addressing fragmentation inefficiencies and improving workload acceptance rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) fixed partitioning, which causes GPU fragmentation and inefficiencies in workload scheduling in multi-tenant cloud environments.

Method: The authors develop a novel scheduling framework that uses a fragmentation metric to minimize resource inefficiencies. A greedy algorithm is introduced to allocate GPU and MIG slices effectively for incoming workloads.

Result: The proposed method shows a consistent 10% increase in workload acceptance rates under heavy load conditions, with similar GPU usage compared to existing baseline strategies.

Conclusion: The approach successfully mitigates GPU fragmentation and improves resource allocation in MIG-based cloud systems, enhancing workload scheduling efficiency and resource utilization.

Abstract: The explosive growth of AI applications has created unprecedented demand for GPU resources. Cloud providers meet this demand through GPU-as-a-Service platforms that offer rentable GPU resources for running AI workloads. In this context, the sharing of GPU resources between different tenants is essential to maximize the number of scheduled workloads. Among the various GPU sharing technologies, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) stands out by partitioning GPUs at hardware level into isolated slices with dedicated compute and memory, ensuring strong tenant isolation, preventing resource contention, and enhancing security. Despite these advantages, MIG's fixed partitioning introduces scheduling rigidity, leading to severe GPU fragmentation in multi-tenant environments, where workloads are continuously deployed and terminated. Fragmentation leaves GPUs underutilized, limiting the number of workloads that can be accommodated. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel scheduling framework for MIG-based clouds that maximizes workload acceptance while mitigating fragmentation in an online, workload-agnostic setting. We introduce a fragmentation metric to quantify resource inefficiency and guide allocation decisions. Building on this metric, our greedy scheduling algorithm selects GPUs and MIG slices that minimize fragmentation growth for each incoming workload. We evaluate our approach against multiple baseline strategies under diverse workload distributions. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher workload acceptance rates, leading to an average 10% increase in the number of scheduled workloads in heavy load conditions, while using approximately the same number of GPUs as the benchmark methods.

### [468] [AME: An Efficient Heterogeneous Agentic Memory Engine for Smartphones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19192)
*Xinkui Zhao,Qingyu Ma,Yifan Zhang,Hengxuan Lou,Guanjie Cheng,Shuiguang Deng,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces AME, an on-device Agentic Memory Engine optimized for smartphone SoCs, addressing challenges specific to mobile environments and workloads for vector databases, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device agents on smartphones need evolving memory for long-term, context-aware behaviors while preserving privacy and performance. Existing vector databases are designed for servers, causing inefficiencies when directly adapted for smartphones.

Method: The authors propose AME, which incorporates a hardware-aware, high-efficiency matrix pipeline and a coordinated scheduling scheme tailored to modern smartphone SoCs to optimize compute utilization and manage operations efficiently.

Result: Implemented on Snapdragon 8-series SoCs, AME demonstrated up to 1.4x improvement in query throughput, 7x faster index construction, and 6x higher insertion throughput under concurrent workloads.

Conclusion: AME successfully bridges the gap between server-class vector databases and smartphone constraints, providing an efficient, privacy-conscious solution tailored for on-device memory challenges.

Abstract: On-device agents on smartphones increasingly require continuously evolving memory to support personalized, context-aware, and long-term behaviors. To meet both privacy and responsiveness demands, user data is embedded as vectors and stored in a vector database for fast similarity search. However, most existing vector databases target server-class environments. When ported directly to smartphones, two gaps emerge: (G1) a mismatch between mobile SoC constraints and vector-database assumptions, including tight bandwidth budgets, limited on-chip memory, and stricter data type and layout constraints; and (G2) a workload mismatch, because on-device usage resembles a continuously learning memory, in which queries must coexist with frequent inserts, deletions, and ongoing index maintenance. To address these challenges, we propose AME, an on-device Agentic Memory Engine co-designed with modern smartphone SoCs. AME introduces two key techniques: (1) a hardware-aware, high-efficiency matrix pipeline that maximizes compute-unit utilization and exploits multi-level on-chip storage to sustain high throughput; and (2) a hardware- and workload-aware scheduling scheme that coordinates querying, insertion, and index rebuilding to minimize latency. We implement AME on Snapdragon 8-series SoCs and evaluate it on HotpotQA. In our experiments, AME improves query throughput by up to 1.4x at matched recall, achieves up to 7x faster index construction, and delivers up to 6x higher insertion throughput under concurrent query workloads.

### [469] [IOMMU Support for Virtual-Address Remote DMA in an ARMv8 environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19258)
*Antonis Psistakis*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper tests and demonstrates the use of ARM's IOMMU (SMMU) to ensure address translation and coherence in complex systems with multiple CPUs. Custom kernel modules were developed for experimentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining efficient and correct coherence between nodes in complex systems, leveraging the IOMMU (SMMU) to support a virtualized global address space system.

Method: The authors implemented custom kernel modules to validate and test the SMMU for address translation using Linux, focusing on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC platform.

Result: The SMMU's correct operation was demonstrated in scenarios of DMA transfers triggered from both the Processing System (PS) and Programmable Logic (PL), with successful testing of dynamic virtual-to-physical address translations.

Conclusion: The paper validates the critical role of the SMMU in dynamic memory translation, laying groundwork for future exploration of its advanced features.

Abstract: In complex systems with many compute nodes containing multiple CPUs that are coherent within each node, a key challenge is maintaining efficient and correct coherence between nodes. The Unimem system addresses this by proposing a virtualized global address space that enables such coherence, relying on the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) in each node. The goal of this thesis is to support this approach by successfully testing and using the IOMMU of a single node. For this purpose, we used ARM's IOMMU, known as the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Because Linux documentation for the SMMU is limited and unclear, we implemented custom kernel modules to test and use its functionality.
  First, we tested the SMMU in the Processing System (PS) of the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC by developing a module that inserted virtual-to-physical address mappings into the SMMU. We then triggered a DMA transfer to a virtual address and observed that the request passed through the SMMU for address translation. We repeated this experiment by initiating DMA transactions from the Programmable Logic (PL) and similarly confirmed that the transactions were translated by the SMMU. Finally, we developed a module that enables transactions from the PL without requiring explicit pre-mapping of virtual and physical address pairs. This was achieved by configuring the SMMU with the page table pointer of a user process, allowing it to translate all relevant virtual addresses dynamically.
  Overall, we successfully demonstrated the correct operation of the SMMU across all tested scenarios. Due to time constraints, further exploration of advanced SMMU features is left for future work.

### [470] [Constant-Size Certificates for Leader Election in Chordal Graphs and Related Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19208)
*Jérémie Chalopin,Maria Kokkou*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper develops local certification schemes for leader election and spanning tree construction in specific graph classes, and proposes a method to transform any certification scheme into a silent self-stabilizing algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently verifying distributed problem solutions using local conditions tailored to specific graph structures such as chordal and dismantlable graphs.

Method: Design constant-size local certification schemes constrained to one-hop neighborhood graphs and introduce an automated transformation algorithm to create silent self-stabilizing algorithms.

Result: First local certification results for leader election and spanning tree construction in specialized graph classes, and a novel transformation to silent self-stabilizing algorithms with minimal state additions.

Conclusion: The paper contributes new certification approaches for specific graph classes and opens potential for structural insights and broader applications to ensure correctness and fault recovery in distributed systems.

Abstract: In distributed computing a certification scheme consists of a set of states and conditions over those states that enable each node of a graph to efficiently verify the correctness of a solution to a given problem. This work focuses on two fundamental problems: leader election and spanning tree construction. For each problem, we present a constant-size (per edge), local certification scheme, where the conditions available to each node can only refer to the graph induced by its one-hop neighborhood. In particular, we provide certification schemes for leader election in chordal and $K_4$-free dismantlable graphs and for spanning tree construction in dismantlable graphs, assuming a root is given. For chordal graphs, our leader election certification scheme additionally ensures an acyclic orientation, a property that is not generally verifiable using constant-size certificates in arbitrary graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first local certification results tailored to these graph classes, potentially highlighting structural properties useful for verifying additional problems. Finally, we propose an algorithm that automatically transforms any certification scheme into a silent self-stabilizing algorithm (i.e., an algorithm that automatically recovers from faults) by adding only one extra state to the set of states of the certification scheme, assuming a Gouda fair scheduler. This transformation may be of independent interest.

### [471] [Practical Machine Learning for Aphasic Discourse Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17553)
*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the use of supervised machine learning models to automate the analysis of Correct Information Units (CIUs) in spoken discourse for persons with aphasia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual CIU analysis is labor-intensive for speech-language pathologists, motivating the development of machine learning methods to automate this process.

Method: The study trained and evaluated five supervised machine learning models using human-coded transcripts of aphasic speech during a picture description task, to distinguish words and CIUs in discourse.

Result: The models achieved near-perfect accuracy (0.995) in distinguishing words vs. non-words, while CIU vs. non-CIU identification showed greater variability, with k-nearest neighbor achieving the highest accuracy (0.824).

Conclusion: Supervised ML models reliably identify words but face challenges in accurately identifying CIUs, suggesting further refinement is needed for clinical application.

Abstract: Analyzing spoken discourse is a valid means of quantifying language ability in persons with aphasia. There are many ways to quantify discourse, one common way being to evaluate the informativeness of the discourse. That is, given the total number of words produced, how many of those are context-relevant and accurate. This type of analysis is called Correct Information Unit (CIU) analysis and is one of the most prevalent discourse analyses used by speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Despite this, CIU analysis in the clinic remains limited due to the manual labor needed by SLPs to code and analyze collected speech. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) seek to augment such labor by automating modeling of propositional, macrostructural, pragmatic, and multimodal dimensions of discourse. To that end, this study evaluated five ML models for reliable identification of Correct Information Units (CIUs, Nicholas & Brookshire, 1993), during a picture description task. The five supervised ML models were trained using randomly selected human-coded transcripts and accompanying words and CIUs from persons with aphasia. The baseline model training produced a high accuracy across transcripts for word vs non-word, with all models achieving near perfect performance (0.995) with high AUC range (0.914 min, 0.995 max). In contrast, CIU vs non-CIU showed a greater variability, with the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) model the highest accuracy (0.824) and second highest AUC (0.787). These findings indicate that while the supervised ML models can distinguish word from not word, identifying CIUs is challenging.

*Saicharan Kolluru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates two LLM serving frameworks, vLLM and HuggingFace TGI, using LLaMA-2 models and recommends systems based on specific workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient inference serving systems to optimize throughput, latency, and resource utilization in deploying LLMs.

Method: Empirical benchmarking of vLLM and TGI frameworks across throughput, latency, GPU memory usage, scalability, and using LLaMA-2 models.

Result: vLLM shows up to 24x higher throughput due to its PagedAttention mechanism, while TGI excels in low-latency interactive scenarios.

Conclusion: Choice of system depends on use-case: vLLM is ideal for high-throughput batch tasks, TGI for latency-sensitive applications with moderate concurrency.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in production environments requires efficient inference serving systems that balance throughput, latency, and resource utilization. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of two prominent open-source LLM serving frameworks: vLLM and HuggingFace Text Generation Inference (TGI). We benchmark these systems across multiple dimensions including throughput performance, end-to-end latency, GPU memory utilization, and scalability characteristics using LLaMA-2 models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters. Our experiments reveal that vLLM achieves up to 24x higher throughput than TGI under high-concurrency workloads through its novel PagedAttention mechanism, while TGI demonstrates lower tail latencies for interactive single-user scenarios. We provide detailed performance profiles for different deployment scenarios and offer practical recommendations for system selection based on workload characteristics. Our findings indicate that the choice between these frameworks should be guided by specific use-case requirements: vLLM excels in high-throughput batch processing scenarios, while TGI is better suited for latency-sensitive interactive applications with moderate concurrency.

*Guilherme Grancho D. Fernandes,Marco A. Barroca,Mateus dos Santos,Rafael S. Oliveira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a bidirectional LSTM for classifying transient astronomical objects from the PLAsTiCC dataset into reorganized categories but reveals issues caused by class imbalance and limited temporal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations in class imbalance and efficient classification of transient astronomical objects using light curves.

Method: Reorganizing the original dataset classes, preprocessing with padding, temporal rescaling, flux normalization, and training a bidirectional LSTM with masking layers.

Result: The model performed strongly for S-Like and Periodic categories but struggled with Fast and Long classes and exhibited confusion between Periodic/Non-Periodic objects, especially with partial light curve data.

Conclusion: Model limitations indicate that addressing class imbalance and improving preprocessing methods focusing on temporal detection moments could enhance classification performance.

Abstract: This study presents a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for classifying transient astronomical object light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) dataset. The original fourteen object classes were reorganized into five generalized categories (S-Like, Fast, Long, Periodic, and Non-Periodic) to address class imbalance. After preprocessing with padding, temporal rescaling, and flux normalization, a bidirectional LSTM network with masking layers was trained and evaluated on a test set of 19,920 objects. The model achieved strong performance for S-Like and Periodic classes, with ROC area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.95 and 0.99, and Precision-Recall AUC values of 0.98 and 0.89, respectively. However, performance was significantly lower for Fast and Long classes (ROC AUC of 0.68 for Long class), and the model exhibited difficulty distinguishing between Periodic and Non-Periodic objects. Evaluation on partial light curve data (5, 10,and 20 days from detection) revealed substantial performance degradation, with increased misclassification toward the S-Like class. These findings indicate that class imbalance and limited temporal information are primary limitations, suggesting that class balancing strategies and preprocessing techniques focusing on detection moments could improve performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoSAGE, a CUDA scheduler for Sparse GNN operations that adapts to input properties for performance optimization, demonstrating significant kernel-level speedups in tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance variability in Sparse GNN tasks caused by factors like degree skew, feature width, and GPU architecture.

Method: Developed AutoSAGE, a scheduler that uses input-aware tiling and mapping, incorporates micro-probes for refinement, and integrates with a CSR attention pipeline.

Result: AutoSAGE matches vendor baselines for certain feature widths and delivers up to 4.7x speedups in stress tests on synthetic sparsity and skew.

Conclusion: AutoSAGE effectively optimizes sparse GNN operations on varied inputs, with reproducible CUDA tools and logs provided for users.

Abstract: Sparse GNN aggregations (CSR SpMM/SDDMM) vary widely in performance with degree skew, feature width, and GPU micro-architecture. We present AutoSAGE, an input-aware CUDA scheduler that chooses tiling and mapping per input using a lightweight estimate refined by on-device micro-probes, with a guardrail that safely falls back to vendor kernels and a persistent cache for deterministic replay. AutoSAGE covers SpMM and SDDMM and composes into a CSR attention pipeline (SDDMM -> row-softmax -> SpMM). On Reddit and OGBN-Products, it matches vendor baselines at bandwidth-bound feature widths and finds gains at small widths; on synthetic sparsity and skew stress tests it achieves up to 4.7x kernel-level speedups. We release CUDA sources, Python bindings, a reproducible harness, and replayable cache logs.

*Shuaiyu Xie,Hanbin He,Jian Wang,Bing Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CCLH, a framework for root cause analysis in microservice systems, addressing challenges in existing methods with enhanced inter-task collaboration and modeling group-level influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in root cause analysis for microservice systems, including lack of causal task collaboration and oversight of group influences between logical instances.

Method: Introduce CCLH, a framework using cascaded conditional learning with a three-level taxonomy for group influences and a heterogeneous hypergraph to model failure propagation.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal CCLH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in root cause localization (RCL) and failure type identification (FTI).

Conclusion: CCLH improves diagnosis tasks' collaboration and accuracy by addressing causal dependencies and group influence modeling.

Abstract: Root cause analysis in microservice systems typically involves two core tasks: root cause localization (RCL) and failure type identification (FTI). Despite substantial research efforts, conventional diagnostic approaches still face two key challenges. First, these methods predominantly adopt a joint learning paradigm for RCL and FTI to exploit shared information and reduce training time. However, this simplistic integration neglects the causal dependencies between tasks, thereby impeding inter-task collaboration and information transfer. Second, these existing methods primarily focus on point-to-point relationships between instances, overlooking the group nature of inter-instance influences induced by deployment configurations and load balancing. To overcome these limitations, we propose CCLH, a novel root cause analysis framework that orchestrates diagnostic tasks based on cascaded conditional learning. CCLH provides a three-level taxonomy for group influences between instances and incorporates a heterogeneous hypergraph to model these relationships, facilitating the simulation of failure propagation. Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from three microservice benchmarks demonstrate that CCLH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both RCL and FTI.

*Mengchun Zhang,Kateryna Shapovalenko,Yucheng Shao,Eddie Guo,Parusha Pradhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiDiffNet, a framework for improving generalization in EEG neural decoding tasks without relying on generative augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results and providing standardized benchmarks and protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of poor generalization in EEG neural decoding due to high inter-subject variability and insufficient data by proposing a scalable and subject-independent approach.

Method: MultiDiffNet leverages a diffusion-based framework to create a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives, skipping generative augmentation and directly decoding from this latent space.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse EEG decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. A unified benchmark suite was curated for four decoding tasks along with an improved statistical evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: MultiDiffNet establishes a reproducible, standardized foundation for subject-agnostic EEG decoding, advancing real-world applications of BCI systems and setting benchmarks for consistent evaluations.

Abstract: Neural decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) remains fundamentally limited by poor generalization to unseen subjects, driven by high inter-subject variability and the lack of large-scale datasets to model it effectively. Existing methods often rely on synthetic subject generation or simplistic data augmentation, but these strategies fail to scale or generalize reliably. We introduce \textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research. Finally, we develop a statistical reporting framework tailored for low-trial EEG settings. Our work provides a reproducible and open-source foundation for subject-agnostic EEG decoding in real-world BCI systems.

*Le Xu,Jiayu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper enhances offline reinforcement learning's robustness against data corruption by introducing Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) as a novel optimizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline reinforcement learning struggles with data corruption, as current robust algorithms fail in challenging scenarios due to sharp minima in the loss landscape.

Method: The paper integrates SAM, a technique for finding flatter minima, into baseline RL algorithms like IQL and RIQL to address data corruption and improve generalization.

Result: SAM-enhanced methods consistently outperform original baselines on D4RL benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in both random and adversarial data corruption scenarios.

Conclusion: SAM effectively improves the robustness of offline RL agents by achieving smoother solutions and enabling better generalization under challenging corrupted datasets.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is vulnerable to real-world data corruption, with even robust algorithms failing under challenging observation and mixture corruptions. We posit this failure stems from data corruption creating sharp minima in the loss landscape, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we are the first to apply Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) as a general-purpose, plug-and-play optimizer for offline RL. SAM seeks flatter minima, guiding models to more robust parameter regions. We integrate SAM into strong baselines for data corruption: IQL, a top-performing offline RL algorithm in this setting, and RIQL, an algorithm designed specifically for data-corruption robustness. We evaluate them on D4RL benchmarks with both random and adversarial corruption. Our SAM-enhanced methods consistently and significantly outperform the original baselines. Visualizations of the reward surface confirm that SAM finds smoother solutions, providing strong evidence for its effectiveness in improving the robustness of offline RL agents.

*Kichang Yang,Seonjun Kim,Minjae Kim,Nairan Zhang,Chi Zhang,Youngki Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neuron Chunking introduces a sparsification strategy to optimize I/O efficiency during large Vision-Language Model (VLM) deployment on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models increasingly rely on flash-based weight offloading during edge deployment. However, traditional sparsification methods fail to account for the storage access patterns influencing flash performance.

Method: Neuron Chunking groups neurons into contiguous chunks and sparsifies them based on an I/O latency model. It selects chunks with high utility, combining neuron importance and storage access cost in its decision-making.

Result: Neuron Chunking achieves up to 4.65x and 5.76x improvement in I/O efficiency on Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson AGX Orin, respectively.

Conclusion: By integrating storage access patterns into sparsification decisions, Neuron Chunking significantly enhances the I/O efficiency of deploying large VLMs on edge devices.

Abstract: Edge deployment of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) increasingly relies on flash-based weight offloading, where activation sparsification is used to reduce I/O overhead. However, conventional sparsification remains model-centric, selecting neurons solely by activation magnitude and neglecting how access patterns influence flash performance. We present Neuron Chunking, an I/O-efficient sparsification strategy that operates on chunks (i.e., groups of contiguous neurons in memory) and couples neuron importance with storage access cost. The method models I/O latency through a lightweight abstraction of access contiguity and selects chunks with high utility, defined as neuron importance normalized by estimated latency. By aligning sparsification decisions with the underlying storage behavior, Neuron Chunking improves I/O efficiency by up to 4.65x and 5.76x on Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson AGX Orin, respectively.

### [479] [Binary BPE: A Family of Cross-Platform Tokenizers for Binary Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17573)
*Michael J. Bommarito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Binary BPE tokenizers to resolve issues with conventional byte-level tokenization in binary analysis, offering interpretable and efficient solutions for processing executable files.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the inefficiency of byte-level tokenization and the limitations of text-oriented tokenizers when applied to arbitrary binary sequences, enabling better utilization of context window capacity and creating scalable solutions for binary analysis.

Method: The authors designed and trained Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers specifically tailored for binaries, using a diverse corpus of executables from various platforms. The tokenizers were developed with different vocabulary sizes to enable adaptability and scaling.

Result: Binary BPE tokenizers significantly enhance binary content representation, allowing 2-3x more data to fit in transformer context windows compared to raw bytes. The tokenizers also identify interpretable patterns and offer multi-byte compression capabilities.

Conclusion: Binary BPE tokenizers are efficient tools for binary analysis, improving the performance of content identification, malware detection, reverse engineering, and optimization. They are openly shared for practical use in binary-focused models and tools.

Abstract: Sequence models for binary analysis are bottlenecked by byte-level tokenization: raw bytes waste precious context window capacity for transformers and other neural network architectures, and many existing text-oriented tokenizers fail on arbitrary 0x00--0xFF sequences. To address this issue, we introduce the Binary BPE tokenizer family, a set of cross-platform Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers for executables trained on a large corpus of binaries spanning multiple platforms, architectures, and operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and malware sources. We release trained tokenizers with vocabularies of 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, and 64K tokens, enabling both systematic scaling studies and practical deployment from resource-constrained edge devices to high-throughput datacenters. These tokenizers discover interpretable patterns (ELF/PE headers, instruction sequences, cross-platform strings) while yielding multi-byte compression per token. On representative uncompressed executables (e.g., ELF/PE/Mach-O rather than compressed APKs), the Binary BPE tokenizers typically allow for roughly 2-3x more binary content per fixed-length transformer context window than raw bytes, enabling more efficient research and practical deployment for content identification, malware detection, reverse engineering, and optimization. We release the trained Binary BPE tokenizers on HuggingFace, providing a drop-in, open-source foundation for binary-focused language models and context-efficient agentic tools.

### [480] [Efficient Mathematical Reasoning Models via Dynamic Pruning and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17577)
*Fengming Yu,Qingyu Meng,Haiwei Pan,Kejia Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses computational limitations of large language models in mathematical reasoning by proposing a lightweight optimization method integrating dynamic attention head pruning and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational and storage costs of large language models restrict their practical deployment despite their proficiency in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: The method combines dynamic attention head pruning, based on weight norms and entropy, with knowledge distillation to transfer reasoning capability from the original model to the pruned model.

Result: On Math23k with 30% pruning, parameters reduced by 18.7%, inference speed improved by 27.5%, FLOPs reduced by 19.3%, and accuracy minimally drops by 0.7%.

Conclusion: The approach ensures significant efficiency improvements while maintaining reasoning performance, facilitating deployment of large language models in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, large language models have shown strong capabilities in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical equation solving. However, their substantial computational and storage costs hinder practical deployment. This paper proposes a lightweight optimization method that integrates dynamic attention head pruning with knowledge distillation. The approach dynamically evaluates the importance of each attention head in the multi-head attention mechanism using a combination of weight norms and entropy, and prunes redundant heads in real time to reduce computational overhead. To mitigate performance degradation, knowledge distillation transfers information from the original model to the pruned student, enabling the smaller model to preserve reasoning ability. Experiments conducted on both Math23k and ASDiv-A verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, on Math23k with a 30% pruning ratio, parameters are reduced by 18.7%, inference speed is improved by 27.5%, FLOPs are reduced by 19.3%, and accuracy drops only 0.7% (from 84.4% to 83.7%). These results demonstrate that the method achieves substantial efficiency gains while maintaining strong reasoning performance, providing a practical solution for efficient deployment of large language models in mathematical reasoning tasks.

### [481] [Multi-Value Alignment for LLMs via Value Decorrelation and Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17579)
*Hefei Xu,Le Wu,Chen Cheng,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multi-Value Alignment (MVA) framework to address shortcomings in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multiple human values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the challenge of aligning LLMs with diverse and sometimes conflicting human values while addressing the inefficiencies and conflicts in current alignment methods.

Method: The authors propose the MVA framework that reduces alignment degradation by minimizing mutual information between parameters representing diverse values and employs value extrapolation to explore Pareto frontier efficiently.

Result: Experiments show MVA consistently performs better compared to existing methods in optimizing multi-value alignment for LLMs.

Conclusion: MVA is an effective solution for improving multi-value alignment in LLMs, addressing both inefficiencies and conflicts in current methods, achieving better trade-offs among value preferences.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), aligning them with human values for safety and ethics has become a critical challenge. This problem is especially challenging when multiple, potentially conflicting human values must be considered and balanced. Although several variants of existing alignment methods (such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)) have been proposed to address multi-value alignment, they suffer from notable limitations: 1) they are often unstable and inefficient in multi-value optimization; and 2) they fail to effectively handle value conflicts. As a result, these approaches typically struggle to achieve optimal trade-offs when aligning multiple values.
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Multi-Value Alignment (MVA). It mitigates alignment degradation caused by parameter interference among diverse human values by minimizing their mutual information. Furthermore, we propose a value extrapolation strategy to efficiently explore the Pareto frontier, thereby constructing a set of LLMs with diverse value preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVA consistently outperforms existing baselines in aligning LLMs with multiple human values.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework, EgoCogNav, to model human navigation by incorporating cognitive factors. It predicts perceived path uncertainty and integrates sensory cues for trajectory and head motion forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand human-environment interaction and improve safe social navigation and assistive wayfinding by including cognitive aspects of navigation.

Method: A multimodal egocentric navigation framework, EgoCogNav, predicts uncertainty, jointly forecasts trajectories and head motions using scene features and sensory cues. It also introduces the CEN dataset for diverse navigation behaviors.

Result: EgoCogNav successfully captures perceived uncertainties correlating with behaviors like scanning, hesitation, and backtracking, while generalizing to new environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset advance the understanding of human navigation behaviors and offer tools for studying navigation in diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Modeling the cognitive and experiential factors of human navigation is central to deepening our understanding of human-environment interaction and to enabling safe social navigation and effective assistive wayfinding. Most existing methods focus on forecasting motions in fully observed scenes and often neglect human factors that capture how people feel and respond to space. To address this gap, We propose EgoCogNav, a multimodal egocentric navigation framework that predicts perceived path uncertainty as a latent state and jointly forecasts trajectories and head motion by fusing scene features with sensory cues. To facilitate research in the field, we introduce the Cognition-aware Egocentric Navigation (CEN) dataset consisting 6 hours of real-world egocentric recordings capturing diverse navigation behaviors in real-world scenarios. Experiments show that EgoCogNav learns the perceived uncertainty that highly correlates with human-like behaviors such as scanning, hesitation, and backtracking while generalizing to unseen environments.

### [483] [GateRA: Token-Aware Modulation for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17582)
*Jie Ou,Shuaihong Jiang,Yingjun Du,Cees G. M. Snoek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GateRA introduces token-level adaptive updates for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), outperforming existing methods in addressing varying input challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods like LoRA apply static, input-agnostic adaptations to all tokens, failing to account for the varying difficulty of inputs, which can lead to inefficiencies like overfitting or under-adaptation.

Method: GateRA incorporates adaptive gating into PEFT branches for dynamic token-aware adjustments. It uses entropy-based regularization for interpretable, sparse adaptations and provides theoretical insights on gradient-masking effects.

Result: GateRA achieves superior performance on commonsense reasoning benchmarks, outperforming or matching prior PEFT techniques.

Conclusion: GateRA effectively improves PEFT by dynamically focusing on challenging inputs while preserving pre-trained knowledge, showcasing its adaptability and efficiency.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, DoRA, and HiRA, enable lightweight adaptation of large pre-trained models via low-rank updates. However, existing PEFT approaches apply static, input-agnostic updates to all tokens, disregarding the varying importance and difficulty of different inputs. This uniform treatment can lead to overfitting on trivial content or under-adaptation on more informative regions, especially in autoregressive settings with distinct prefill and decoding dynamics. In this paper, we propose GateRA, a unified framework that introduces token-aware modulation to dynamically adjust the strength of PEFT updates. By incorporating adaptive gating into standard PEFT branches, GateRA enables selective, token-level adaptation, preserving pre-trained knowledge for well-modeled inputs while focusing capacity on challenging cases. Empirical visualizations reveal phase-sensitive behaviors, where GateRA automatically suppresses updates for redundant prefill tokens while emphasizing adaptation during decoding. To promote confident and efficient modulation, we further introduce an entropy-based regularization that encourages near-binary gating decisions. This regularization prevents diffuse update patterns and leads to interpretable, sparse adaptation without hard thresholding. Finally, we present a theoretical analysis showing that GateRA induces a soft gradient-masking effect over the PEFT path, enabling continuous and differentiable control over adaptation. Experiments on multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that GateRA consistently outperforms or matches prior PEFT methods.

*Chenrui Ma,Xi Xiao,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Straight Variational Flow Matching (S-VFM), aiming to enhance one-step generation by enforcing trajectory straightness and leveraging a variational latent code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching techniques fail at one-step generation due to reliance on curved trajectories, and current fixes face instability, errors, and convergence issues.

Method: The proposed method, S-VFM, introduces a variational latent code into Flow Matching to enforce linear generation paths.

Result: S-VFM outperforms current methods in training and inference efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy across benchmarks.

Conclusion: S-VFM effectively resolves Flow Matching's limitations by promoting efficient, straight trajectory learning for improved one-step generation.

Abstract: Flow Matching has limited ability in achieving one-step generation due to its reliance on learned curved trajectories. Previous studies have attempted to address this limitation by either modifying the coupling distribution to prevent interpolant intersections or introducing consistency and mean-velocity modeling to promote straight trajectory learning. However, these approaches often suffer from discrete approximation errors, training instability, and convergence difficulties. To tackle these issues, in the present work, we propose \textbf{S}traight \textbf{V}ariational \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching (\textbf{S-VFM}), which integrates a variational latent code representing the ``generation overview'' into the Flow Matching framework. \textbf{S-VFM} explicitly enforces trajectory straightness, ideally producing linear generation paths. The proposed method achieves competitive performance across three challenge benchmarks and demonstrates advantages in both training and inference efficiency compared with existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAG-AD, a benchmark for anomaly detection on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) and evaluates methods like unsupervised GNNs and zero-shot LLMs for anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection on TAGs is underexplored due to the lack of standardized datasets, and real-world applications like fraud detection and misinformation demand efficient solutions.

Method: TAG-AD generates realistic text-based anomalies using LLMs and evaluates anomaly detection methods, including a proposed RAG-assisted zero-shot framework for LLMs.

Result: Experimental results show LLMs excel at detecting contextual anomalies, while GNNs perform better at structural anomalies. RAG-assisted prompting matches human-designed prompts without manual engineering.

Conclusion: TAG-AD offers a standardized benchmark for TAG anomaly detection, and RAG-assisted LLM frameworks eliminate prompt engineering, aiding real-world applications with effective anomaly detection.

Abstract: Anomaly detection on attributed graphs plays an essential role in applications such as fraud detection, intrusion monitoring, and misinformation analysis. However, text-attributed graphs (TAGs), in which node information is expressed in natural language, remain underexplored, largely due to the absence of standardized benchmark datasets. In this work, we introduce TAG-AD, a comprehensive benchmark for anomaly node detection on TAGs. TAG-AD leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic anomalous node texts directly in the raw text space, producing anomalies that are semantically coherent yet contextually inconsistent and thus more reflective of real-world irregularities. In addition, TAG-AD incorporates multiple other anomaly types, enabling thorough and reproducible evaluation of graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods. With these datasets, we further benchmark existing unsupervised GNN-based GAD methods as well as zero-shot LLMs for GAD.
  As part of our zero-shot detection setup, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-assisted, LLM-based zero-shot anomaly detection framework. The framework mitigates reliance on brittle, hand-crafted prompts by constructing a global anomaly knowledge base and distilling it into reusable analysis frameworks. Our experimental results reveal a clear division of strengths: LLMs are particularly effective at detecting contextual anomalies, whereas GNN-based methods remain superior for structural anomaly detection. Moreover, RAG-assisted prompting achieves performance comparable to human-designed prompts while eliminating manual prompt engineering, underscoring the practical value of our RAG-assisted zero-shot LLM anomaly detection framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an efficient approach to Path Integration (PI) for Brain-Inspired Navigation (BIN), leveraging lightweight artificial neural networks to replicate neurodynamic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the efficiency and practicality of computational Path Integration (PI) methods in Brain-Inspired Navigation (BIN) by addressing redundancy in existing models.

Method: Uses lightweight Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to replicate Head Direction Cell (HDC) and Grid Cell (GC) patterns, integrating them for Dead Reckoning (DR) navigation.

Result: Demonstrates replicated navigation cell neurodynamic patterns, matches NeuroSLAM positioning accuracy, and achieves efficiency improvements (17.5% on general devices; 40~50% on edge devices).

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances BIN efficiency and practicality. It serves as a novel strategy with potential broader extensions for navigation systems.

Abstract: The brain's Path Integration (PI) mechanism offers substantial guidance and inspiration for Brain-Inspired Navigation (BIN). However, the PI capability constructed by the Continuous Attractor Neural Networks (CANNs) in most existing BIN studies exhibits significant computational redundancy, and its operational efficiency needs to be improved; otherwise, it will not be conducive to the practicality of BIN technology. To address this, this paper proposes an efficient PI approach using representation learning models to replicate CANN neurodynamic patterns. This method successfully replicates the neurodynamic patterns of CANN-modeled Head Direction Cells (HDCs) and Grid Cells (GCs) using lightweight Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These ANN-reconstructed HDC and GC models are then integrated to achieve brain-inspired PI for Dead Reckoning (DR). Benchmark tests in various environments, compared with the well-known NeuroSLAM system, demonstrate that this work not only accurately replicates the neurodynamic patterns of navigation cells but also matches NeuroSLAM in positioning accuracy. Moreover, efficiency improvements of approximately 17.5% on the general-purpose device and 40~50% on the edge device were observed, compared with NeuroSLAM. This work offers a novel implementation strategy to enhance the practicality of BIN technology and holds potential for further extension.

*Kang He,Boyu Chen,Yuzhe Ding,Fei Li,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes PaSE, a novel framework combining calibration learning and Shapley-based optimization to enhance multimodal sentiment analysis by addressing modality competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of modality competition in multimodal sentiment analysis, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones, reducing the overall performance.

Method: PaSE involves Prototype-guided Calibration Learning (PCL) for aligning representations with Entropic Optimal Transport and introduces Dual-Phase Optimization, including a prototype-gated fusion module and Shapley-based Gradient Modulation.

Result: Experiments on datasets like IEMOCAP, MOSI, and MOSEI demonstrate superior performance in multimodal sentiment analysis, effectively reducing modality competition.

Conclusion: PaSE successfully improves multimodal sentiment analysis by balancing and integrating modalities more effectively, offering a robust way to address modality competition and enhancing performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by integrating textual, acoustic, and visual signals. Although multimodal fusion is designed to leverage cross-modal complementarity, real-world scenarios often exhibit modality competition: dominant modalities tend to overshadow weaker ones, leading to suboptimal performance.In this paper, we propose PaSE, a novel Prototype-aligned Calibration and Shapley-optimized Equilibrium framework, which enhances collaboration while explicitly mitigating modality competition. PaSE first applies Prototype-guided Calibration Learning (PCL) to refine unimodal representations and align them through an Entropic Optimal Transport mechanism that ensures semantic consistency. To further stabilize optimization, we introduce a Dual-Phase Optimization strategy. A prototype-gated fusion module is first used to extract shared representations, followed by Shapley-based Gradient Modulation (SGM), which adaptively adjusts gradients according to the contribution of each modality. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP, MOSI, and MOSEI confirm that PaSE achieves the superior performance and effectively alleviates modality competition.

*Yuxuan Hu,Jian Chen,Yuhao Wang,Zixuan Li,Jing Xiong,Pengyue Jia,Wei Wang,Chengming Li,Xiangyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper tackles the Sticker Response Selection task by proposing a model, EIGML, which combines emotional and intentional modeling to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SRS methods fail to effectively combine emotions and intentions, leading to mismatched sticker selection.

Method: The EIGML framework jointly models emotions and intentions using a Dual-Level Contrastive Framework and an Intention-Emotion Guided Multi-Modal Fusion module.

Result: Experimental validation proves EIGML outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two datasets, confirming better emotional and intentional understanding.

Conclusion: EIGML improves sticker selection accuracy by deeply integrating emotion and intention insights, offering advancements in SRS tasks.

Abstract: Stickers are widely used in online communication to convey emotions and implicit intentions. The Sticker Response Selection (SRS) task aims to select the most contextually appropriate sticker based on the dialogue. However, existing methods typically rely on semantic matching and model emotional and intentional cues separately, which can lead to mismatches when emotions and intentions are misaligned. To address this issue, we propose Emotion and Intention Guided Multi-Modal Learning (EIGML). This framework is the first to jointly model emotion and intention, effectively reducing the bias caused by isolated modeling and significantly improving selection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce Dual-Level Contrastive Framework to perform both intra-modality and inter-modality alignment, ensuring consistent representation of emotional and intentional features within and across modalities. In addition, we design an Intention-Emotion Guided Multi-Modal Fusion module that integrates emotional and intentional information progressively through three components: Emotion-Guided Intention Knowledge Selection, Intention-Emotion Guided Attention Fusion, and Similarity-Adjusted Matching Mechanism. This design injects rich, effective information into the model and enables a deeper understanding of the dialogue, ultimately enhancing sticker selection performance. Experimental results on two public SRS datasets show that EIGML consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy and a better understanding of emotional and intentional features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges related to phase-state mismatch and block-wise divergence in decentralized federated learning where peer-to-peer communication creates instability in aggregation.

Method: Introducing ADF-LoRA, which alternates one low-rank matrix per round and mixes matrices to maintain stability and suppress cross-term interference in decentralized setups. Includes convergence analysis and experimental comparison.

Result: ADF-LoRA enhances convergence, stability, and accuracy across multiple GLUE tasks, outperforming existing methods consistently.

Conclusion: By addressing stability and mismatched states in decentralized FL, ADF-LoRA offers a robust solution for federated fine-tuning, improving performance and consistency.

Abstract: This paper revisits alternating low-rank updates for federated fine-tuning and examines their behavior in decentralized federated learning (DFL). While alternating the LoRA matrices has been shown to stabilize aggregation in centralized FL, extending this mechanism to decentralized, peer-to-peer communication introduces new challenges due to phase-state mismatch and block-wise divergence across clients. We introduce ADF-LoRA, which synchronizes the update of only one low-rank matrix per round and mixes both matrices to maintain more consistent parameter states under decentralized propagation. This design preserves the cross-term suppression effect of alternating updates while improving stability in serverless topologies. We provide a convergence analysis under standard smoothness assumptions and evaluate ADF-LoRA on multiple GLUE tasks. Experiments show that ADF-LoRA achieves faster and smoother convergence and delivers the highest average accuracy across tasks, outperforming existing LoRA variants in decentralized FL by a consistent margin.

Motivation: The aim is to improve storage efficiency through advanced predictive capabilities while addressing concerns about data provenance and intellectual property.

Method: Llamazip leverages LLaMA3's language modeling to compress text by saving only unpredictable tokens and investigates the effects of quantization and context window size.

Result: Llamazip significantly reduces data storage requirements and identifies if a document was part of a language model's training dataset.

Conclusion: Llamazip optimizes storage without sacrificing data integrity and fosters transparency in dataset usage.

Abstract: This work introduces Llamazip, a novel lossless text compression algorithm based on the predictive capabilities of the LLaMA3 language model. Llamazip achieves significant data reduction by only storing tokens that the model fails to predict, optimizing storage efficiency without compromising data integrity. Key factors affecting its performance, including quantization and context window size, are analyzed, revealing their impact on compression ratios and computational requirements. Beyond compression, Llamazip demonstrates the potential to identify whether a document was part of the training dataset of a language model. This capability addresses critical concerns about data provenance, intellectual property, and transparency in language model training.

*Mengdi Wang,Efe Bozkir,Enkelejda Kasneci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CycleSL is an aggregation-free split learning framework aiming to improve scalability and performance in distributed model training while minimizing server overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing split learning methods face issues like poor scalability, high server resource overhead, and reduced performance due to factors such as client drift and lag.

Method: CycleSL introduces cyclical updates where the server-side model is trained as a separate task, utilizing resampled client-extracted features to address heterogeneity and ensure better convergence.

Result: CycleSL shows improved performance and scalability, as validated through experiments on five public datasets with non-iid data and partial client involvement.

Conclusion: CycleSL effectively addresses the limitations of traditional split learning approaches, demonstrating its potential in collaborative model training and compatibility with existing methods.

Abstract: Split learning emerges as a promising paradigm for collaborative distributed model training, akin to federated learning, by partitioning neural networks between clients and a server without raw data exchange. However, sequential split learning suffers from poor scalability, while parallel variants like parallel split learning and split federated learning often incur high server resource overhead due to model duplication and aggregation, and generally exhibit reduced model performance and convergence owing to factors like client drift and lag. To address these limitations, we introduce CycleSL, a novel aggregation-free split learning framework that enhances scalability and performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods. Inspired by alternating block coordinate descent, CycleSL treats server-side training as an independent higher-level machine learning task, resampling client-extracted features (smashed data) to mitigate heterogeneity and drift. It then performs cyclical updates, namely optimizing the server model first, followed by client updates using the updated server for gradient computation. We integrate CycleSL into previous algorithms and benchmark them on five publicly available datasets with non-iid data distribution and partial client attendance. Our empirical findings highlight the effectiveness of CycleSL in enhancing model performance. Our source code is available at https://gitlab.lrz.de/hctl/CycleSL.

*Ke Yu,Shigeru Ishikura,Yukari Usukura,Yuki Shigoku,Teruaki Hayashi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SHAP Distance, a novel metric for evaluating semantic fidelity of synthetic tabular data, addressing gaps in existing evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation practices for synthetic tabular data lack the ability to assess semantic fidelity, which determines if synthetic data-based models follow reasoning patterns similar to those trained on real data.

Method: The authors propose SHAP Distance as an explainability-aware metric, which uses cosine distance between global SHAP attribution vectors obtained from classifiers trained on real and synthetic datasets.

Result: SHAP Distance is shown to reliably identify semantic discrepancies in datasets from healthcare, enterprise operations, and telecom that are missed by statistical and predictive measures.

Conclusion: SHAP Distance serves as an effective tool for auditing semantic fidelity, and its integration into benchmarking pipelines can improve the evaluation of synthetic tabular data.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data, which are widely used in domains such as healthcare, enterprise operations, and customer analytics, are increasingly evaluated to ensure that they preserve both privacy and utility. While existing evaluation practices typically focus on distributional similarity (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence) or predictive performance (e.g., Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) accuracy), these approaches fail to assess semantic fidelity, that is, whether models trained on synthetic data follow reasoning patterns consistent with those trained on real data. To address this gap, we introduce the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) Distance, a novel explainability-aware metric that is defined as the cosine distance between the global SHAP attribution vectors derived from classifiers trained on real versus synthetic datasets. By analyzing datasets that span clinical health records with physiological features, enterprise invoice transactions with heterogeneous scales, and telecom churn logs with mixed categorical-numerical attributes, we demonstrate that the SHAP Distance reliably identifies semantic discrepancies that are overlooked by standard statistical and predictive measures. In particular, our results show that the SHAP Distance captures feature importance shifts and underrepresented tail effects that the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real accuracy fail to detect. This study positions the SHAP Distance as a practical and discriminative tool for auditing the semantic fidelity of synthetic tabular data, and offers practical guidelines for integrating attribution-based evaluation into future benchmarking pipelines.

*Mincheol Jeon,Euinam Huh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSTAR is a style-aware federated learning framework designed to address challenges like domain heterogeneity, data imbalance, and communication constraints. It achieves better personalization and robustness by combining content-style disentanglement with attention-driven prototype aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional federated learning struggles with domain heterogeneity, data imbalance, and lacks personalization, resulting in biased predictions for clients with varying data distributions.

Method: FedSTAR employs content-style disentanglement to extract style and content representations and uses a Transformer-based attention mechanism for adaptive prototype aggregation. It exchanges prototypes and style vectors instead of full model parameters to reduce communication overhead.

Result: FedSTAR improves personalization, robustness in heterogeneous environments, and reduces communication cost, as demonstrated through experimental results.

Conclusion: By leveraging disentanglement and attention mechanisms, FedSTAR addresses persistent PFL challenges, offering enhanced personalization and efficient communication in diverse federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) faces persistent challenges, including domain heterogeneity from diverse client data, data imbalance due to skewed participation, and strict communication constraints. Traditional federated learning often lacks personalization, as a single global model cannot capture client-specific characteristics, leading to biased predictions and poor generalization, especially for clients with highly divergent data distributions.
  To address these issues, we propose FedSTAR, a style-aware federated learning framework that disentangles client-specific style factors from shared content representations. FedSTAR aggregates class-wise prototypes using a Transformer-based attention mechanism, allowing the server to adaptively weight client contributions while preserving personalization.
  Furthermore, by exchanging compact prototypes and style vectors instead of full model parameters, FedSTAR significantly reduces communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that combining content-style disentanglement with attention-driven prototype aggregation improves personalization and robustness in heterogeneous environments without increasing communication cost.

Motivation: To explore the capability of RL in addressing complex and less structured problems, particularly in replicating aspects of human cognition.

Method: Investigated the performance of state-of-the-art RL methods (PPO, behavioral cloning, imitation learning) and applied curriculum learning based on human experiment insights.

Result: Initial RL methods struggled to learn optimal strategies for the 3D task, but curriculum learning successfully enabled effective learning.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning, informed by human experiments, is a promising approach to enhance RL's capability in solving complex visuospatial tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a mature technology, often suggested as a potential route towards Artificial General Intelligence, with the ambitious goal of replicating the wide range of abilities found in natural and artificial intelligence, including the complexities of human cognition. While RL had shown successes in relatively constrained environments, such as the classic Atari games and specific continuous control problems, recent years have seen efforts to expand its applicability. This work investigates the potential of RL in demonstrating intelligent behaviour and its progress in addressing more complex and less structured problem domains.
  We present an investigation into the capacity of modern RL frameworks in addressing a seemingly straightforward 3D Same-Different visuospatial task. While initial applications of state-of-the-art methods, including PPO, behavioural cloning and imitation learning, revealed challenges in directly learning optimal strategies, the successful implementation of curriculum learning offers a promising avenue. Effective learning was achieved by strategically designing the lesson plan based on the findings of a real-world human experiment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Non-stationary and Varying-discounting MDP (NVMDP) framework to address challenges of non-stationarity and finite-horizon tasks in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing formulations of Markov Decision Processes assume stationarity and may not adequately handle non-stationary environments or finite-horizon tasks.

Method: Develop NVMDPs, establish their theoretical foundation including optimality conditions, and adapt algorithms like dynamic programming and Q-learning. Extend Policy Gradient Theorem and TRPO for function approximation use cases.

Result: NVMDP algorithms, proven theoretically and through empirical evaluations, outperform traditional Q-learning by recovering optimal policies in non-stationary environments.

Conclusion: NVMDPs are a robust, flexible framework for addressing non-stationarity and policy shaping with minimal changes to existing RL algorithms.

Abstract: Algorithms developed under stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) often face challenges in non-stationary environments, and infinite-horizon formulations may not directly apply to finite-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce the Non-stationary and Varying-discounting MDP (NVMDP) framework, which naturally accommodates non-stationarity and allows discount rates to vary with time and transitions. Infinite-horizon, stationary MDPs emerge as special cases of NVMDPs for identifying an optimal policy, and finite-horizon MDPs are also subsumed within the NVMDP formulations. Moreover, NVMDPs provide a flexible mechanism to shape optimal policies, without altering the state space, action space, or the reward structure. We establish the theoretical foundations of NVMDPs, including assumptions, state- and action-value formulation and recursion, matrix representation, optimality conditions, and policy improvement under finite state and action spaces. Building on these results, we adapt dynamic programming and generalized Q-learning algorithms to NVMDPs, along with formal convergence proofs. For problems requiring function approximation, we extend the Policy Gradient Theorem and the policy improvement bound in Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), offering proofs in both scalar and matrix forms. Empirical evaluations in a non-stationary gridworld environment demonstrate that NVMDP-based algorithms successfully recover optimal trajectories under multiple reward and discounting schemes, whereas original Q-learning fails. These results collectively show that NVMDPs provide a theoretically sound and practically effective framework for reinforcement learning, requiring only minor algorithmic modifications while enabling robust handling of non-stationarity and explicit optimal policy shaping.

### [496] [From Projection to Prediction: Beyond Logits for Scalable Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17599)
*Jianbing Dong,Jianbin Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimized method to reduce memory usage and increase speed in LLMs training by combining output projection and loss computation into one operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient training of Large Language Models faces challenges due to memory and bandwidth limitations caused by intermediate logits tensor computation.

Method: A novel approach combines output projection and loss prediction into a single step, bypassing explicit logits tensor materialization.

Result: Experiments show significant memory savings and speed improvements, allowing larger batch sizes and longer sequences during training without any accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The work redefines the training pipeline for LLMs, providing a systems optimization that enhances scalability and efficiency in LLM training workflows.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) typically involves a two-stage pipeline at the output layer: hidden states are projected into vocabulary logits via a linear transformation (lm_head), followed by cross-entropy loss computation against target tokens. While conceptually simple, this design incurs substantial overhead. The intermediate logits tensor, with dimensions proportional to batch size, sequence length, and vocabulary size, must be fully materialized in GPU memory, even though only one target token per position is ultimately used. This leads to significant memory footprint and bandwidth comsumption, limiting scalability and slowing training throughput.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach to integrates the output projection and loss prediction into a single operation. By directly computing the loss from hidden states and target tokens, our approach bypasses explicit logits materialization. This design reduces memory usage and alleviates bandwidth pressure. Experiments on LLM training demonstrate that our method achieves substantial memory savings and measurable speedups compared to the standard two-stage pipeline, enabling large batch sizes and longer sequences without sacrificing accuracy. Our work highlights the benefits of rethinking the boundary between projection and prediction, offering a practical systems optimization for efficient LLM training.

### [497] [Generalizable and Efficient Automated Scoring with a Knowledge-Distilled Multi-Task Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17601)
*Luyang Fang,Tao Wang,Ping Ma,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniMoE-Guided is presented as a highly efficient multi-task automated scoring model, combining a shared encoder, a gated mixture-of-experts block, and lightweight task heads, achieving comparable task-specific performance while significantly reducing storage and computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in automated scoring systems where separate models per task lead to high computational resource usage, storage demands, and maintenance complexities in educational contexts.

Method: The proposed method involves knowledge distillation into one model, utilizing a shared encoder, a gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) block, and lightweight task-specific heads, trained with ground-truth labels and teacher guidance for improved cross-task performance.

Result: UniMoE-Guided matches the performance of task-specific models while reducing storage requirements by approximately 6× compared to separate models and 87× compared to a 20B-parameter teacher model.

Conclusion: This approach enables efficient, scalable, and reliable automated scoring systems, with enhanced transfer and adaptability to new tasks, suitable for educational assessments in classrooms and large-scale settings.

Abstract: Automated scoring of written constructed responses typically relies on separate models per task, straining computational resources, storage, and maintenance in real-world education settings. We propose UniMoE-Guided, a knowledge-distilled multi-task Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach that transfers expertise from multiple task-specific large models (teachers) into a single compact, deployable model (student). The student combines (i) a shared encoder for cross-task representations, (ii) a gated MoE block that balances shared and task-specific processing, and (iii) lightweight task heads. Trained with both ground-truth labels and teacher guidance, the student matches strong task-specific models while being far more efficient to train, store, and deploy. Beyond efficiency, the MoE layer improves transfer and generalization: experts develop reusable skills that boost cross-task performance and enable rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal additions and tuning. On nine NGSS-aligned science-reasoning tasks (seven for training/evaluation and two held out for adaptation), UniMoE-Guided attains performance comparable to per-task models while using $\sim$6$\times$ less storage than maintaining separate students, and $87\times$ less than the 20B-parameter teacher. The method offers a practical path toward scalable, reliable, and resource-efficient automated scoring for classroom and large-scale assessment systems.

### [498] [Beyond Surface-Level Similarity: Hierarchical Contamination Detection for Synthetic Training Data in Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17602)
*Sushant Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to detect semantic-level contamination in synthetic data used for foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating foundation models is compromised by benchmark contamination, especially at the semantic level where existing methods fail.

Method: A hierarchical contamination detection framework with four levels: token, semantic, reasoning pattern, and performance cliff detection.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves semantic contamination detection (F1 = 0.76), outperforming existing methods by an average of 26.5%.

Conclusion: The framework aids responsible deployment of synthetic training data by enhancing contamination detection and maintaining evaluation integrity.

Abstract: Synthetic data has become essential for training foundation models, yet benchmark contamination threatens evaluation integrity. Although existing detection methods identify token-level overlap, they fail to detect semantic-level contamination where synthetic data conceptually resemble benchmarks without lexical overlap. This gap is critical as foundation models increasingly train on synthetic data that may implicitly encode benchmark knowledge. We propose a hierarchical contamination detection framework operating at four levels: token level, semantic level, reasoning pattern, and performance cliff detection. Through controlled experiments on MMLU, GSM8K and HumanEval, we demonstrate that semantic-level contamination evades existing methods (F1=0.17-0.49) but is effectively detected by our hierarchical approach (F1 = 0.76), with an average improvement of 26. 5\% over state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework provides practitioners with practical tools for audit pipelines and enables responsible deployment of synthetic training data.

### [499] [BrainHGT: A Hierarchical Graph Transformer for Interpretable Brain Network Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17604)
*Jiajun Ma,Yongchao Zhang,Chao Zhang,Zhao Lv,Shengbing Pei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BrainHGT, a Hierarchical Graph Transformer for brain network analysis, emphasizing the brain's modular and hierarchical structures for improved disease prediction and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing brain network models, which ignore the hierarchical and modular architecture of the brain, as well as distance-related node connection patterns.

Method: The proposed BrainHGT features a long-short range attention encoder to model both dense local and sparse long-range interactions, and a prior-guided clustering module that groups brain regions into functional communities using neuroanatomical priors.

Result: The model significantly outperforms existing methods in disease identification tasks and successfully identifies biologically plausible sub-functional brain modules, proving its interpretability.

Conclusion: BrainHGT provides a more biologically realistic and interpretable framework for brain network modeling, facilitating better understanding and clinical applications in brain disorders.

Abstract: Graph Transformer shows remarkable potential in brain network analysis due to its ability to model graph structures and complex node relationships. Most existing methods typically model the brain as a flat network, ignoring its modular structure, and their attention mechanisms treat all brain region connections equally, ignoring distance-related node connection patterns. However, brain information processing is a hierarchical process that involves local and long-range interactions between brain regions, interactions between regions and sub-functional modules, and interactions among functional modules themselves. This hierarchical interaction mechanism enables the brain to efficiently integrate local computations and global information flow, supporting the execution of complex cognitive functions. To address this issue, we propose BrainHGT, a hierarchical Graph Transformer that simulates the brain's natural information processing from local regions to global communities. Specifically, we design a novel long-short range attention encoder that utilizes parallel pathways to handle dense local interactions and sparse long-range connections, thereby effectively alleviating the over-globalizing issue. To further capture the brain's modular architecture, we designe a prior-guided clustering module that utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to group brain regions into functional communities and leverage neuroanatomical prior to guide the clustering process, thereby improving the biological plausibility and interpretability. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method significantly improves performance of disease identification, and can reliably capture the sub-functional modules of the brain, demonstrating its interpretability.

*Agnideep Aich,Sameera Hewage,Md Monzur Murshed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study integrates clinical and genomic machine learning models using copula-based fusion to improve breast cancer risk stratification, showing better identification of high-risk subgroups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance breast cancer outcome predictions by addressing the limitations of using simple linear combinations of clinical and genomic risk scores without considering their interdependence.

Method: Utilized the METABRIC breast cancer cohort to develop supervised classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for clinical and genomic predictors, and employed copula models to capture the joint relationship between these scores for improved stratification.

Result: Clinical models performed better (AUC 0.783) than genomic models (AUC 0.681). The Gaussian copula most effectively modeled joint distribution, revealing distinct high-risk subgroups with significantly poorer survival outcomes.

Conclusion: Copula-based integration of clinical and genomic risk scores is effective, highlighting the potential for better identification of worst-prognosis patient subgroups in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Clinical and genomic models are both used to predict breast cancer outcomes, but they are often combined using simple linear rules that do not account for how their risk scores relate, especially at the extremes. Using the METABRIC breast cancer cohort, we studied whether directly modeling the joint relationship between clinical and genomic machine learning risk scores could improve risk stratification for 5-year cancer-specific mortality. We created a binary 5-year cancer-death outcome and defined two sets of predictors: a clinical set (demographic, tumor, and treatment variables) and a genomic set (gene-expression $z$-scores). We trained several supervised classifiers, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and used 5-fold cross-validated predicted probabilities as unbiased risk scores. These scores were converted to pseudo-observations on $(0,1)^2$ to fit Gaussian, Clayton, and Gumbel copulas. Clinical models showed good discrimination (AUC 0.783), while genomic models had moderate performance (AUC 0.681). The joint distribution was best captured by a Gaussian copula (bootstrap $p=0.997$), which suggests a symmetric, moderately strong positive relationship. When we grouped patients based on this relationship, Kaplan-Meier curves showed clear differences: patients who were high-risk in both clinical and genomic scores had much poorer survival than those high-risk in only one set. These results show that copula-based fusion works in real-world cohorts and that considering dependencies between scores can better identify patient subgroups with the worst prognosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to overcome the limitations in computational neuroscience modeling, balancing between efficiency and fidelity, enabling advancements in therapeutic interventions and neural engineering applications.

Method: The paper employs an energy-based transformer with latent space learning using strictly proper scoring rules to model neural temporal dynamics, providing efficient generation methods.

Result: EAG achieves state-of-the-art generation quality and efficiency on synthetic datasets and benchmark neural datasets. It also demonstrates capabilities like generalizing to unseen contexts and improving motor brain-computer interface decoding using synthetic data.

Conclusion: EAG framework proves effective for modeling neural population dynamics, advancing neuroscience research and engineering applications. Code is openly available.

Abstract: Understanding brain function represents a fundamental goal in neuroscience, with critical implications for therapeutic interventions and neural engineering applications. Computational modeling provides a quantitative framework for accelerating this understanding, but faces a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and high-fidelity modeling. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Energy-based Autoregressive Generation (EAG) framework that employs an energy-based transformer learning temporal dynamics in latent space through strictly proper scoring rules, enabling efficient generation with realistic population and single-neuron spiking statistics. Evaluation on synthetic Lorenz datasets and two Neural Latents Benchmark datasets (MC_Maze and Area2_bump) demonstrates that EAG achieves state-of-the-art generation quality with substantial computational efficiency improvements, particularly over diffusion-based methods. Beyond optimal performance, conditional generation applications show two capabilities: generalizing to unseen behavioral contexts and improving motor brain-computer interface decoding accuracy using synthetic neural data. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of energy-based modeling for neural population dynamics with applications in neuroscience research and neural engineering.

*Kartheek Bondugula,Santiago Mazuelas,Aritz Pérez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient learning algorithm for classification tasks called minimax risk classifiers (MRCs) using constraint and column generation, achieving notable speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the efficiency of minimax risk classifiers (MRCs), which are not compatible with stochastic subgradient methods for large-scale multi-class classification tasks.

Method: Introduced a constraint and column generation-based learning algorithm to handle MRCs effectively.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieved up to a 10x speedup for general large-scale datasets and up to a 100x speedup with a large number of classes.

Conclusion: The algorithm significantly enhances the efficiency of MRCs, making them suitable for large-scale multi-class classification problems.

Abstract: Supervised learning with large-scale data usually leads to complex optimization problems, especially for classification tasks with multiple classes. Stochastic subgradient methods can enable efficient learning with a large number of samples for classification techniques that minimize the average loss over the training samples. However, recent techniques, such as minimax risk classifiers (MRCs), minimize the maximum expected loss and are not amenable to stochastic subgradient methods. In this paper, we present a learning algorithm based on the combination of constraint and column generation that enables efficient learning of MRCs with large-scale data for classification tasks with multiple classes. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm provides upto a 10x speedup for general large-scale data and around a 100x speedup with a sizeable number of classes.

### [503] [Finding Pre-Injury Patterns in Triathletes from Lifestyle, Recovery and Load Dynamics Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17610)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework combining synthetic data generation and machine learning to predict injury risks for triathlon athletes, integrating holistic factors like sleep and stress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current injury prediction lacks consideration for crucial lifestyle factors (sleep, stress) that influence recovery and injury susceptibility.

Method: A synthetic data framework was developed to simulate personalized athlete profiles and training programs, integrating physiological and lifestyle variables. Machine learning models (LASSO, Random Forest, XGBoost) were trained on this data for injury prediction.

Result: The models achieved high predictive performance (AUC up to 0.86) and identified sleep disturbances, heart rate variability, and stress as essential indicators of injury risks.

Conclusion: Integrating lifestyle factors with wearable-driven methods improves injury prediction, offering a practical, data-informed tool for athlete monitoring and injury prevention.

Abstract: Triathlon training, which involves high-volume swimming, cycling, and running, places athletes at substantial risk for overuse injuries due to repetitive physiological stress. Current injury prediction approaches primarily rely on training load metrics, often neglecting critical factors such as sleep quality, stress, and individual lifestyle patterns that significantly influence recovery and injury susceptibility.
  We introduce a novel synthetic data generation framework tailored explicitly for triathlon. This framework generates physiologically plausible athlete profiles, simulates individualized training programs that incorporate periodization and load-management principles, and integrates daily-life factors such as sleep quality, stress levels, and recovery states. We evaluated machine learning models (LASSO, Random Forest, and XGBoost) showing high predictive performance (AUC up to 0.86), identifying sleep disturbances, heart rate variability, and stress as critical early indicators of injury risk. This wearable-driven approach not only enhances injury prediction accuracy but also provides a practical solution to overcoming real-world data limitations, offering a pathway toward a holistic, context-aware athlete monitoring.

*Lucía Schmidt-Santiago,David Rodríguez-Temporal,Carlos Sevilla-Salcedo,Vanessa Gómez-Verdejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores using deep generative models to synthesize realistic MALDI-TOF MS spectra, aiming to address data scarcity for microbial diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to overcome limitations in developing diagnostic models for clinical microbiology due to the lack of large, balanced, and standardized MALDI-TOF MS spectral datasets.

Method: Three deep generative models—MALDIVAE, MALDIGAN, and MALDIffusion—are adapted for conditional generation of microbial spectra, guided by species labels. Their fidelity and diversity are evaluated using multiple metrics.

Result: All models generate synthetic spectra comparable to real data, enabling classifiers trained on synthetic samples to perform effectively. MALDIVAE shows the best balance of realism and efficiency, while MALDIffusion achieves high fidelity at a higher computational cost.

Conclusion: Synthetic spectra can mitigate data scarcity, improve classification accuracy for minority species, and support robust machine learning applications in microbiology without compromising data authenticity.

Abstract: Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has become a cornerstone technology in clinical microbiology, enabling rapid and accurate microbial identification. However, the development of data-driven diagnostic models remains limited by the lack of sufficiently large, balanced, and standardized spectral datasets. This study investigates the use of deep generative models to synthesize realistic MALDI-TOF MS spectra, aiming to overcome data scarcity and support the development of robust machine learning tools in microbiology.
  We adapt and evaluate three generative models, Variational Autoencoders (MALDIVAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (MALDIGANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MALDIffusion), for the conditional generation of microbial spectra guided by species labels. Generation is conditioned on species labels, and spectral fidelity and diversity are assessed using diverse metrics.
  Our experiments show that synthetic data generated by MALDIVAE, MALDIGAN, and MALDIffusion are statistically and diagnostically comparable to real measurements, enabling classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic samples to reach performance levels similar to those trained on real data. While all models faithfully reproduce the peak structure and variability of MALDI-TOF spectra, MALDIffusion obtains this fidelity at a substantially higher computational cost, and MALDIGAN shows competitive but slightly less stable behaviour. In contrast, MALDIVAE offers the most favorable balance between realism, stability, and efficiency. Furthermore, augmenting minority species with synthetic spectra markedly improves classification accuracy, effectively mitigating class imbalance and domain mismatch without compromising the authenticity of the generated data.

*Justin Diamond,Markus Lill*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves that a denoising diffusion sampler can be interpreted as an Euler-Maruyama integrator for overdamped Langevin dynamics, enabling a novel, data-driven approach to molecular dynamics (MD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between diffusion models and molecular dynamics, enabling a data-driven framework to model systems while bypassing traditional and limiting MD methodologies like fixed small time steps and hand-engineered force fields.

Method: The authors interpret reverse denoising steps in diffusion samplers as stochastic differential equations, with adjustable parameters like model capacity and denoising steps, to control accuracy and simulate MD-like behaviors.

Result: The framework achieves MD-equivalent accuracy without relying on trajectory data or fixed force fields, whilst preserving the Boltzmann distribution and reproducing MD-like temporal correlations.

Conclusion: This approach significantly advances molecular dynamics simulation by being entirely data-driven, with scalable parameters, leveraging static equilibrium snapshots instead of traditional trajectory data or force fields.

Abstract: We prove that a denoising diffusion sampler equipped with a sequential bias across the batch dimension is exactly an Euler-Maruyama integrator for overdamped Langevin dynamics. Each reverse denoising step, with its associated spring stiffness, can be interpreted as one step of a stochastic differential equation with an effective time step set jointly by the noise schedule and that stiffness. The learned score then plays the role of the drift, equivalently the gradient of a learned energy, yielding a precise correspondence between diffusion sampling and Langevin time evolution.
  This equivalence recasts molecular dynamics (MD) in terms of diffusion models. Accuracy is no longer tied to a fixed, extremely small MD time step; instead, it is controlled by two scalable knobs: model capacity, which governs how well the drift is approximated, and the number of denoising steps, which sets the integrator resolution. In practice, this leads to a fully data-driven MD framework that learns forces from uncorrelated equilibrium snapshots, requires no hand-engineered force fields, uses no trajectory data for training, and still preserves the Boltzmann distribution associated with the learned energy.
  We derive trajectory-level, information-theoretic error bounds that cleanly separate discretization error from score-model error, clarify how temperature enters through the effective spring, and show that the resulting sampler generates molecular trajectories with MD-like temporal correlations, even though the model is trained only on static configurations.

Abstract: This paper introduces Tensor Gauge Flow Models, a new class of Generative Flow Models that generalize Gauge Flow Models and Higher Gauge Flow Models by incorporating higher-order Tensor Gauge Fields into the Flow Equation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for smoothed agnostic learning of Boolean halfspaces, using random bit flips for discrete domains. The authors provide an efficient algorithm under subexponential input distribution assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agnostic learning in Boolean halfspaces is computationally hard even for weak learning under traditional settings. Current frameworks using Gaussian perturbations are unsuitable for discrete domains, creating a need for a discrete-focused method.

Method: The paper models perturbations via random bit flips to create a discrete analogue of smoothed optimality. They present an algorithm with sample complexity and runtime of approximately n raised to a poly(1/(sigma * epsilon)) factor under subexponential input distribution assumptions.

Result: An efficient algorithm is presented for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces in discrete settings, using weaker assumptions compared to prior work, where only strong structural conditions allowed success.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between intractable worst-case scenarios and practical learnability of Boolean halfspaces in discrete domains like the Boolean hypercube, offering computationally efficient guarantees for learning.

Abstract: Agnostic learning of Boolean halfspaces is a fundamental problem in computational learning theory, but it is known to be computationally hard even for weak learning. Recent work [CKKMK24] proposed smoothed analysis as a way to bypass such hardness, but existing frameworks rely on additive Gaussian perturbations, making them unsuitable for discrete domains. We introduce a new smoothed agnostic learning framework for Boolean inputs, where perturbations are modeled via random bit flips. This defines a natural discrete analogue of smoothed optimality generalizing the Gaussian case. Under strictly subexponential assumptions on the input distribution, we give an efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces in this model, with runtime and sample complexity approximately n raised to a poly(1/(sigma * epsilon)) factor. Previously, such algorithms were known only with strong structural assumptions for the discrete hypercube, for example, independent coordinates or symmetric distributions. Our result provides the first computationally efficient guarantee for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces over the Boolean hypercube, bridging the gap between worst-case intractability and practical learnability in discrete settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NH-GCAT, a framework combining neuroscience domain knowledge and deep learning to improve depression classification using neuroimaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance depression diagnosis accuracy while introducing neurobiological interpretability, addressing the limitations of current data-driven, black-box approaches.

Method: The framework includes three components: a residual gated fusion module for local brain region analysis, a hierarchical circuit encoding for inter-regional circuits, and a causal attention mechanism for multi-circuit network interactions.

Result: NH-GCAT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 73.3% accuracy and 76.4% AUROC on the REST-meta-MDD dataset, demonstrating improved diagnostic capability.

Conclusion: The NH-GCAT model effectively bridges neuroscience and machine learning, providing robust diagnostics and neurobiological insights, advancing research in depression classification.

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), affecting millions worldwide, exhibits complex pathophysiology manifested through disrupted brain network dynamics. Although graph neural networks that leverage neuroimaging data have shown promise in depression diagnosis, existing approaches are predominantly data-driven and operate largely as black-box models, lacking neurobiological interpretability. Here, we present NH-GCAT (Neurocircuitry-Inspired Hierarchical Graph Causal Attention Networks), a novel framework that bridges neuroscience domain knowledge with deep learning by explicitly and hierarchically modeling depression-specific mechanisms at different spatial scales. Our approach introduces three key technical contributions: (1) at the local brain regional level, we design a residual gated fusion module that integrates temporal blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics with functional connectivity patterns, specifically engineered to capture local depression-relevant low-frequency neural oscillations; (2) at the multi-regional circuit level, we propose a hierarchical circuit encoding scheme that aggregates regional node representations following established depression neurocircuitry organization, and (3) at the multi-circuit network level, we develop a variational latent causal attention mechanism that leverages a continuous probabilistic latent space to infer directed information flow among critical circuits, characterizing disease-altered whole-brain inter-circuit interactions. Rigorous leave-one-site-out cross-validation on the REST-meta-MDD dataset demonstrates NH-GCAT's state-of-the-art performance in depression classification, achieving a sample-size weighted-average accuracy of 73.3\% and an AUROC of 76.4\%, while simultaneously providing neurobiologically meaningful explanations.

*Lyu Yuhuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a new sample complexity bound for verifying uniform conditions over continuous spaces, achieving a logarithmic rather than linear dependence on failure probability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the conservativeness of classical coverage analyses in machine learning and control theory, particularly in high-confidence regimes with small failure probabilities.

Method: The authors use a concentration inequality applied to an uncovered-count statistic to derive a sample complexity bound, and compare the result under standard Lipschitz and uniformity assumptions.

Result: The derived sample complexity bound achieves a logarithmic dependence on failure probability and is numerically shown to scale favorably, offering improved practical coverage for grid-based algorithms.

Conclusion: This approach sharpens theoretical coverage tools, making sampling more efficient under high-confidence requirements and potentially benefiting algorithms dependent on grid-based guarantees.

Abstract: Verifying uniform conditions over continuous spaces through random sampling is fundamental in machine learning and control theory, yet classical coverage analyses often yield conservative bounds, particularly at small failure probabilities. We study uniform random sampling on the $d$-dimensional unit hypercube and analyze the number of uncovered subcubes after discretization. By applying a concentration inequality to the uncovered-count statistic, we derive a sample complexity bound with a logarithmic dependence on the failure probability ($δ$), i.e., $M =O( \tilde{C}\ln(\frac{2\tilde{C}}δ))$, which contrasts sharply with the classical linear $1/δ$ dependence. Under standard Lipschitz and uniformity assumptions, we present a self-contained derivation and compare our result with classical coupon-collector rates. Numerical studies across dimensions, precision levels, and confidence targets indicate that our bound tracks practical coverage requirements more tightly and scales favorably as $δ\to 0$. Our findings offer a sharper theoretical tool for algorithms that rely on grid-based coverage guarantees, enabling more efficient sampling, especially in high-confidence regimes.

*Haoran Li,Zhe Cheng,Muhao Guo,Yang Weng,Yannan Sun,Victor Tran,John Chainaranont*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents M2OE2-GL, a scalable global-to-local probabilistic load forecasting approach to efficiently address heterogeneity and maintain high accuracy across large-scale distribution feeders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently forecasting electricity loads at scale without compromising on prediction accuracy, particularly in the presence of heterogeneity among loads across large distribution feeders.

Method: The authors propose and evaluate M2OE2-GL, which involves training a global probabilistic forecaster (M2OE2) and fine-tuning lightweight group-specific forecasters to balance scalability and precision.

Result: M2OE2-GL achieves substantial error reductions in probabilistic load forecasting on realistic utility data while being computationally efficient for large-scale deployment.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that M2OE2-GL successfully overcomes the scalability and heterogeneity challenges, offering a practical and efficient solution for large-scale distribution feeder forecasting.

Abstract: Probabilistic load forecasting is widely studied and underpins power system planning, operation, and risk-aware decision making. Deep learning forecasters have shown strong ability to capture complex temporal and contextual patterns, achieving substantial accuracy gains. However, at the scale of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of loads in large distribution feeders, a deployment dilemma emerges: training and maintaining one model per customer is computationally and storage intensive, while using a single global model ignores distributional shifts across customer types, locations, and phases. Prior work typically focuses on single-load forecasters, global models across multiple loads, or adaptive/personalized models for relatively small settings, and rarely addresses the combined challenges of heterogeneity and scalability in large feeders. We propose M2OE2-GL, a global-to-local extension of the M2OE2 probabilistic forecaster. We first pretrain a single global M2OE2 base model across all feeder loads, then apply lightweight fine-tuning to derive a compact family of group-specific forecasters.

### [511] [Semi-Supervised Federated Multi-Label Feature Selection with Fuzzy Information Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17796)
*Afsaneh Mahanipour,Hana Khamfroush*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SSFMLFS, a method for feature selection in distributed and federated environments, particularly addressing cases with limited labeled data at the server and unlabeled data at clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-label feature selection methods require centralized data or labeled data at clients, making them unsuitable for federated or distributed environments with data privacy concerns and unlabeled data.

Method: SSFMLFS utilizes fuzzy information theory where clients compute fuzzy similarity matrices, transmit these to the server, which calculates feature relevancy and redundancy. A feature graph is constructed, and PageRank is applied to rank the importance of features.

Result: The proposed approach shows superior performance over existing federated, centralized supervised, and semi-supervised methods across different domains using three evaluation metrics under non-IID data conditions.

Conclusion: SSFMLFS is effective for multi-label feature selection in federated frameworks with unlabeled data on clients and limited labeled data at the server, boosting model performance in privacy-preserving environments.

Abstract: Multi-label feature selection (FS) reduces the dimensionality of multi-label data by removing irrelevant, noisy, and redundant features, thereby boosting the performance of multi-label learning models. However, existing methods typically require centralized data, which makes them unsuitable for distributed and federated environments where each device/client holds its own local dataset. Additionally, federated methods often assume that clients have labeled data, which is unrealistic in cases where clients lack the expertise or resources to label task-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose a Semi-Supervised Federated Multi-Label Feature Selection method, called SSFMLFS, where clients hold only unlabeled data, while the server has limited labeled data. SSFMLFS adapts fuzzy information theory to a federated setting, where clients compute fuzzy similarity matrices and transmit them to the server, which then calculates feature redundancy and feature-label relevancy degrees. A feature graph is constructed by modeling features as vertices, assigning relevancy and redundancy degrees as vertex weights and edge weights, respectively. PageRank is then applied to rank the features by importance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from various domains, including biology, images, music, and text, demonstrate that SSFMLFS outperforms other federated and centralized supervised and semi-supervised approaches in terms of three different evaluation metrics in non-IID data distribution setting.

### [512] [QML-HCS: A Hypercausal Quantum Machine Learning Framework for Non-Stationary Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17624)
*Hector E Mozo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QML-HCS is a framework for quantum-inspired machine learning leveraging hypercausal feedback dynamics to adapt to non-stationary environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning models struggle to adapt in non-stationary environments due to the lack of mechanisms for continuous causal adaptation and coherence updates.

Method: QML-HCS utilizes quantum-inspired superposition, dynamic causal feedback, and a hybrid deterministic-stochastic execution to achieve adaptive behavior and enable state preservation without full retraining.

Result: The framework demonstrates adaptability to shifts in input distributions, preserving causal consistency, and provides a Python-based interface for experimentation.

Conclusion: QML-HCS sets foundational groundwork for advancing machine learning with hypercausal reasoning and paves the way for future integration with classical and quantum platforms.

Abstract: QML-HCS is a research-grade framework for constructing and analyzing quantum-inspired machine learning models operating under hypercausal feedback dynamics. Hypercausal refers to AI systems that leverage extended, deep, or nonlinear causal relationships (expanded causality) to reason, predict, and infer states beyond the capabilities of traditional causal models. Current machine learning and quantum-inspired systems struggle in non-stationary environments, where data distributions drift and models lack mechanisms for continuous adaptation, causal stability, and coherent state updating. QML-HCS addresses this limitation through a unified computational architecture that integrates quantum-inspired superposition principles, dynamic causal feedback, and deterministic-stochastic hybrid execution to enable adaptive behavior in changing environments.
  The framework implements a hypercausal processing core capable of reversible transformations, multipath causal propagation, and evaluation of alternative states under drift. Its architecture incorporates continuous feedback to preserve causal consistency and adjust model behavior without requiring full retraining. QML-HCS provides a reproducible and extensible Python interface backed by efficient computational routines, enabling experimentation in quantum-inspired learning, causal reasoning, and hybrid computation without the need for specialized hardware.
  A minimal simulation demonstrates how a hypercausal model adapts to a sudden shift in the input distribution while preserving internal coherence. This initial release establishes the foundational architecture for future theoretical extensions, benchmarking studies, and integration with classical and quantum simulation platforms.

### [513] [High-Accuracy List-Decodable Mean Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17822)
*Ziyun Chen,Spencer Compton,Daniel Kane,Jerry Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates high-accuracy list-decodable learning for data with an α-fraction from a specific distribution, achieving significant theoretical and algorithmic results in list-decodable mean estimation of Gaussians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for list-decodable learning achieve optimal list sizes but struggle with errors decaying poorly with respect to 1/α. The paper investigates whether list size can be traded for higher accuracy in recovering information from the distribution.

Method: The authors propose information-theoretic guarantees and an algorithm for the list-decodable mean estimation of Gaussians, introducing novel proofs of identifiability and algorithmic techniques not based on the sum-of-squares hierarchy.

Result: They show that a candidate list of size $\exp(O(\frac{\log^2 1 / \alpha}{\epsilon^2}))$ ensures at least one element is within $\ell_2$ distance ε of the true mean, with computational runtime and sample complexity detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The paper establishes the possibility of trading list size for higher accuracy in list-decodable learning, contributing new methods and proofs that advance understanding and algorithm design in this domain.

Abstract: In list-decodable learning, we are given a set of data points such that an $α$-fraction of these points come from a nice distribution $D$, for some small $α\ll 1$, and the goal is to output a short list of candidate solutions, such that at least one element of this list recovers some non-trivial information about $D$. By now, there is a large body of work on this topic; however, while many algorithms can achieve optimal list size in terms of $α$, all known algorithms must incur error which decays, in some cases quite poorly, with $1 / α$. In this paper, we ask if this is inherent: is it possible to trade off list size with accuracy in list-decodable learning? More formally, given $ε> 0$, can we can output a slightly larger list in terms of $α$ and $ε$, but so that one element of this list has error at most $ε$ with the ground truth? We call this problem high-accuracy list-decodable learning. Our main result is that non-trivial high-accuracy guarantees, both information-theoretically and algorithmically, are possible for the canonical setting of list-decodable mean estimation of identity-covariance Gaussians. Specifically, we demonstrate that there exists a list of candidate means of size at most $L = \exp \left( O\left( \tfrac{\log^2 1 / α}{ε^2} \right)\right)$ so that one of the elements of this list has $\ell_2$ distance at most $ε$ to the true mean. We also design an algorithm that outputs such a list with runtime and sample complexity $n = d^{O(\log L)} + \exp \exp (\widetilde{O}(\log L))$. We do so by demonstrating a completely novel proof of identifiability, as well as a new algorithmic way of leveraging this proof without the sum-of-squares hierarchy, which may be of independent technical interest.

### [514] [A novel k-means clustering approach using two distance measures for Gaussian data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17823)
*Naitik Gada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modified k-means algorithm that uses both within-cluster distance (WCD) and inter-cluster distance (ICD) to enhance clustering results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the robustness and accuracy of clustering analysis by refining traditional k-means clustering techniques.

Method: The algorithm incorporates WCD and ICD metrics into the clustering process and uses the Calinski-Harabasz criterion to determine the number of clusters. It is tested on synthetic and benchmark UCI datasets.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates improved clustering accuracy, better handling of outliers, and enhanced convergence compared to standard k-means.

Conclusion: Integrating WCD and ICD into the clustering process results in more robust and precise data cluster formation, paving the way for future research in this area.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms have long been the topic of research, representing the more popular side of unsupervised learning. Since clustering analysis is one of the best ways to find some clarity and structure within raw data, this paper explores a novel approach to \textit{k}-means clustering. Here we present a \textit{k}-means clustering algorithm that takes both the within cluster distance (WCD) and the inter cluster distance (ICD) as the distance metric to cluster the data into \emph{k} clusters pre-determined by the Calinski-Harabasz criterion in order to provide a more robust output for the clustering analysis. The idea with this approach is that by including both the measurement metrics, the convergence of the data into their clusters becomes solidified and more robust. We run the algorithm with some synthetically produced data and also some benchmark data sets obtained from the UCI repository. The results show that the convergence of the data into their respective clusters is more accurate by using both WCD and ICD measurement metrics. The algorithm is also better at clustering the outliers into their true clusters as opposed to the traditional \textit{k} means method. We also address some interesting possible research topics that reveal themselves as we answer the questions we initially set out to address.

### [515] [Rectifying Mean-Shift in Cascaded Precipitation Nowcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17628)
*Fanbo Ju,Haiyuan Shi,Qingjian Ni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RectiCast, a new framework to improve precipitation nowcasting by addressing distribution shifts and improving details through a dual Flow Matching model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and reliability of precipitation nowcasting by addressing the shortcomings in existing methods, particularly the distribution shift between deterministic and probabilistic models.

Method: RectiCast is a two-stage framework: (1) A deterministic model predicts the posterior mean; (2) A Rectifier corrects the mean-field distribution shift, and a Generator models local stochasticity based on the rectified mean using a dual Flow Matching model.

Result: The proposed RectiCast outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on SEVIR and MeteoNet datasets in both accuracy and capturing precipitation details.

Conclusion: Explicitly addressing distribution shift in precipitation nowcasting improves forecast accuracy and provides a more reliable approach compared to existing cascaded architectures.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which aims to provide high spatio-temporal resolution precipitation forecasts by leveraging current radar observations, is a core task in regional weather forecasting. The cascaded architecture has emerged as the mainstream paradigm for deep learning-based precipitation nowcasting. This paradigm involves a deterministic model to predict macroscopic trends (or posterior mean), followed by a probabilistic model to generate local details (or local stochasticity). However, existing methods commonly overlook the conflation of the systematic distribution shift in deterministic predictions and the local stochasticity. As a result, the deterministic component's distribution shift contaminates the predictions of the probabilistic component, leading to inaccuracies in precipitation patterns and intensity, particularly over longer lead times. To address this issue, we introduce RectiCast, a two-stage framework that explicitly decouples the correction of mean-field shift from the generation of local stochasticity via a dual Flow Matching model. In the first stage, a deterministic model generates the posterior mean. In the second stage, we introduce a Rectifier to explicitly learn the distribution shift and produce a rectified mean. Subsequently, a Generator focuses on modeling the local stochasticity conditioned on the rectified mean. Experiments on SEVIR and MeteoNet demonstrate that RectiCast achieves significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [516] [Deterministic Inference across Tensor Parallel Sizes That Eliminates Training-Inference Mismatch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17826)
*Ziyang Zhang,Xinheng Ding,Jiayi Yuan,Rixin Liu,Huizi Mao,Jiarong Xing,Zirui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the non-determinism in LLM inference across varying tensor parallel sizes and proposes Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK) to ensure bit-wise reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of deterministic inference in applications such as LLM-based evaluations and reinforcement learning, which require consistency in outputs across varying computational configurations.

Method: The authors introduce Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK), which align intra- and inter-GPU reduction orders using a hierarchical binary tree structure, enabling deterministic matrix multiplication across different tensor parallel sizes.

Result: The proposed TBIK achieves zero probability divergence and bit-wise identical results across variable tensor parallel sizes. It ensures reproducible RL training between vLLM and FSDP with different parallel strategies.

Conclusion: Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK) provide a robust solution to deterministic inference challenges in LLMs, offering reproducibility across computational setups and improving RL training outcomes.

Abstract: Deterministic inference is increasingly critical for large language model (LLM) applications such as LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, multi-agent systems, and Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, existing LLM serving frameworks exhibit non-deterministic behavior: identical inputs can yield different outputs when system configurations (e.g., tensor parallel (TP) size, batch size) vary, even under greedy decoding. This arises from the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic and inconsistent reduction orders across GPUs. While prior work has addressed batch-size-related nondeterminism through batch-invariant kernels, determinism across different TP sizes remains an open problem, particularly in RL settings, where the training engine typically uses Fully Sharded Data Parallel (i.e., TP = 1) while the rollout engine relies on multi-GPU TP to maximize the inference throughput, creating a natural mismatch between the two. This precision mismatch problem may lead to suboptimal performance or even collapse for RL training. We identify and analyze the root causes of TP-induced inconsistency and propose Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK), a set of TP-invariant matrix multiplication and reduction primitives that guarantee bit-wise identical results regardless of TP size. Our key insight is to align intra- and inter-GPU reduction orders through a unified hierarchical binary tree structure. We implement these kernels in Triton and integrate them into vLLM and FSDP. Experiments confirm zero probability divergence and bit-wise reproducibility for deterministic inference across different TP sizes. Also, we achieve bit-wise identical results between vLLM and FSDP in RL training pipelines with different parallel strategy. Code is available at https://github.com/nanomaoli/llm_reproducibility.

*Yanxuan Yu,Michael S. Hughes,Julien Lee,Jiacheng Zhou,Andrew F. Laine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AF-SMOTE, a data augmentation technique improving classification performance under extreme class imbalance, showing success in medical diagnosis and fraud detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification in scenarios with extreme class imbalance, where recall and calibration are critical, especially for sensitive domains like medical diagnosis.

Method: The authors propose AF-SMOTE, combining synthetic minority point generation with filtering steps using an adversarial discriminator and boundary utility model. Mathematical guarantees ensure improved performance without sacrificing calibration.

Result: Experiments on datasets such as MIMIC-IV and fraud detection benchmarks exhibit higher recall, average precision, and better calibration for AF-SMOTE compared to established oversampling techniques.

Conclusion: AF-SMOTE is a promising tool for improving classification outcomes in imbalanced settings, particularly in healthcare applications, effectively addressing recall and calibration issues.

Abstract: We study classification under extreme class imbalance where recall and calibration are both critical, for example in medical diagnosis scenarios. We propose AF-SMOTE, a mathematically motivated augmentation framework that first synthesizes minority points and then filters them by an adversarial discriminator and a boundary utility model. We prove that, under mild assumptions on the decision boundary smoothness and class-conditional densities, our filtering step monotonically improves a surrogate of F_beta (for beta >= 1) while not inflating Brier score. On MIMIC-IV proxy label prediction and canonical fraud detection benchmarks, AF-SMOTE attains higher recall and average precision than strong oversampling baselines (SMOTE, ADASYN, Borderline-SMOTE, SVM-SMOTE), and yields the best calibration. We further validate these gains across multiple additional datasets beyond MIMIC-IV. Our successful application of AF-SMOTE to a healthcare dataset using a proxy label demonstrates in a disease-agnostic way its practical value in clinical situations, where missing true positive cases in rare diseases can have severe consequences.

### [518] [Transformers with RL or SFT Provably Learn Sparse Boolean Functions, But Differently](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17852)
*Bochen Lyu,Yiyang Jia,Xiaohao Cai,Zhanxing Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the learning dynamics of fine-tuning transformers via reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with intermediate supervision akin to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. It reveals sufficient conditions for provable learning and highlights distinct learning behaviors between RL and SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers demonstrate reasoning capabilities using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies, yet the mechanisms behind different fine-tuning methods like RL and SFT remain unclear. This paper explores these dynamics theoretically.

Method: The authors examine transformers learning $k$-sparse Boolean functions (recursively decomposable) using RL and SFT with intermediate supervision for CoT reasoning. They analyze cases such as $k$-PARITY, $k$-AND, and $k$-OR to derive sufficient conditions for successful learning.

Result: The study shows that RL learns the CoT chain holistically, while SFT learns it incrementally. It confirms the learnability of transformers using these approaches for specific Boolean functions under sufficient conditions.

Conclusion: The research provides theoretical understanding of RL and SFT mechanisms in enabling CoT capabilities in transformers and establishes their distinct learning patterns when applied to recursive Boolean functions.

Abstract: Transformers can acquire Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities to solve complex reasoning tasks through fine-tuning. Reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) are two primary approaches to this end, yet their underlying mechanisms and differences remain theoretically unclear. In this work, we examine these aspects specifically for learning $k$-sparse Boolean functions with a one-layer transformer and intermediate supervision that is akin to CoT. In particular, we consider $k$-sparse Boolean functions that can be recursively decomposed into fixed 2-sparse Boolean functions. We analyze the learning dynamics of fine-tuning the transformer via either RL or SFT with CoT to identify sufficient conditions for it to provably learn these functions. We verify that these conditions hold for three basic examples, including $k$-PARITY, $k$-AND, and $k$-OR, thus demonstrating the learnability of both approaches. Notably, we reveal that RL and SFT exhibit distinct learning behaviors: RL learns the whole CoT chain simultaneously, whereas SFT learns the CoT chain step-by-step. Overall, our findings provide theoretical insights into the underlying mechanisms of RL and SFT as well as how they differ in triggering the CoT capabilities of transformers.

*Nele Albers,Esra Cemre Su de Groot,Loes Keijsers,Manon H. Hillegers,Emiel Krahmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) for generating samples that can mimic user interactions for training reinforcement learning models in digital health behavior change applications. Results suggest LLMs can be a cost-effective substitute for real data and human raters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve engagement and effectiveness of digital health applications by personalizing and adapting interventions to users' changing behaviors, but the design process is costly and challenging.

Method: Used LLMs to generate user interaction samples and compared them to real user data from behavior change studies and samples from human raters. Analyzed prompting strategies to optimize sample generation.

Result: LLM samples were effective substitutes for real data, matching human raters' performance. Relative effectiveness of LLM prompting strategies varied across studies, showing potential for cost-effective application.

Conclusion: LLM-generated samples can be a useful tool for developing and training reinforcement learning models in the absence of real data, with guidance on optimal use of prompting strategies.

Abstract: Personalizing digital applications for health behavior change is a promising route to making them more engaging and effective. This especially holds for approaches that adapt to users and their specific states (e.g., motivation, knowledge, wants) over time. However, developing such approaches requires making many design choices, whose effectiveness is difficult to predict from literature and costly to evaluate in practice. In this work, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can be used out-of-the-box to generate samples of user interactions that provide useful information for training reinforcement learning models for digital behavior change settings. Using real user data from four large behavior change studies as comparison, we show that LLM-generated samples can be useful in the absence of real data. Comparisons to the samples provided by human raters further show that LLM-generated samples reach the performance of human raters. Additional analyses of different prompting strategies including shorter and longer prompt variants, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot prompting show that the relative effectiveness of different strategies depends on both the study and the LLM with also relatively large differences between prompt paraphrases alone. We provide recommendations for how LLM-generated samples can be useful in practice.

*Xuesong Jia,Yuanjie Shi,Ziquan Liu,Yi Xu,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-sensitive conformal training algorithm improving predictive efficiency by reducing prediction set sizes by 21.38%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CP methods use surrogate functions for uncertainty quantification, which leads to non-uniform error bounds and uncontrollable learning efficiency.

Method: The authors propose minimizing expected prediction set size via rank weighting strategy based on the rank of true labels, eliminating reliance on approximation mechanisms.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates theoretical tightness in aligning the learning objective and achieves a 21.38% reduction in average prediction set sizes compared to other conformal training methods.

Conclusion: The introduced method enhances conformal prediction’s efficiency with validated theory and consistent superior empirical performance.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a general framework to quantify the predictive uncertainty of machine learning models that uses a set prediction to include the true label with a valid probability. To align the uncertainty measured by CP, conformal training methods minimize the size of the prediction sets. A typical way is to use a surrogate indicator function, usually Sigmoid or Gaussian error function. However, these surrogate functions do not have a uniform error bound to the indicator function, leading to uncontrollable learning bounds. In this paper, we propose a simple cost-sensitive conformal training algorithm that does not rely on the indicator approximation mechanism. Specifically, we theoretically show that minimizing the expected size of prediction sets is upper bounded by the expected rank of true labels. To this end, we develop a rank weighting strategy that assigns the weight using the rank of true label on each data sample. Our analysis provably demonstrates the tightness between the proposed weighted objective and the expected size of conformal prediction sets. Extensive experiments verify the validity of our theoretical insights, and superior empirical performance over other conformal training in terms of predictive efficiency with 21.38% reduction for average prediction set size.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Enhanced Federated Deep Multi-View Clustering (EFDMVC) to tackle view and aggregation uncertainties in federated multi-view clustering with heterogeneous and incomplete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address dual uncertainties in federated multi-view clustering: semantic inconsistency from arbitrary view pairings and imbalanced client updates with heterogeneous view completeness.

Method: EFDMVC introduces hierarchical contrastive fusion to resolve view uncertainty, a view adaptive drift module for global-local correction, and balanced aggregation to coordinate clients.

Result: EFDMVC consistently achieves superior robustness and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: EFDMVC effectively handles view and aggregation uncertainties in federated multi-view clustering, enhancing robustness and accuracy in real-world incomplete and heterogeneous data setups.

Abstract: Traditional Federated Multi-View Clustering assumes uniform views across clients, yet practical deployments reveal heterogeneous view completeness with prevalent incomplete, redundant, or corrupted data. While recent approaches model view heterogeneity, they neglect semantic conflicts from dynamic view combinations, failing to address dual uncertainties: view uncertainty (semantic inconsistency from arbitrary view pairings) and aggregation uncertainty (divergent client updates with imbalanced contributions). To address these, we propose a novel Enhanced Federated Deep Multi-View Clustering framework: first align local semantics, hierarchical contrastive fusion within clients resolves view uncertainty by eliminating semantic conflicts; a view adaptive drift module mitigates aggregation uncertainty through global-local prototype contrast that dynamically corrects parameter deviations; and a balanced aggregation mechanism coordinates client updates. Experimental results demonstrate that EFDMVC achieves superior robustness against heterogeneous uncertain views across multiple benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming all state-of-the-art baselines in comprehensive evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ad-recommendation systems struggle with computational and noise issues while processing entire user-engagement histories.

Method: The paper proposes Dynamix, leveraging self-supervised learning with Event Based Features (EBFs) to optimize processing, remove noise, and boost targeted features based on user segments.

Result: Dynamix demonstrates increased training and inference throughput (1.15% and 1.8% respectively), improved prediction accuracy (0.033 NE gains), and increased inference efficiency (4.2% higher QPS).

Conclusion: Dynamix achieves notable efficiency and performance improvements in user-sequence-based recommendation models, suggesting potential scalability with advanced resource exploration strategies.

Abstract: For online ad-recommendation systems, processing complete user-ad-engagement histories is both computationally intensive and noise-prone. We introduce Dynamix, a scalable, personalized sequence exploration framework that optimizes event history processing using maximum relevance principles and self-supervised learning through Event Based Features (EBFs). Dynamix categorizes users-engagements at session and surface-levels by leveraging correlations between dwell-times and ad-conversion events. This enables targeted, event-level feature removal and selective feature boosting for certain user-segments, thereby yielding training and inference efficiency wins without sacrificing engaging ad-prediction accuracy. While, dynamic resource removal increases training and inference throughput by 1.15% and 1.8%, respectively, dynamic feature boosting provides 0.033 NE gains while boosting inference QPS by 4.2% over baseline models. These results demonstrate that Dynamix achieves significant cost efficiency and performance improvements in online user-sequence based recommendation models. Self-supervised user-segmentation and resource exploration can further boost complex feature selection strategies while optimizing for workflow and compute resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) perimeter security by proposing a meta-learning framework, DUPLE, to improve event recognition across diverse fiber deployments with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle critical challenges in DFOS systems: variability in signal patterns across fiber deployments, scarcity of labeled data in new scenarios, and difficulty in capturing intra-class diversity within source domains.

Method: The DUPLE framework incorporates three key components: (1) A dual-domain multi-prototype learner to enhance generalization under signal distribution shifts, (2) A Statistical Guided Network (SGN) leveraging raw statistical features to guide learning in new domains, and (3) A query-aware prototype aggregation module for adaptive prototype selection and aggregation.

Result: Experiments on DFOS datasets confirm that DUPLE significantly performs better than baselines in cross-deployment domain generalization, ensuring robust event classification even with limited labeled data.

Conclusion: The proposed DUPLE framework effectively addresses domain shift and data scarcity in DFOS systems, improving perimeter security applications by enabling robust activity identification under diverse configurations.

Abstract: Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) has shown strong potential in perimeter security due to its capability of monitoring vibration events across long distances with fine spatial resolution. However, practical DFOS systems face three critical challenges: (1) signal patterns of the same activity vary drastically under different fiber deployment types (e.g., underground, wall-mounted), causing domain shift; (2) labeled data in new deployment scenarios is often scarce or entirely unavailable, limiting model adaptability; and (3) even within source domains, data scarcity makes it difficult to capture intra-class diversity for robust learning.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, DUPLE, for cross-deployment DFOS activity identification. First, a dual-domain multi-prototype learner fuses temporal and frequency domain features, enhancing the model's generalization ability under signal distribution shifts. Second, a Statistical Guided Network (SGN) infers domain importance and prototype sensitivity from raw statistical features, providing data-driven prior information for learning in unlabeled or unseen domains. Third, a query-aware prototype aggregation module adaptively selects and combines relevant prototypes, thereby improving classification performance even with limited data.
  Extensive experiments on cross-deployment DFOS datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain generalization settings, enabling robust event recognition across diverse fiber configurations with minimal labeled data.

Motivation: To address the challenge of storing and transmitting large LLMs on edge devices, particularly when traditional methods fail at extreme compression without accuracy loss.

Method: The weights of LLMs are compressed into discrete latent vectors via an encoder and represented in a compact codebook. A lightweight decoder network restores these vectors to their original space.

Result: PocketLLM achieves a 10x compression ratio on Llama 2-7B with negligible accuracy drop.

Conclusion: PocketLLM provides an efficient and effective solution for extreme LLM compression, making it suitable for constrained environments.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, storing and transmitting them on edge devices becomes increasingly challenging. Traditional methods like quantization and pruning struggle to achieve extreme compression of LLMs without sacrificing accuracy. In this paper, we introduce PocketLLM, a novel approach to compress LLMs in a latent space via meta-networks. A simple encoder network is proposed to project the weights of LLMs into discrete latent vectors, which are then represented using a compact codebook. A lightweight decoder network is employed to map the codebook's representative vectors back to the original weight space. This method allows for significant compression of the large weights in LLMs, consisting solely of a small decoder, a concise codebook, and an index. Extensive experiments show that PocketLLM achieves superior performance even at significantly high compression ratios, e.g., compressing Llama 2-7B by 10x with a negligible drop in accuracy.

### [526] [Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Streaming Generative and Predictive Learning via Stateful Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17936)
*Wenzhang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies stateful replay methods in streaming learning systems and evaluates their performance compared to sequential fine-tuning under memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in learning systems that must update continuously on streaming data.

Method: The authors unify a framework to analyze stateful replay versus sequential fine-tuning using stochastic gradient approaches, performing gradient alignment analysis and extensive evaluation on multiple datasets and scenarios.

Result: Replay significantly reduces forgetting by 2-3 times in heterogeneous tasks and performs equally well as fine-tuning in time-based tasks, demonstrating its utility.

Conclusion: Stateful replay is a robust and simple option for continual learning in memory-constrained streaming data environments.

Abstract: Many deployed learning systems must update models on streaming data under memory constraints. The default strategy, sequential fine-tuning on each new phase, is architecture-agnostic but often suffers catastrophic forgetting when later phases correspond to different sub-populations or tasks. Replay with a finite buffer is a simple alternative, yet its behaviour across generative and predictive objectives is not well understood. We present a unified study of stateful replay for streaming autoencoding, time series forecasting, and classification. We view both sequential fine-tuning and replay as stochastic gradient methods for an ideal joint objective, and use a gradient alignment analysis to show when mixing current and historical samples should reduce forgetting. We then evaluate a single replay mechanism on six streaming scenarios built from Rotated MNIST, ElectricityLoadDiagrams 2011-2014, and Airlines delay data, using matched training budgets and three seeds. On heterogeneous multi task streams, replay reduces average forgetting by a factor of two to three, while on benign time based streams both methods perform similarly. These results position stateful replay as a strong and simple baseline for continual learning in streaming environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Model-to-Model Knowledge Transmission (M2KT), a data-free method for conceptual knowledge transfer between neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the dependency on large datasets and teacher-generated outputs in current knowledge distillation and transfer learning techniques.

Method: Propose M2KT which operates in concept space rather than example space, leveraging concept embeddings, abstraction graphs, and inter-model alignment to achieve knowledge transfer without labeled datasets.

Result: M2KT achieves 85-90% of teacher model performance while reducing data usage by over 98%, demonstrated through symbolic reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: M2KT provides a novel, efficient, and data-free approach for neural network knowledge transfer, paving the way for self-improving AI models.

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence systems depend heavily on large datasets for both training and transferring knowledge between models. Knowledge distillation, transfer learning, and dataset distillation have made such transfers more efficient, yet they remain fundamentally data-driven: a teacher must produce examples, logits, or gradients for a student to learn. In this work, we introduce Model-to-Model Knowledge Transmission (M2KT), a novel paradigm for data-free conceptual transfer between neural networks. M2KT enables models to exchange knowledge packets that encapsulate structured concept embeddings, abstraction graphs, reasoning traces, and provenance metadata. Unlike classical distillation, M2KT operates primarily in concept space rather than example space, and it does not require labeled datasets or teacher-generated outputs during transfer. We formalize the notion of concept manifolds, introduce an inter-model alignment mapping between teacher and student latent spaces, and derive a composite loss that enforces geometric, structural, and reasoning consistency together with explicit safety constraints. We further present algorithmic procedures for teacher-side packet generation and student-side ingestion and verification. Experiments on symbolic reasoning with large language models show that M2KT can achieve approximately 85 to 90 percent of teacher performance while reducing data usage by over 98 percent compared to standard knowledge distillation. This work establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for data-free AI-to-AI knowledge transfer and self-improving model ecosystems.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a structural causal bandit algorithm integrating information from different datasets and environments to improve learning efficiency with sub-linear regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop intelligent agents that can optimize actions by utilizing causal knowledge and efficiently transferring information across diverse environments and datasets.

Method: Incorporates structural causal bandit framework with transportability of prior knowledge from source environments to improve learning in deployment scenarios.

Result: The proposed bandit algorithm utilizes invariances across environments, achieves sub-linear regret bounds, and outperforms traditional online-learning bandit approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating causal knowledge and transferring information from diverse environments can enhance decision-making efficiency and outperform standard methods.

Abstract: Intelligent agents equipped with causal knowledge can optimize their action spaces to avoid unnecessary exploration. The structural causal bandit framework provides a graphical characterization for identifying actions that are unable to maximize rewards by leveraging prior knowledge of the underlying causal structure. While such knowledge enables an agent to estimate the expected rewards of certain actions based on others in online interactions, there has been little guidance on how to transfer information inferred from arbitrary combinations of datasets collected under different conditions -- observational or experimental -- and from heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we investigate the structural causal bandit with transportability, where priors from the source environments are fused to enhance learning in the deployment setting. We demonstrate that it is possible to exploit invariances across environments to consistently improve learning. The resulting bandit algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound with an explicit dependence on informativeness of prior data, and it may outperform standard bandit approaches that rely solely on online learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of channel-level LTV prediction for sustainable user growth using a novel framework, Trapezoidal Temporal Fusion (TTF). It offers improved accuracy and has been deployed successfully.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Internet companies face difficulties in achieving sustainable growth due to the need for accurate LTV forecasting in early stages to optimize CAC and maximize LTV/CAC ratio.

Method: The authors propose the Trapezoidal Temporal Fusion (TTF) framework with a trapezoidal multi-time series module and MT-FusionNet structure to address unaligned multi-time series, imbalanced short-input long-output (SILO), and volatility in LTV datasets.

Result: Testing on Douyin's online system demonstrated a decrease of MAPEp by 4.3% and MAPEa by 3.2%, showcasing improved prediction accuracy compared to the previous model.

Conclusion: TTF successfully tackles challenges in LTV forecasting, improves prediction precision, and aids budget allocations, contributing to sustainable growth for Internet companies.

Abstract: In the user growth scenario, Internet companies invest heavily in paid acquisition channels to acquire new users. But sustainable growth depends on acquired users' generating lifetime value (LTV) exceeding customer acquisition cost (CAC). In order to maximize LTV/CAC ratio, it is crucial to predict channel-level LTV in an early stage for further optimization of budget allocation. The LTV forecasting problem is significantly different from traditional time series forecasting problems, and there are three main challenges. Firstly, it is an unaligned multi-time series forecasting problem that each channel has a number of LTV series of different activation dates. Secondly, to predict in the early stage, it faces the imbalanced short-input long-output (SILO) challenge. Moreover, compared with the commonly used time series datasets, the real LTV series are volatile and non-stationary, with more frequent fluctuations and higher variance. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Trapezoidal Temporal Fusion (TTF) to address the above challenges. We introduce a trapezoidal multi-time series module to deal with data unalignment and SILO challenges, and output accurate predictions with a multi-tower structure called MT-FusionNet. The framework has been deployed to the online system for Douyin. Compared to the previously deployed online model, MAPEp decreased by 4.3%, and MAPEa decreased by 3.2%, where MAPEp denotes the point-wise MAPE of the LTV curve and MAPEa denotes the MAPE of the aggregated LTV.

*Sandro Andric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BlockCert, a framework for certified extraction and editing of transformer mechanisms, enabling bounds on deviations and machine-checkable guarantees in neural networks. Applied successfully to models like GPT-2 and TinyLlama.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanistic interpretability lacks explicit guarantees for neural network behavior during reverse-engineering, and model editing lacks formal measures for drift upon modification. The paper aims to address these issues with certified methodologies.

Method: BlockCert extracts structured implementations of residual blocks, provides certificates for approximation error and input coverage, and uses a Lipschitz-based theorem to establish global deviation bounds.

Result: BlockCert achieves high coverage and minor residual errors on evaluated prompts for models such as GPT-2 and TinyLlama. A fully stitched TinyLlama model matches baseline perplexity within a small margin.

Conclusion: Blockwise extraction and explicit certification provide feasibility for reverse-engineering real transformer language models, bridging mechanistic interpretability and formal reasoning on model behavior.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aspires to reverse-engineer neural networks into explicit algorithms, while model editing seeks to modify specific behaviours without retraining. Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts. Our results suggest that blockwise extraction with explicit certificates is feasible for real transformer language models and offers a practical bridge between mechanistic interpretability and formal reasoning about model behaviour.

Motivation: Address the challenge of maintaining clustering stability over dynamic environments without reliance on predefined hyperparameters.

Method: Utilizes an ART-based algorithm that autonomously adjusts recalculation intervals and vigilance thresholds via a diversity-driven adaptation mechanism.

Result: Experimental validation on 24 datasets demonstrates superior performance over existing clustering and continual learning methods.

Conclusion: The algorithm effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and achieves consistent clustering in evolving data streams, offering a robust solution for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Clustering in stationary and nonstationary settings, where data distributions remain static or evolve over time, requires models that can adapt to distributional shifts while preserving previously learned cluster structures. This paper proposes an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)-based topological clustering algorithm that autonomously adjusts its recalculation interval and vigilance threshold through a diversity-driven adaptation mechanism. This mechanism enables hyperparameter-free learning that maintains cluster stability and continuity in dynamic environments. Experiments on 24 real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both clustering performance and continual learning capability. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed parameter adaptation in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining consistent clustering in evolving data streams.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD approaches struggle with generating long parametric command sequences due to complex geometric and topological constraints in models.

Method: The authors developed MamTiff-CAD, which integrates Mamba+, Transformer, and a diffusion model to generate and reconstruct long parametric sequences. A novel autoencoder with a forget gate mechanism and a multi-scale transformer is included in their approach.

Result: MamTiff-CAD demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in generating long parametric command sequences (60-256 commands) on both reconstruction and generation tasks.

Conclusion: MamTiff-CAD effectively overcomes challenges in handling long sequence CAD commands, marking a significant advancement for parametric CAD.

Abstract: Parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is crucial in industrial applications, yet existing approaches often struggle to generate long sequence parametric commands due to complex CAD models' geometric and topological constraints. To address this challenge, we propose MamTiff-CAD, a novel CAD parametric command sequences generation framework that leverages a Transformer-based diffusion model for multi-scale latent representations. Specifically, we design a novel autoencoder that integrates Mamba+ and Transformer, to transfer parameterized CAD sequences into latent representations. The Mamba+ block incorporates a forget gate mechanism to effectively capture long-range dependencies. The non-autoregressive Transformer decoder reconstructs the latent representations. A diffusion model based on multi-scale Transformer is then trained on these latent embeddings to learn the distribution of long sequence commands. In addition, we also construct a dataset that consists of long parametric sequences, which is up to 256 commands for a single CAD model. Experiments demonstrate that MamTiff-CAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both reconstruction and generation tasks, confirming its effectiveness for long sequence (60-256) CAD model generation.

TL;DR: The paper enhances differentially private model training by addressing learning rate scheduling with correlated noise, offering improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align differentially private model training with practical scenarios by incorporating learning rate schedules and improving on prior methods that used constant rates.

Method: Development of general upper and lower bounds for various learning rate schedules and proposing a learning-rate-aware factorization method for improved model accuracy.

Result: Novel factorization methods based on learning rate schedules demonstrated improved accuracy in private training on CIFAR-10 and IMDB datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating learning rate schedules with advanced factorizations significantly enhances practical private model training.

Abstract: We study differentially private model training with stochastic gradient descent under learning rate scheduling and correlated noise. Although correlated noise, in particular via matrix factorizations, has been shown to improve accuracy, prior theoretical work focused primarily on the prefix-sum workload. That workload assumes a constant learning rate, whereas in practice learning rate schedules are widely used to accelerate training and improve convergence. We close this gap by deriving general upper and lower bounds for a broad class of learning rate schedules in both single- and multi-epoch settings. Building on these results, we propose a learning-rate-aware factorization that achieves improvements over prefix-sum factorizations under both MaxSE and MeanSE error metrics. Our theoretical analysis yields memory-efficient constructions suitable for practical deployment, and experiments on CIFAR-10 and IMDB datasets confirm that schedule-aware factorizations improve accuracy in private training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Newton's method can offer faster convergence and higher accuracy but is underutilized due to computational costs.

Method: Proposed mixed-precision Newton optimizers and GN_k methods, analyzing finite-precision impacts and enabling efficient computation of second-order derivatives.

Result: Mixed-precision Newton optimizers outperform Adam on regression benchmarks, while GN_k achieves performance similar to full Newton's method with fewer derivative evaluations.

Conclusion: Both methods provide efficient alternatives to first-order techniques, enhancing convergence guarantees and accuracy with lower computational cost.

Abstract: Minimizing loss functions is central to machine-learning training. Although first-order methods dominate practical applications, higher-order techniques such as Newton's method can deliver greater accuracy and faster convergence, yet are often avoided due to their computational cost. This work analyzes the impact of finite-precision arithmetic on Newton steps and establishes a convergence theorem for mixed-precision Newton optimizers, including "quasi" and "inexact" variants. The theorem provides not only convergence guarantees but also a priori estimates of the achievable solution accuracy. Empirical evaluations on standard regression benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform Adam on the Australian and MUSH datasets. The second part of the manuscript introduces GN_k, a generalized Gauss-Newton method that enables partial computation of second-order derivatives. GN_k attains performance comparable to full Newton's method on regression tasks while requiring significantly fewer derivative evaluations.

*Maximilien Dreveton,Matthias Grossglauser,Daichi Kuroda,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a refined approach to hierarchical clustering that overcomes limitations of traditional methods by ensuring validity in the hierarchy, allowing non-binary structures, and addressing sensitivity to linkage functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations in traditional hierarchical clustering methods, which include always producing a hierarchy even when invalid, restricting to binary trees, and high sensitivity to specific linkage functions.

Method: The authors define a valid hierarchy, introduce a partial order over valid hierarchies, and propose a two-step algorithm that constructs binary trees and then prunes them for validity.

Result: The approach identifies the finest valid hierarchy that maximizes consistent information with the data and collapses to a star tree if no hierarchy exists. It demonstrates that classic linkage functions conform to the method's conditions, unlike Ward’s linkage.

Conclusion: This method ensures more accurate and meaningful hierarchical clustering by addressing foundational issues, enabling its broader reliability and application across datasets.

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering seeks to uncover nested structures in data by constructing a tree of clusters, where deeper levels reveal finer-grained relationships. Traditional methods, including linkage approaches, face three major limitations: (i) they always return a hierarchy, even if none exists, (ii) they are restricted to binary trees, even if the true hierarchy is non-binary, and (iii) they are highly sensitive to the choice of linkage function. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing the notion of a valid hierarchy and defining a partial order over the set of valid hierarchies. We prove the existence of a finest valid hierarchy, that is, the hierarchy that encodes the maximum information consistent with the similarity structure of the data set. In particular, the finest valid hierarchy is not constrained to binary structures and, when no hierarchical relationships exist, collapses to a star tree. We propose a simple two-step algorithm that first constructs a binary tree via a linkage method and then prunes it to enforce validity. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the linkage function under which this procedure exactly recovers the finest valid hierarchy, and we show that all linkage functions satisfying these conditions yield the same hierarchy after pruning. Notably, classical linkage rules such as single, complete, and average satisfy these conditions, whereas Ward's linkage fails to do so.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in accurately predicting animal feed intake using longitudinal big data while accounting for environmental conditions.

Method: AI models, including machine learning (XGBoost), were designed using longitudinal cattle data and environmental variables, along with new indices (InComfort and EASI) to assess thermal comfort and intake behavior.

Result: The XGBoost model achieved high prediction accuracy with RMSE of 1.38 kg/day at the animal level and 0.14 kg/(day-animal) at the pen level.

Conclusion: This framework can advance precision livestock management, aiding in resource optimization, feed waste reduction, and climate-adaptive strategies in cattle farming.

Abstract: Advances in technology are transforming sustainable cattle farming practices, with electronic feeding systems generating big longitudinal datasets on individual animal feed intake, offering the possibility for autonomous precision livestock systems. However, the literature still lacks a methodology that fully leverages these longitudinal big data to accurately predict feed intake accounting for environmental conditions. To fill this gap, we developed an AI-based framework to accurately predict feed intake of individual animals and pen-level aggregation. Data from 19 experiments (>16.5M samples; 2013-2024) conducted at Nancy M. Cummings Research Extension & Education Center (Carmen, ID) feedlot facility and environmental data from AgriMet Network weather stations were used to develop two novel environmental indices: InComfort-Index, based solely on meteorological variables, showed good predictive capability for thermal comfort but had limited ability to predict feed intake; EASI-Index, a hybrid index integrating environmental variables with feed intake behavior, performed well in predicting feed intake but was less effective for thermal comfort. Together with the environmental indices, machine learning models were trained and the best-performing machine learning model (XGBoost) accuracy was RMSE of 1.38 kg/day for animal-level and only 0.14 kg/(day-animal) at pen-level. This approach provides a robust AI-based framework for predicting feed intake in individual animals and pens, with potential applications in precision management of feedlot cattle, through feed waste reduction, resource optimization, and climate-adaptive livestock management.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel active learning approach for PDE surrogate modeling that reduces computational cost by selectively acquiring time steps using numerical solvers while predicting others via surrogates, enhancing data efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs are computationally expensive, and surrogate models, while efficient, require substantial training data generation, posing high costs.

Method: The proposed framework uses active learning to selectively identify and simulate the most impactful time steps from numerical solvers while relying on surrogate models for intermediate steps. A new acquisition function estimates utility based on variance reduction.

Result: Experiments on benchmark PDEs such as Burgers' equation and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate substantial performance improvement, reducing both average error and error quantiles compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The method successfully combines active learning with selective surrogate modeling, offering a cost-effective, efficient solution for PDE computations with superior performance and reduced error variability.

Abstract: Accurately solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is critical to understanding complex scientific and engineering phenomena, yet traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive. Surrogate models offer a more efficient alternative, but their development is hindered by the cost of generating sufficient training data from numerical solvers. In this paper, we present a novel framework for active learning (AL) in PDE surrogate modeling that reduces this cost. Unlike the existing AL methods for PDEs that always acquire entire PDE trajectories, our approach strategically generates only the most important time steps with the numerical solver, while employing the surrogate model to approximate the remaining steps. This dramatically reduces the cost incurred by each trajectory and thus allows the active learning algorithm to try out a more diverse set of trajectories given the same budget. To accommodate this novel framework, we develop an acquisition function that estimates the utility of a set of time steps by approximating its resulting variance reduction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers' equation, Korteweg-De Vries equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, and the compressible Navier-Stokes equation. Experiments show that our approach improves performance by large margins over the best existing method. Our method not only reduces average error but also the 99\%, 95\%, and 50\% quantiles of error, which is rare for an AL algorithm. All in all, our approach offers a data-efficient solution to surrogate modeling for PDEs.

Method: Introduced CubeletWorld, a 3D grid-based framework using 'cubelets,' enabling localized embedding of urban data signals for tasks like planning and prediction, and proposed the CubeletWorld State Prediction task.

Result: CubeletWorld demonstrated effective modeling with localized cubelet states, overcoming representation sparsity and scalability issues seen in traditional approaches, achieving improved generalizability and privacy compliance.

Conclusion: CubeletWorld provides a flexible and scalable solution for handling diverse urban data, enabling new applications in urban planning, environmental monitoring, and emergency response.

Abstract: Modern cities produce vast streams of heterogeneous data, from infrastructure maps to mobility logs and satellite imagery. However, integrating these sources into coherent spatial models for planning and prediction remains a major challenge. Existing agent-centric methods often rely on direct environmental sensing, limiting scalability and raising privacy concerns. This paper introduces CubeletWorld, a novel framework for representing and analyzing urban environments through a discretized 3D grid of spatial units called cubelets. This abstraction enables privacy-preserving modeling by embedding diverse data signals, such as infrastructure, movement, or environmental indicators, into localized cubelet states. CubeletWorld supports downstream tasks such as planning, navigation, and occupancy prediction without requiring agent-driven sensing. To evaluate this paradigm, we propose the CubeletWorld State Prediction task, which involves predicting the cubelet state using a realistic dataset containing various urban elements like streets and buildings through this discretized representation. We explore a range of modified core models suitable for our setting and analyze challenges posed by increasing spatial granularity, specifically the issue of sparsity in representation and scalability of baselines. In contrast to existing 3D occupancy prediction models, our cubelet-centric approach focuses on inferring state at the spatial unit level, enabling greater generalizability across regions and improved privacy compliance. Our results demonstrate that CubeletWorld offers a flexible and extensible framework for learning from complex urban data, and it opens up new possibilities for scalable simulation and decision support in domains such as socio-demographic modeling, environmental monitoring, and emergency response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the lack of robust uncertainty quantification methods in quantum machine learning, particularly for providing reliable and trustworthy predictions in the presence of quantum hardware noise.

Method: The paper applies Adaptive Conformal Inference principles to design the Adaptive Quantum Conformal Prediction (AQCP) algorithm, which adjusts prediction sets dynamically to account for time-varying quantum noise and preserves coverage guarantees.

Result: Empirical studies using an IBM quantum processor show that AQCP achieves its target coverage levels and operates more stably compared to earlier quantum conformal prediction methods.

Conclusion: AQCP provides a promising approach to addressing uncertainty quantification in quantum machine learning, ensuring reliable predictions despite the challenges of quantum processor noise.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning seeks to leverage quantum computers to improve upon classical machine learning algorithms. Currently, robust uncertainty quantification methods remain underdeveloped in the quantum domain, despite the critical need for reliable and trustworthy predictions. Recent work has introduced quantum conformal prediction, a framework that produces prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true outcome with user-specified probability. In this work, we formalise how the time-varying noise inherent in quantum processors can undermine conformal guarantees, even when calibration and test data are exchangeable. To address this challenge, we draw on Adaptive Conformal Inference, a method which maintains validity over time via repeated recalibration. We introduce Adaptive Quantum Conformal Prediction (AQCP), an algorithm which preserves asymptotic average coverage guarantees under arbitrary hardware noise conditions. Empirical studies on an IBM quantum processor demonstrate that AQCP achieves target coverage levels and exhibits greater stability than quantum conformal prediction.

Result: The proposed algorithm, tested on ISPD'24 contest benchmarks, achieved up to 40% runtime reduction and only 0.002% degradation in routing quality compared to the state-of-the-art router.

Conclusion: This method demonstrates a significant improvement in runtime and parallelization efficiency with negligible loss of routing quality, making it a scalable and efficient solution for global routing in EDA.

Abstract: Global routing is a critical stage in electronic design automation (EDA) that enables early estimation and optimization of the routability of modern integrated circuits with respect to congestion, power dissipation, and design complexity. Batching is a primary concern in top-performing global routers, grouping nets into manageable sets to enable parallel processing and efficient resource usage. This process improves memory usage, scalable parallelization on modern hardware, and routing congestion by controlling net interactions within each batch. However, conventional batching methods typically depend on heuristics that are computationally expensive and can lead to suboptimal results (oversized batches with conflicting nets, excessive batch counts degrading parallelization, and longer batch generation times), ultimately limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these limitations, a novel batching algorithm enhanced with Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs) is introduced in this paper, enabling more effective parallelization by generating fewer higher-quality batches in less time. The proposed algorithm is tested on the latest ISPD'24 contest benchmarks, demonstrating up to 40% runtime reduction with only 0.002% degradation in routing quality as compared to state-of-the-art router.

*Navneet Singh,Shiva Raj Pokhrel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum architecture improves trajectory forecasting for autonomous driving by aligning inductive biases with road scene structures, achieving strong multi-modal forecast performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurately forecasting multi-modal trajectories in autonomous driving while meeting constraints on compute and latency.

Method: The proposed hybrid quantum approach uses an ego-centric lane-aligned frame, residual corrections to kinematic baselines, quantum attention encoders, a quantum feedforward stack, and Fourier-based decoding. Parameters are trained with SPSA to avoid backpropagation through non-analytic components.

Result: The model achieves competitive performance (minADE of 1.94 m, minFDE of 3.56 m) on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, consistently outperforming kinematic baselines with better recall and reduced miss rates.

Conclusion: Residual learning in the lane frame, spectral ranking, and shallow entangled circuits focus computational resources effectively, enabling stable optimization and reliable predictions with compact quantum circuits.

Abstract: Trajectory forecasting for autonomous driving must deliver accurate, calibrated multi-modal futures under tight compute and latency constraints. We propose a compact hybrid quantum architecture that aligns quantum inductive bias with road-scene structure by operating in an ego-centric, lane-aligned frame and predicting residual corrections to a kinematic baseline instead of absolute poses. The model combines a transformer-inspired quantum attention encoder (9 qubits), a parameter-lean quantum feedforward stack (64 layers, ${\sim}1200$ trainable angles), and a Fourier-based decoder that uses shallow entanglement and phase superposition to generate 16 trajectory hypotheses in a single pass, with mode confidences derived from the latent spectrum. All circuit parameters are trained with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), avoiding backpropagation through non-analytic components. In the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the model achieves minADE (minimum Average Displacement Error) of \SI{1.94}{m} and minFDE (minimum Final Displacement Error) of \SI{3.56}{m} in the $16$ models predicted over the horizon of \SI{2.0}{s}, consistently outperforming a kinematic baseline with reduced miss rates and strong recall. Ablations confirm that residual learning in the lane frame, truncated Fourier decoding, shallow entanglement, and spectrum-based ranking focus capacity where it matters, yielding stable optimization and reliable multi-modal forecasts from small, shallow quantum circuits on a modern autonomous-driving benchmark.

*Quan Liu,Feng Ye,Chenhao Lu,Shuming Zhen,Guanliang Huang,Lunzhe Chen,Xudong Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial input transformation is improved using Block Stretch and Shrink (BSS) method, enhancing cross-model attack transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the transferability of adversarial attacks from white-box to black-box models by addressing the limitations of current input transformation-based attacks.

Method: The proposed Block Stretch and Shrink (BSS) method divides an image into blocks and performs stretch and shrink operations to diversify attention heatmaps while preserving global semantics.

Result: Empirical evaluations on ImageNet show BSS achieves superior transferability of adversarial examples compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: BSS enhances adversarial transferability through diversified attention heatmaps without compromising global input semantics. Unified evaluation standards are recommended for fair comparisons.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks introduce small, deliberately crafted perturbations that mislead neural networks, and their transferability from white-box to black-box target models remains a critical research focus. Input transformation-based attacks are a subfield of adversarial attacks that enhance input diversity through input transformations to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, existing input transformation-based attacks tend to exhibit limited cross-model transferability. Previous studies have shown that high transferability is associated with diverse attention heatmaps and the preservation of global semantics in transformed inputs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Block Stretch and Shrink (BSS), a method that divides an image into blocks and applies stretch and shrink operations to these blocks, thereby diversifying attention heatmaps in transformed inputs while maintaining their global semantics. Empirical evaluations on a subset of ImageNet demonstrate that BSS outperforms existing input transformation-based attack methods in terms of transferability. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the number scale, defined as the number of transformed inputs, in input transformation-based attacks, and advocate evaluating these methods under a unified number scale to enable fair and comparable assessments.

### [545] [Bayesian-based Online Label Shift Estimation with Dynamic Dirichlet Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18615)
*Jiawei Hu,Javier A. Barria*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses label shift in supervised learning with a Bayesian framework, introducing FMAPLS and online-FMAPLS methods that outperform current approaches in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label shift degrades classifier performance under a mismatch between training and test data class distributions.

Method: A Bayesian framework employs batch and online EM algorithms with a surrogate function for computational efficiency to dynamically optimize class priors and hyperparameters.

Result: FMAPLS and online-FMAPLS deliver up to 40% and 12% lower KL divergence, respectively, and enhance classification accuracy under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: These methods offer robust, scalable solutions suitable for large-scale and dynamic data environments, improving performance even in severe class imbalance scenarios.

Abstract: Label shift, a prevalent challenge in supervised learning, arises when the class prior distribution of test data differs from that of training data, leading to significant degradation in classifier performance. To accurately estimate the test priors and enhance classification accuracy, we propose a Bayesian framework for label shift estimation, termed Full Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (FMAPLS), along with its online version, online-FMAPLS. Leveraging batch and online Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, these methods jointly and dynamically optimize Dirichlet hyperparameters $\boldsymbolα$ and class priors $\boldsymbolπ$, thereby overcoming the rigid constraints of the existing Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (MAPLS) approach. Moreover, we introduce a linear surrogate function (LSF) to replace gradient-based hyperparameter updates, yielding closed-form solutions that reduce computational complexity while retaining asymptotic equivalence. The online variant substitutes the batch E-step with a stochastic approximation, enabling real-time adaptation to streaming data. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between online convergence rate and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets under shuffled long-tail and Dirichlet test priors demonstrate that FMAPLS and online-FMAPLS respectively achieve up to 40% and 12% lower KL divergence and substantial improvements in post-shift accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance and distributional uncertainty. These results confirm the robustness, scalability, and suitability of the proposed methods for large-scale and dynamic learning scenarios.

*Ginés Carreto Picón,Peng Yuan Zhou,Qi Zhang,Alexandros Iosifidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Continual Transformer (DeepCoT), a redundancy-free model for efficient stream data inference with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for efficient, low-latency inference on resource-constrained devices, especially for streaming data, motivates the need to reduce redundant computations while retaining high model performance.

Method: DeepCoT is a redundancy-free, encoder-only model applicable to existing deep encoder architectures with minimal changes, offering linear computational costs across Transformer layers.

Result: Experiments on audio, video, and text streams demonstrate that DeepCoT achieves performance comparable to baseline models while reducing computational costs significantly, improving running time by up to two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: DeepCoT effectively addresses computational redundancy in deep models for stream data inference, achieving efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have dramatically increased their size and parameter count to tackle increasingly complex tasks. At the same time, there is a growing demand for low-latency inference on resource-constrained devices that achieves high performance. In particular, stream data inference is typically performed over a sliding temporal window, leading to highly redundant computations. The recent Continual Transformers have addressed this issue, but they can only be effectively used in shallow models, which limits their scope and generalization power. In this paper, we propose the Deep Continual Transformer (DeepCoT), a redundancy-free encoder-only model that can be applied over existing deep encoder architectures with minimal changes. In our experiments over audio, video, and text streams, we show that DeepCoTs retain comparative performance to their non-continual baselines while offering a linear computational cost for all Transformer layers, which reduces up to two orders of magnitude in the running time compared to previous efficient models.

### [547] [Majority of the Bests: Improving Best-of-N via Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18630)
*Amin Rakhsha,Kanika Madan,Tianyu Zhang,Amir-massoud Farahmand,Amir Khasahmadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a new method for improving accuracy in selecting answers from Large Language Models (LLMs), outperforming the traditional Best-of-N (BoN) mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings of the Best-of-N (BoN) selection mechanism, particularly its degraded performance due to imperfect reward models, and to provide a more reliable way of selecting correct outputs from LLMs.

Method: The authors propose the Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB) method, which estimates the output distribution of BoN using bootstrapping and selects the mode of this distribution as the final answer.

Result: Experimental results across five benchmarks, three LLMs, and two reward models show MoB improves performance over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups. Additionally, theoretical consistency of the bootstrapping approach is demonstrated.

Conclusion: MoB is presented as a robust and effective alternative to BoN and self-consistency methods, encouraging further exploration of sophisticated selection mechanisms.

Abstract: Sampling multiple outputs from a Large Language Model (LLM) and selecting the most frequent (Self-consistency) or highest-scoring (Best-of-N) candidate is a popular approach to achieve higher accuracy in tasks with discrete final answers. Best-of-N (BoN) selects the output with the highest reward, and with perfect rewards, it often achieves near-perfect accuracy. With imperfect rewards from reward models, however, BoN fails to reliably find the correct answer and its performance degrades drastically. We consider the distribution of BoN's outputs and highlight that, although the correct answer does not usually have a probability close to one under imperfect rewards, it is often the most likely outcome. This suggests that the mode of this distribution can be more reliably correct than a sample from it. Based on this idea, we propose Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a novel selection mechanism that estimates the output distribution of BoN via bootstrapping and selects its mode. Experimental results across five benchmarks, three different base LLMs, and two reward models demonstrate consistent improvements over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups. We also provide theoretical results for the consistency of the bootstrapping. MoB serves as a simple, yet strong alternative to BoN and self-consistency, and more broadly, motivates further research in more nuanced selection mechanisms.

### [548] [Subtract the Corruption: Training-Data-Free Corrective Machine Unlearning using Task Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18660)
*Mostafa Mozafari,Farooq Ahmad Wani,Maria Sofia Bucarelli,Fabrizio Silvestri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Corrective Unlearning in Task Space (CUTS), a method for removing corruption in trained models without access to original training data. It uses a small proxy set of corrupted samples and outperforms existing methods in eliminating corruption while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of removing corruption from trained models in scenarios where the original training data and identified corrupted samples (forget set) are inaccessible, which is a common challenge in real-world applications.

Method: The proposed method, CUTS, uses task arithmetic principles. It fine-tunes a corrupted model on a proxy set to amplify the corruption signal, calculates a task vector based on weight differences, and subtracts a calibrated multiple of this vector to mitigate the corruption without needing the original data.

Result: CUTS showed significant recovery of lost utility due to label noise and was highly effective in removing backdoor triggers while minimizing damage to model utility, outperforming specialized methods for source-free corrective machine unlearning.

Conclusion: CUTS provides a practical and effective solution for source-free corrective machine unlearning, overcoming the limitations of previous methods by relying instead on a small proxy set to remove corruption and preserving the utility of the model.

Abstract: Corrupted training data are ubiquitous. Corrective Machine Unlearning (CMU) seeks to remove the influence of such corruption post-training. Prior CMU typically assumes access to identified corrupted training samples (a ``forget set''). However, in many real-world scenarios the training data are no longer accessible. We formalize \emph{source-free} CMU, where the original training data are unavailable and, consequently, no forget set of identified corrupted training samples can be specified. Instead, we assume a small proxy (surrogate) set of corrupted samples that reflect the suspected corruption type without needing to be the original training samples. In this stricter setting, methods relying on forget set are ineffective or narrow in scope. We introduce \textit{Corrective Unlearning in Task Space} (CUTS), a lightweight weight space correction method guided by the proxy set using task arithmetic principles. CUTS treats the clean and the corruption signal as distinct tasks. Specifically, we briefly fine-tune the corrupted model on the proxy to amplify the corruption mechanism in the weight space, compute the difference between the corrupted and fine-tuned weights as a proxy task vector, and subtract a calibrated multiple of this vector to cancel the corruption. Without access to clean data or a forget set, CUTS recovers a large fraction of the lost utility under label noise and, for backdoor triggers, nearly eliminates the attack with minimal damage to utility, outperforming state-of-the-art specialized CMU methods in source-free setting.

*Andrew Lee,Mahir Mobarrat,Xiaolin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel deep learning-based surrogate model with periodicity-enforced layers is proposed to design deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) devices for cancer detection more efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing microfluidic devices like DLD systems for cancer detection is computationally expensive due to the need for Navier-Stokes simulations and particle analyses. Deep learning methods provide faster alternatives but often fail to handle periodic boundary conditions accurately.

Method: The study introduces a surrogate modeling approach with periodicity-enforced layers in deep neural networks. These layers ensure the exact periodicity of flow fields without relying on penalty terms or output modifications. Three sub-networks predict steady-state velocity and pressure fields.

Result: The model achieves less than 0.478% critical diameter error with perfect periodicity consistency across boundaries, demonstrating an 85.4% improvement compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: This approach enables efficient and precise DLD device designs by overcoming limitations with periodic boundary conditions, promising improved performance in cancer detection applications.

Abstract: Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) devices enable liquid biopsy for cancer detection by separating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples based on size, but designing these microfluidic devices requires computationally expensive Navier-Stokes simulations and particle-tracing analyses. While recent surrogate modeling approaches using deep learning have accelerated this process, they often inadequately handle the critical periodic boundary conditions of DLD unit cells, leading to cumulative errors in multi-unit device predictions. This paper introduces a periodicity-enforced surrogate modeling approach that incorporates periodic layers, neural network components that guarantee exact periodicity without penalty terms or output modifications, into deep learning architectures for DLD device design. The proposed method employs three sub-networks to predict steady-state, non-dimensional velocity and pressure fields (u, v, p) rather than directly predicting critical diameters or particle trajectories, enabling complete flow field characterization and enhanced design flexibility. Periodic layers ensure exact matching of flow variables across unit cell boundaries through architectural enforcement rather than soft penalty-based approaches. Validation on 120 CFD-generated geometries demonstrates that the periodic layer implementation achieves 0.478% critical diameter error while maintaining perfect periodicity consistency, representing an 85.4% improvement over baseline methods. The approach enables efficient and accurate DLD device design with guaranteed boundary condition satisfaction for multi-unit device applications.

Conclusion: OceanForecastBench delivers an open-source, state-of-the-art framework to standardize and advance data-driven ocean forecasting research, promoting collaboration and innovation in the field.

Abstract: Global ocean forecasting aims to predict key ocean variables such as temperature, salinity, and currents, which is essential for understanding and describing oceanic phenomena. In recent years, data-driven deep learning-based ocean forecast models, such as XiHe, WenHai, LangYa and AI-GOMS, have demonstrated significant potential in capturing complex ocean dynamics and improving forecasting efficiency. Despite these advancements, the absence of open-source, standardized benchmarks has led to inconsistent data usage and evaluation methods. This gap hinders efficient model development, impedes fair performance comparison, and constrains interdisciplinary collaboration. To address this challenge, we propose OceanForecastBench, a benchmark offering three core contributions: (1) A high-quality global ocean reanalysis data over 28 years for model training, including 4 ocean variables across 23 depth levels and 4 sea surface variables. (2) A high-reliability satellite and in-situ observations for model evaluation, covering approximately 100 million locations in the global ocean. (3) An evaluation pipeline and a comprehensive benchmark with 6 typical baseline models, leveraging observations to evaluate model performance from multiple perspectives. OceanForecastBench represents the most comprehensive benchmarking framework currently available for data-driven ocean forecasting, offering an open-source platform for model development, evaluation, and comparison.

*Senmao Tian,Xiang Wei,Shunli Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SC-SSL, a method to address biased classification in semi-supervised learning caused by class imbalance and distribution mismatches between labeled and unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance and distribution mismatches in semi-supervised learning lead to biased classification that existing methods address inadequately by conflating data imbalance with class learning difficulties.

Method: The proposed SC-SSL framework uses decoupled sampling control during training, classifier expansion, adaptive sampling probabilities, and post-hoc adjustments during inference to mitigate class-level and feature-level imbalances.

Result: Experiments across benchmarks confirm that SC-SSL offers consistent and state-of-the-art performance in handling class imbalance and distribution mismatches.

Conclusion: SC-SSL effectively suppresses model bias, improving semi-supervised learning reliability under class imbalance conditions with extensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in semi-supervised learning (SSL), especially when distributional mismatches between labeled and unlabeled data lead to biased classification. Although existing methods address this issue by adjusting logits based on the estimated class distribution of unlabeled data, they often handle model imbalance in a coarse-grained manner, conflating data imbalance with bias arising from varying class-specific learning difficulties. To address this issue, we propose a unified framework, SC-SSL, which suppresses model bias through decoupled sampling control. During training, we identify the key variables for sampling control under ideal conditions. By introducing a classifier with explicit expansion capability and adaptively adjusting sampling probabilities across different data distributions, SC-SSL mitigates feature-level imbalance for minority classes. In the inference phase, we further analyze the weight imbalance of the linear classifier and apply post-hoc sampling control with an optimization bias vector to directly calibrate the logits. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets and distribution settings validate the consistency and state-of-the-art performance of SC-SSL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for calculating the excess risk of ERM using a novel refitting procedure with pseudo-outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of evaluating excess risk in modern, opaque machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, due to their extreme hypothesis class complexity.

Method: The authors propose generating two pseudo-labeled datasets with stochastically perturbed gradients, refitting the black-box algorithm twice, and deriving an efficient excess risk bound using the original and 'wild' predictors.

Result: The proposed method efficiently computes high-probability upper bounds for excess risk in a fixed-design setting without requiring knowledge of the function class complexity.

Conclusion: This model-free approach provides a robust framework for evaluating excess risk in complex, opaque machine learning systems where traditional methods fail.

Abstract: We study the problem of excess risk evaluation for empirical risk minimization (ERM) under general convex loss functions. Our contribution is an efficient refitting procedure that computes the excess risk and provides high-probability upper bounds under the fixed-design setting. Assuming only black-box access to the training algorithm and a single dataset, we begin by generating two sets of artificially modified pseudo-outcomes termed wild response, created by stochastically perturbing the gradient vectors with carefully chosen scaling. Using these two pseudo-labeled datasets, we then refit the black-box procedure twice to obtain two corresponding wild predictors. Finally, leveraging the original predictor, the two wild predictors, and the constructed wild responses, we derive an efficient excess risk upper bound. A key feature of our analysis is that it requires no prior knowledge of the complexity of the underlying function class. As a result, the method is essentially model-free and holds significant promise for theoretically evaluating modern opaque machine learning system--such as deep nerral networks and generative model--where traditional capacity-based learning theory becomes infeasible due to the extreme complexity of the hypothesis class.

Motivation: Digital computers, while powerful, face challenges in energy efficiency and durability in uncertain conditions. CLLNs offer an alternative for low-power, damage-resistant systems.

Method: The study adapts Q-learning for simulated CLLNs, highlighting their suitability for certain RL tools like policy and value functions while addressing limitations like replay buffers.

Result: CLLNs successfully solve simple RL problems in simulation, affirming their applicability and highlighting secondary biological-inspired goals.

Conclusion: CLLNs demonstrate potential for autonomous, energy-efficient learning systems, challenging assumptions inherent in digital systems and reflecting biology-related learning priorities.

Abstract: Digital computers are power-hungry and largely intolerant of damaged components, making them potentially difficult tools for energy-limited autonomous agents in uncertain environments. Recently developed Contrastive Local Learning Networks (CLLNs) - analog networks of self-adjusting nonlinear resistors - are inherently low-power and robust to physical damage, but were constructed to perform supervised learning. In this work we demonstrate success on two simple RL problems using Q-learning adapted for simulated CLLNs. Doing so makes explicit the components (beyond the network being trained) required to enact various tools in the RL toolbox, some of which (policy function and value function) are more natural in this system than others (replay buffer). We discuss assumptions such as the physical safety that digital hardware requires, CLLNs can forgo, and biological systems cannot rely on, and highlight secondary goals that are important in biology and trainable in CLLNs, but make little sense in digital computers.

Result: The proposed framework achieves 3-4% improvement in cross-subject accuracy over existing methods on the BCI-IV 2a benchmark.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware transformations enhance robustness in cross-subject EEG decoding, demonstrating a viable method for zero-shot cross-subject motor-imagery decoding.

Abstract: Cross-subject motor-imagery decoding remains a major challenge in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces due to strong subject variability and the curved geometry of covariance matrices on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold. We address the zero-shot cross-subject setting, where no target-subject labels or adaptation are allowed, by introducing novel geometry-aware preprocessing modules and deep congruence networks that operate directly on SPD covariance matrices. Our preprocessing modules, DCR and RiFU, extend Riemannian Alignment by improving action separation while reducing subject-specific distortions. We further propose two manifold classifiers, SPD-DCNet and RiFUNet, which use hierarchical congruence transforms to learn discriminative, subject-invariant covariance representations. On the BCI-IV 2a benchmark, our framework improves cross-subject accuracy by 3-4% over the strongest classical baselines, demonstrating the value of geometry-aware transformations for robust EEG decoding.

*Robert Bredereck,Eva Deltl,Leon Kellerhals,Jannik Peters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals that stable clustering solutions may not exist in specific non-centroid clustering scenarios, presenting tight bounds on stability for a given clustering objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the stability of clustering solutions under the max-loss objective, focusing on whether stable solutions (α-core clusters) exist for certain configurations.

Method: The authors analytically construct metric instances to test core stability and employ computer-aided proofs to validate their findings, comparing general cases and specific Euclidean scenarios.

Result: It is proven that certain clustering scenarios (where the max loss is used and with specific configurations) cannot achieve a stable core unless $α$ is above a computed threshold, which is approximately 1.148.

Conclusion: The study establishes the first result demonstrating the impossibility of consistent stability in non-centroid clustering under the max-loss objective and tight bounds are identified for such scenarios.

Abstract: We study core stability in non-centroid clustering under the max-loss objective, where each agent's loss is the maximum distance to other members of their cluster. We prove that for all $k\geq 3$ there exist metric instances with $n\ge 9$ agents, with $n$ divisible by $k$, for which no clustering lies in the $α$-core for any $α<2^{\frac{1}{5}}\sim 1.148$. The bound is tight for our construction. Using a computer-aided proof, we also identify a two-dimensional Euclidean point set whose associated lower bound is slightly smaller than that of our general construction. This is, to our knowledge, the first impossibility result showing that the core can be empty in non-centroid clustering under the max-loss objective.

*Cuong Pham,Hoang Anh Dung,Cuong C. Nguyen,Trung Le,Gustavo Carneiro,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new quadratic optimization framework to optimize layer-specific quantization for large language models (LLMs), addressing accuracy losses at extremely low bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive parameter counts in LLMs create computational and memory challenges, necessitating more efficient deployment methods like quantization.

Method: The framework strategically assigns different quantization bit-widths for parameters based on layer sensitivity and inter-layer dependencies.

Result: The approach preserves more high-impact parameters under resource constraints while maintaining high model accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method balances computational efficiency and accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art quantization approaches for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, but their massive parameter counts create substantial computational and memory challenges during deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges with minimal overhead. While existing PTQ methods can effectively quantize LLMs, they experience substantial accuracy loss at extremely low bit-widths, primarily due to high-impact parameters that significantly influence quantization performance. Several approaches address these issues by identifying and retaining the high-impact parameters in FP16 format. However, they apply fixed ratios of high-impact parameters across all layers, overlooking layer-wise sensitivity variations. In this paper, we propose a quadratic optimization framework that determines layer-specific ratios of high-impact parameters while considering inter-layer dependencies. We quantize high-impact parameters to moderate bit-widths, which often result in negligible performance degradation in quantized LLMs, while the remaining parameters can be quantized to extremely low bit-widths. Under the same resource-constrained budget, this allows for preserving more high-impact parameters than methods that keep selecting a few in FP16 format. Additionally, the proposed framework allows us to leverage an advanced quantization method that often requires extensive learnable parameters solely for high-impact parameters, while applying a computationally efficient method to the rest. Our approach achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy while maintaining high performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Cuong Pham,Hoang Anh Dung,Cuong C. Nguyen,Trung Le,Gustavo Carneiro,Jianfei Cai,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for optimizing quantization in large language models (LLMs) through adaptive, layer-wise transformations, addressing challenges caused by outliers that degrade performance during deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large language models (LLMs) requires significant computational resources, and quantization is vital to make this feasible. However, systematic outliers in activations and weights pose a challenge, causing substantial performance degradation, particularly at low-bit quantization settings.

Method: The proposed method introduces an adaptive transformation selection framework to determine the optimal transformations for each layer in a model. This involves the use of differentiable optimization and an outlier-guided layer selection strategy based on robust z-score normalization to reduce computational overhead.

Result: Experiments on the LLaMA model family indicate that the adaptive approach achieves improved model performance compared to fixed transformation methods, showing up to a 4.58 perplexity improvement and a 2.11% accuracy gain in specific quantization settings.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of heterogeneous layer-wise transformation selection for effective LLM quantization, achieving superior performance with reduced computational overhead compared to existing fixed transformation-based methods.

Abstract: Large language models require significant computational resources for deployment, making quantization essential for practical applications. However, the main obstacle to effective quantization lies in systematic outliers in activations and weights, which cause substantial LLM performance degradation, especially at low-bit settings. While existing transformation-based methods like affine and rotation transformations successfully mitigate outliers, they apply the homogeneous transformation setting, i.e., using the same transformation types across all layers, ignoring the heterogeneous distribution characteristics within LLMs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive transformation selection framework that systematically determines optimal transformations on a per-layer basis. To this end, we first formulate transformation selection as a differentiable optimization problem to achieve the accurate transformation type for each layer. However, searching for optimal layer-wise transformations for every model is computationally expensive. To this end, we establish the connection between weight distribution kurtosis and accurate transformation type. Specifically, we propose an outlier-guided layer selection method using robust $z$-score normalization that achieves comparable performance to differentiable search with significantly reduced overhead. Comprehensive experiments on LLaMA family models demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently outperforms the widely-used fixed transformation settings. For example, our method achieves an improvement of up to 4.58 perplexity points and a 2.11% gain in average six-task zero-shot accuracy under aggressive W3A3K2V2 quantization settings for the LLaMA-3-8B model compared to the current best existing method, FlatQuant, demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous transformation selection for optimal LLM quantization.

*Prateek Garg,Bhavya Kohli,Sunita Sarawagi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) for generative modeling, focusing on optimizing decoding order, which is influenced by multivariate noise schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to explore whether a training framework for Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) can optimize decoding order to improve generative modeling performance.

Method: The method involves equipping the continuous-time variational objective of MDMs with multivariate noise schedules, enabling optimization of decoding orders during training.

Result: The paper demonstrates a direct link between decoding order and multivariate noise schedules, breaking the invariance of MDM objectives to noise schedules and decomposing the objective into weighted auto-regressive losses.

Conclusion: The findings establish Masked Diffusion Models as auto-regressive models with the ability to learn decoding orders, improving their training and performance.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as one of the most promising paradigms for generative modeling over discrete domains. It is known that MDMs effectively train to decode tokens in a random order, and that this ordering has significant performance implications in practice. This observation raises a fundamental question: can we design a training framework that optimizes for a favorable decoding order? We answer this in the affirmative, showing that the continuous-time variational objective of MDMs, when equipped with multivariate noise schedules, can identify and optimize for a decoding order during training. We establish a direct correspondence between decoding order and the multivariate noise schedule and show that this setting breaks invariance of the MDM objective to the noise schedule. Furthermore, we prove that the MDM objective decomposes precisely into a weighted auto-regressive losses over these orders, which establishes them as auto-regressive models with learnable orders.

*Aishwarya Mandyam,Kalyani Limaye,Barbara E. Engelhardt,Emily Alsentzer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) for generating counterfactual annotations to improve off-policy evaluation (OPE) in healthcare, demonstrating improved estimation and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is crucial for safety in critical fields like healthcare but is limited by the size and comprehensiveness of behavioral datasets. Acquiring expert-labeled counterfactual data is costly and unsustainable, calling for scalable alternatives.

Method: The paper utilizes domain-guided LLMs to predict the evolution of clinical features under alternate treatments, converting them into counterfactual annotations via known reward functions. These annotations are then integrated into an OPE estimator to evaluate their performance.

Result: Experiments on patient data from MIMIC-IV reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs predict clinical features effectively. Incorporating LLM-based counterfactual annotations improves OPE estimates under many conditions, and an entropy-based metric identifies diminishing benefits of additional annotations.

Conclusion: LLM-based counterfactual annotations provide a scalable and effective way to overcome healthcare dataset limitations, enhancing the safety and efficiency of decision-making policies in clinical environments.

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) estimates the value of a contextual bandit policy prior to deployment. As such, OPE plays a critical role in ensuring safety in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, standard OPE approaches are limited by the size and coverage of the behavior dataset. While previous work has explored using expert-labeled counterfactual annotations to enhance dataset coverage, obtaining such annotations is expensive, limiting the scalability of prior approaches. We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual annotations for OPE in medical domains. Our method uses domain knowledge to guide LLMs in predicting how key clinical features evolve under alternate treatments. These predicted features can then be transformed using known reward functions to create counterfactual annotations. We first evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict clinical features across two patient subsets in MIMIC-IV, finding that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve comparable performance. Building on this capacity to predict clinical features, we generate LLM-based counterfactual annotations and incorporate them into an OPE estimator. Our empirical results analyze the benefits of counterfactual annotations under varying degrees of shift between the behavior and target policies. We find that in most cases, the LLM-based counterfactual annotations significantly improve OPE estimates up to a point. We provide an entropy-based metric to identify when additional annotations cease to be useful. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based counterfactual annotations offer a scalable approach for addressing coverage limitations in healthcare datasets, enabling safer deployment of decision-making policies in clinical settings.

*David Stenger,Armin Lindicke,Alexander von Rohr,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Local Entropy Search (LES), a Bayesian optimization approach focused on refining local designs via descent sequences with superior sample efficiency compared to other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global optimization in large and complex design spaces is often infeasible, prompting the need for a practical way to refine designs locally using iterative optimization.

Method: LES uses Bayesian optimization to propagate posterior beliefs over objectives through iterative optimizers, selects evaluations maximizing mutual information using analytic entropy and Monte-Carlo sampling of descent sequences.

Result: Empirical studies demonstrate that LES performs well on synthetic objectives and benchmark problems, offering high sample efficiency compared to existing optimization approaches.

Conclusion: LES provides an efficient and targeted method for local optimization by leveraging Bayesian principles and descent sequences.

Abstract: Searching large and complex design spaces for a global optimum can be infeasible and unnecessary. A practical alternative is to iteratively refine the neighborhood of an initial design using local optimization methods such as gradient descent. We propose local entropy search (LES), a Bayesian optimization paradigm that explicitly targets the solutions reachable by the descent sequences of iterative optimizers. The algorithm propagates the posterior belief over the objective through the optimizer, resulting in a probability distribution over descent sequences. It then selects the next evaluation by maximizing mutual information with that distribution, using a combination of analytic entropy calculations and Monte-Carlo sampling of descent sequences. Empirical results on high-complexity synthetic objectives and benchmark problems show that LES achieves strong sample efficiency compared to existing local and global Bayesian optimization methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a methodology for improving probabilistic prediction in partially observable dynamical systems using a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored for capturing long-range temporal dependencies efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve probabilistic predictions for dynamical systems that are only partially observable and involve long-memory, such as solar dynamics, where traditional methods struggle with capturing long-range dependencies.

Method: The paper introduces a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, designed to produce temporally fine-grained trajectories close to the present and coarser ones further in the future, allowing integration of past information effectively.

Result: The proposed method reduces the bias in predicted distributions, captures long-range dependencies better, and improves rollout stability compared to standard inference schemes.

Conclusion: The method enhances the predictive performance of diffusion models for partially observable, long-memory systems, particularly in challenging applications like solar physics and dynamical systems with limited observations.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents MOELO, a machine learning framework for adaptive indoor localization that addresses domain and class shifts effectively, enhancing reliability in real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of domain shifts and class shifts caused by hardware/software variations and evolving indoor environments, which render static models ineffective over time.

Method: MOELO employs a mixture-of-experts architecture that incrementally trains expert models per region, using an equiangular tight frame-based gating mechanism for efficient routing and low-latency inference within a compact model footprint.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate MOELO's significant improvements, including up to 25.6x better mean localization error, 44.5x better worst-case localization error, and 21.5x lesser forgetting compared to existing frameworks.

Conclusion: MOELO offers a robust, adaptive, and lightweight framework for addressing domain-incremental and class-incremental learning scenarios, proving effective for indoor localization on resource-limited mobile devices in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Indoor localization using machine learning has gained traction due to the growing demand for location-based services. However, its long-term reliability is hindered by hardware/software variations across mobile devices, which shift the model's input distribution to create domain shifts. Further, evolving indoor environments can introduce new locations over time, expanding the output space to create class shifts, making static machine learning models ineffective over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unified continual learning framework for indoor localization called MOELO that, for the first time, jointly addresses domain-incremental and class-incremental learning scenarios. MOELO enables a lightweight, robust, and adaptive localization solution that can be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices and is capable of continual learning in dynamic, heterogeneous real-world settings. This is made possible by a mixture-of-experts architecture, where experts are incrementally trained per region and selected through an equiangular tight frame based gating mechanism ensuring efficient routing, and low-latency inference, all within a compact model footprint. Experimental evaluations show that MOELO achieves improvements of up to 25.6x in mean localization error, 44.5x in worst-case localization error, and 21.5x lesser forgetting compared to state-of-the-art frameworks across diverse buildings, mobile devices, and learning scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graded framework for symbolic computation in transformers, combining geometry and self-supervised learning for interpretable and sparse behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve internal symbolic computations in transformers by utilizing graded structures that allow interpretable and sparse behavior.

Method: The proposed method involves graded hidden spaces, typed block morphisms (selectively activated via a differentiable routing policy), and a graded utility functional for self-supervised optimization.

Result: Analytical studies demonstrate selective morphic activation and its utility in hybrid symbolic-linguistic tasks. The framework subsumes prior approaches like Toolformer as a special case.

Conclusion: The approach unifies symbolic computation, geometry, and self-supervised learning, offering a generalized framework for transformers' internal operations and improving interpretability and utility.

Abstract: We introduce a graded formulation of internal symbolic computation for transformers. The hidden space is endowed with a grading $V=\bigoplus_{g\in G}V_g$, and symbolic operations are realized as typed block maps (morphisms) $φ_{h\leftarrow g}:V_g\to V_h$ that are activated selectively by a differentiable routing policy. A self-supervised \emph{graded utility functional}, defined as the loss reduction induced by a candidate morphism, governs activation and yields sparse, interpretable behavior. We develop the algebraic and geometric foundations: an internal model category whose objects are homogeneous components and whose morphisms are admissible grade transitions; adjoint pairs encoding typed round trips; and information-geometric interpretations in terms of KL gain, mirror descent with Bregman divergences, and Fisher natural gradients. Methodologically, we specify a utility--aware routing mechanism and objective that remain fully end-to-end differentiable. Analytic case studies and lightweight sanity checks illustrate selective morphic activation on hybrid symbolic-linguistic tasks. The framework unifies symbolic computation, geometry, and self--supervised learning within the \emph{graded transformer} formalism \cite{sh-89,sh-95}, while subsuming prior external-tool paradigms (e.g., Toolformer \cite{toolformer2023}) as a special case via functorial internalization.

TL;DR: The paper combines CNN-based bijective autoencoders with GNNs for scalable simulations of grain growth, reducing computational costs and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiencies and scalability issues of GNNs in realistic grain boundary network modeling.

Method: A hybrid architecture utilizing a CNN-based bijective autoencoder for spatial dimension compression and GNN for latent space evolution.

Result: For a 160^3 mesh, it reduced memory usage and runtime by 117x and 115x respectively, while improving accuracy and spatiotemporal modeling over GNN alone.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable and accurate approach for simulating microstructures, leveraging compressed, expressive latent features for extended time-scale modeling.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a promising machine learning method for microstructure simulations such as grain growth. However, accurate modeling of realistic grain boundary networks requires large simulation cells, which GNN has difficulty scaling up to. To alleviate the computational costs and memory footprint of GNN, we propose a hybrid architecture combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) based bijective autoencoder to compress the spatial dimensions, and a GNN that evolves the microstructure in the latent space of reduced spatial sizes. Our results demonstrate that the new design significantly reduces computational costs with using fewer message passing layer (from 12 down to 3) compared with GNN alone. The reduction in computational cost becomes more pronounced as the spatial size increases, indicating strong computational scalability. For the largest mesh evaluated (160^3), our method reduces memory usage and runtime in inference by 117x and 115x, respectively, compared with GNN-only baseline. More importantly, it shows higher accuracy and stronger spatiotemporal capability than the GNN-only baseline, especially in long-term testing. Such combination of scalability and accuracy is essential for simulating realistic material microstructures over extended time scales. The improvements can be attributed to the bijective autoencoder's ability to compress information losslessly from spatial domain into a high dimensional feature space, thereby producing more expressive latent features for the GNN to learn from, while also contributing its own spatiotemporal modeling capability. The training was optimized to learn from the stochastic Potts Monte Carlo method. Our findings provide a highly scalable approach for simulating grain growth.

TL;DR: This study generalizes the concept that context effects in transformers can be represented as rank-1 patches to their weights, extending this theory to diverse modern Large Language Model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a deeper understanding of how transformers leverage context through implicit weight adjustments and apply this theory to various modern LLM architectures.

Method: Analytical proofs and constructive algorithms that establish the effects of context on modular architectures using two principles: input controllability and output controllability.

Result: Constructive framework and proofs demonstrating that implicit weight patches can be perfectly applied in diverse architectures, including advanced features like gating and mixture-of-experts.

Conclusion: The study unifies and extends foundational theories to modern architectures, enabling a simpler and generalizable understanding of context-to-weight transformations in transformers.

Abstract: Recent research has established that the impact of context in a vanilla transformer can be represented implicitly by forming a token-dependent, rank-1 patch to its MLP weights. This work extends that foundational theory to the diverse architectures of modern Large Language Models. We first demonstrate a precise, analytical solution for a Gemma-style transformer block, proving that the entire effect of a context can be perfectly mapped to rank-1 patches on its MLP weight matrices and a patch to the RMSNorm scale. We then generalize this result, providing a constructive proof and algorithm for multi-layer models. To unify these findings, we introduce a general framework centered on two core properties: input controllability and output controllability. We prove that a perfect implicit weight patch is possible for any MLP block where the inner function is input-controllable and the outer function is output-controllable. This provides a simpler and more powerful lens for understanding how transformer models transmute prompts into effective weights. This setup generalizes to a wide range of modern LLM architectures including gating, pre-/post-norm, mixture of experts and sequential/parallel transformer blocks.

*Yusong Wu,Stephen Brade,Teng Ma,Tia-Jane Fowler,Enning Yang,Berker Banar,Aaron Courville,Natasha Jaques,Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adversarial training method to combat reward hacking in reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for collaborative, real-time generative tasks like musical live jamming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most generative AI systems focus on non-real-time interactions where diversity and adaptation are not critical. However, live jamming requires real-time coordination, adaptation, and maintaining creativity. RL post-training often suffers from reward hacking, which collapses output diversity—an issue particularly harmful for creative applications like live music performance.

Method: The method incorporates adversarial training during RL post-training. A co-evolving discriminator distinguishes generated sequences from true data distributions, while the policy optimizes both discriminator feedback and coherence rewards, preventing reward collapse and preserving diversity.

Result: Simulation and user studies show that the proposed method improves output diversity, harmonic coherence, adaptation speed, and user experience in real-time collaborative music systems.

Conclusion: The adversarial training approach effectively mitigates reward hacking, enhancing diversity and adaptation in RL-based generative systems, with promising implications for creative and interactive applications.

Abstract: Most applications of generative AI involve a sequential interaction in which a person inputs a prompt and waits for a response, and where reaction time and adaptivity are not important factors. In contrast, live jamming is a collaborative interaction that requires real-time coordination and adaptation without access to the other player's future moves, while preserving diversity to sustain a creative flow. Reinforcement learning post-training enables effective adaptation through on-policy interaction, yet it often reduces output diversity by exploiting coherence-based rewards. This collapse, known as ``reward hacking'', affects many RL post-training pipelines, but is especially harmful in live jamming, where musical creativity relies on dynamic variation and mutual responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training method on policy-generated trajectories to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for melody-to-chord accompaniment. A co-evolving discriminator separates policy trajectories from the data distribution, while the policy maximizes the discriminator output in addition to coherence rewards to prevent collapse to trivial outputs. We evaluate accompaniment quality and output diversity in simulation with both fixed test melodies and learned melody agents, and we conduct a user study with the model deployed in a real-time interactive system with expert musicians. Quantitative evaluation and user feedback demonstrate improved output diversity, harmonic coherence, adaptation speed and user agency. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective method to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training of generative sequence models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in implementing numerically robust 3D rigid-body transforms, which are crucial for robotics, vision, and simulations but prone to errors in edge cases.

Method: The authors revised SciPy's spatial.transform module to make it compatible with the Python array API. This enables integration with GPU/TPU workflows and various array libraries while maintaining SciPy's established interface.

Result: The updated module now supports GPU/TPU execution, JIT compilation, vectorized batching, and native autodiff. It enables applications such as large-scale 3D transformations and accurate rotational dynamics in drone simulations.

Conclusion: The upgraded SciPy module provides a versatile, framework-agnostic foundation for 3D spatial math, enhancing differentiable scientific computing and machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: Three-dimensional rigid-body transforms, i.e. rotations and translations, are central to modern differentiable machine learning pipelines in robotics, vision, and simulation. However, numerically robust and mathematically correct implementations, particularly on SO(3), are error-prone due to issues such as axis conventions, normalizations, composition consistency and subtle errors that only appear in edge cases. SciPy's spatial.transform module is a rigorously tested Python implementation. However, it historically only supported NumPy, limiting adoption in GPU-accelerated and autodiff-based workflows. We present a complete overhaul of SciPy's spatial.transform functionality that makes it compatible with any array library implementing the Python array API, including JAX, PyTorch, and CuPy. The revised implementation preserves the established SciPy interface while enabling GPU/TPU execution, JIT compilation, vectorized batching, and differentiation via native autodiff of the chosen backend. We demonstrate how this foundation supports differentiable scientific computing through two case studies: (i) scalability of 3D transforms and rotations and (ii) a JAX drone simulation that leverages SciPy's Rotation for accurate integration of rotational dynamics. Our contributions have been merged into SciPy main and will ship in the next release, providing a framework-agnostic, production-grade basis for 3D spatial math in differentiable systems and ML.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Category-Equivariant Neural Networks (CENNs), generalizing equivariant architectures across various mathematical structures and proving their universal approximation capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify various equivariant neural networks (such as group/groupoid, poset/lattice, graph, and sheaf-based networks) under a common theoretical framework and expand the scope of equivariant deep learning.

Method: Using categorical theory with topological categories and Radon measures to establish a systematic formulation of equivariance and prove universal approximation for continuous equivariant transformations.

Result: The authors provide universal approximation theorems for multiple equivariant frameworks (e.g., groups, graphs, lattices, etc.) stemming from their work on CENNs.

Conclusion: This theory establishes a unified and generalized framework for equivariant deep learning, broadening its applicability beyond traditional geometric symmetries to encompass contextual and compositional ones.

Abstract: We develop a theory of category-equivariant neural networks (CENNs) that unifies group/groupoid-equivariant networks, poset/lattice-equivariant networks, graph and sheaf neural networks. Equivariance is formulated as naturality in a topological category with Radon measures, formulating linear and nonlinear layers in the categorical setup. We prove the equivariant universal approximation theorem in the general setting: the class of finite-depth CENNs is dense in the space of continuous equivariant transformations. We instantiate the framework for groups/groupoids, posets/lattices, graphs and cellular sheaves, deriving universal approximation theorems for them in a systematic manner. Categorical equivariant deep learning thus allows us to expand the horizons of equivariant deep learning beyond group actions, encompassing not only geometric symmetries but also contextual and compositional symmetries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid model combining LSTM and PPO for dynamic portfolio optimization, achieving better returns and resilience in diverse market conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance portfolio optimization under dynamic and non-stationary market conditions by leveraging AI models capable of both forecasting and adaptive allocation.

Method: The system combines LSTM for forecasting temporal dependencies with PPO reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust portfolio allocations. Evaluations are conducted using diverse asset datasets and benchmarking against several baselines with metrics such as Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown.

Result: The hybrid framework outperforms equal-weight, index-based, and single-model approaches under metrics like annualized return, volatility, and adjusted Sharpe ratio.

Conclusion: The hybrid LSTM-PPO approach proves effective in adapting to market shifts and delivering superior results, laying a foundation for robust AI-driven portfolio optimization frameworks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid framework for portfolio optimization that fuses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning strategy. The proposed system leverages the predictive power of deep recurrent networks to capture temporal dependencies, while the PPO agent adaptively refines portfolio allocations in continuous action spaces, allowing the system to anticipate trends while adjusting dynamically to market shifts. Using multi-asset datasets covering U.S. and Indonesian equities, U.S. Treasuries, and major cryptocurrencies from January 2018 to December 2024, the model is evaluated against several baselines, including equal-weight, index-style, and single-model variants (LSTM-only and PPO-only). The framework's performance is benchmarked against equal-weighted, index-based, and single-model approaches (LSTM-only and PPO-only) using annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown metrics, each adjusted for transaction costs. The results indicate that the hybrid architecture delivers higher returns and stronger resilience under non-stationary market regimes, suggesting its promise as a robust, AI-driven framework for dynamic portfolio optimization.

*Oluleke Babayomi,Dong-Seong Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cyber-resilient system for microgrid energy management combining advanced attack detection and decentralized optimization to minimize economic losses and preserve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining reliability and efficiency in microgrid energy management amidst cyberattacks, while traditional methods overlook attack scenarios and uncertainty quantification.

Method: The paper proposes a federated LSTM-based photovoltaic forecasting integrated with a novel two-stage cascade false data injection attack detection system. This includes prediction uncertainty quantification, autoencoder reconstruction error, and decentralized attack-resilient energy scheduling.

Result: The framework mitigated attack-induced economic losses by 34.7%, reduced false positives by 70%, restored 93.7% of degraded forecasting, and saved up to 5% in operational costs under extreme attack scenarios.

Conclusion: The integrated framework enhances security and operational performance for decentralized microgrid management, outperforming conventional single-signal approaches through precision-focused detection and multi-signal integration.

Abstract: Maintaining economic efficiency and operational reliability in microgrid energy management systems under cyberattack conditions remains challenging. Most approaches assume non-anomalous measurements, make predictions with unquantified uncertainties, and do not mitigate malicious attacks on renewable forecasts for energy management optimization. This paper presents a comprehensive cyber-resilient framework integrating federated Long Short-Term Memory-based photovoltaic forecasting with a novel two-stage cascade false data injection attack detection and energy management system optimization. The approach combines autoencoder reconstruction error with prediction uncertainty quantification to enable attack-resilient energy storage scheduling while preserving data privacy. Extreme false data attack conditions were studied that caused 58% forecast degradation and 16.9\% operational cost increases. The proposed integrated framework reduced false positive detections by 70%, recovered 93.7% of forecasting performance losses, and achieved 5\% operational cost savings, mitigating 34.7% of attack-induced economic losses. Results demonstrate that precision-focused cascade detection with multi-signal fusion outperforms single-signal approaches, validating security-performance synergy for decentralized microgrids.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Influence Score as a metric to assess token influence in state-space models like Mamba and evaluates it through multiple experiments on three model variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the internal dynamics of SSMs, particularly Mamba, lags behind that of attention-based models, necessitating tools to interpret and analyze their behavior.

Method: The paper introduces the Influence Score, derived from the state-space parameters, and evaluates it on model variants using six contextually diverse experiments.

Result: The Influence Score reflects model capacity, shows consistent architectural patterns across models, and reveals emergent behavior only at larger scales.

Conclusion: The Influence Score is a useful tool for analyzing and comparing state-space-based language models, providing insights into their internal mechanisms and behaviors.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have become powerful architectures for sequence modeling, yet their internal dynamics remain poorly understood compared to attention-based models. We introduce and validate the Influence Score, a controllability-based metric derived from the discretized state-space parameters of Mamba and computed through a backward recurrence analogous to system observability. The score quantifies how strongly a token at position k affects all later states and outputs. We evaluate this measure across three Mamba variants: mamba-130m, mamba-2.8b, and mamba-2.8b-slimpj, using six experiments that test its sensitivity to temperature, prompt complexity, token type, layer depth, token position, and input perturbations. The results show three main insights: (1) the Influence Score increases with model size and training data, reflecting model capacity; (2) Mamba exhibits consistent architectural patterns, including recency bias and concentrated influence in mid-to-late layers; and (3) emergent behaviors appear only at scale, with mamba-2.8b-slimpj uniquely prioritizing content words and reducing internal influence in the presence of noise. These findings establish the Influence Score as a practical diagnostic tool for interpreting and comparing SSM-based language models.

*Lei Xiao,Jifeng Li,Juntao Gao,Feiyang Ye,Yan Jin,Jingjing Qian,Jing Zhang,Yong Wu,Xiaoyuan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes AVA-VLA, a new framework to address limitations in current Vision-Language-Action models, enabling history-dependent dynamic visual processing and achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models often operate on dense visual inputs independently for each timestep, neglecting historical context, which limits their effectiveness in dynamic sequential decision-making tasks.

Method: The paper introduces AVA-VLA, which employs Active Visual Attention (AVA) to leverage a recurrent state (agent's belief state approximation) for history-informed visual token processing and task execution.

Result: The AVA-VLA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in robotic benchmarks such as LIBERO and CALVIN, and exhibits practical efficacy in real-world dual-arm robotic applications.

Conclusion: AVA-VLA effectively addresses the limitations of history-agnostic VLA models through history-aware active visual processing, proving robust in simulated and real-world settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in embodied AI tasks. However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an anomaly-resilient federated learning framework for EV charging infrastructure to ensure data privacy, detect cyber-attacks, and improve predictive accuracy under cyber threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cybersecurity challenges and limitations of current EV charging infrastructure prediction techniques that lack robust anomaly mitigation and privacy-preserving strategies.

Method: The framework utilizes three innovations: (1) Distributed anomaly detection with LSTM autoencoders, (2) Anomalous data mitigation through interpolation, and (3) Federated LSTM networks for collaborative learning without data centralization.

Result: The proposed method outperforms centralized models, improving R2 accuracy by 15.2%. It mitigates 47.9% of attack-induced performance degradation while achieving 91.3% precision and a 1.21% false positive rate.

Conclusion: This architecture enhances EV infrastructure planning, privacy-preserving predictions, and cybersecurity resilience, ensuring reliable recovery from malicious threats in distributed charging networks.

Abstract: Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure faces escalating cybersecurity threats that can severely compromise operational efficiency and grid stability. Existing forecasting techniques are limited by the lack of combined robust anomaly mitigation solutions and data privacy preservation. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel anomaly-resilient federated learning framework that simultaneously preserves data privacy, detects cyber-attacks, and maintains trustworthy demand prediction accuracy under adversarial conditions. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: LSTM autoencoder-based distributed anomaly detection deployed at each federated client, interpolation-based anomalous data mitigation to preserve temporal continuity, and federated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that enable collaborative learning without centralized data aggregation. The framework is validated on real-world EV charging infrastructure datasets combined with real-world DDoS attack datasets, providing robust validation of the proposed approach under realistic threat scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the federated approach achieves superior performance compared to centralized models, with 15.2% improvement in R2 accuracy while maintaining data locality. The integrated cyber-attack detection and mitigation system produces trustworthy datasets that enhance prediction reliability, recovering 47.9% of attack-induced performance degradation while maintaining exceptional precision (91.3%) and minimal false positive rates (1.21%). The proposed architecture enables enhanced EV infrastructure planning, privacy-preserving collaborative forecasting, cybersecurity resilience, and rapid recovery from malicious threats across distributed charging networks.

*Fabian Schramm,Nicolas Perrin-Gilbert,Justin Carpentier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A refinement to temporal-difference learning improves consistency by enforcing first-order Bellman targets in value and gradient, enhancing stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance convergence speed and stabilize policy gradients in reinforcement learning by ensuring Bellman consistency in value functions.

Method: First-order Bellman consistency is achieved through differentiable dynamics and a Sobolev-type loss for matching gradients and values in TD learning.

Result: Integrating this approach leads to faster critic convergence and more stable policy gradients without modifying existing algorithm structures.

Conclusion: First-order TD matching can improve existing RL algorithms like Q-learning and actor-critic methods with better efficiency and stability.

Abstract: We propose a refinement of temporal-difference learning that enforces first-order Bellman consistency: the learned value function is trained to match not only the Bellman targets in value but also their derivatives with respect to states and actions. By differentiating the Bellman backup through differentiable dynamics, we obtain analytically consistent gradient targets. Incorporating these into the critic objective using a Sobolev-type loss encourages the critic to align with both the value and local geometry of the target function. This first-order TD matching principle can be seamlessly integrated into existing algorithms, such as Q-learning or actor-critic methods (e.g., DDPG, SAC), potentially leading to faster critic convergence and more stable policy gradients without altering their overall structure.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DV-BASI, a novel algorithm that uses difference vectors to enhance task arithmetic for efficient model editing, achieving competitive or superior performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in computational cost and scalability of pre-trained model editing and to enhance the underexplored potential of task arithmetic methods.

Method: The authors propose the DV-BASI algorithm, which utilizes difference vectors derived from optimization trajectories to perform iterative, anisotropic scaling in task arithmetic without additional modules.

Result: DV-BASI improves multi-task and single-task model performance, often exceeding individually fine-tuned models, and achieves state-of-the-art results across various evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: DV-BASI provides an efficient, scalable framework for model editing and optimization, extending the potential of task arithmetic for practical fine-tuning and advanced model performance.

Abstract: Current methods for editing pre-trained models face significant challenges, primarily high computational costs and limited scalability. Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising solution, using simple arithmetic operations-addition and negation-based on task vectors which are the differences between fine-tuned and pre-trained model weights, to efficiently modify model behavior. However, the full potential of task arithmetic remains underexplored, primarily due to limited mechanisms for overcoming optimization stagnation. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of difference vector, a generalized form of task vectors derived from the historical movements during optimization. Using difference vectors as directed perturbations, we propose the Difference Vector-based Anisotropic Scaling Iterative algorithm (DV-BASI) to enable a continuous optimization process for task arithmetic methods without relying on any additional modules or components. Notably, by leveraging escapability and directional advantages of difference vectors, the average performance on different tasks of the multi-task model merged by DV-BASI may even outperform models individually fine-tuned. Based on this observation, we extend the application of difference vectors to a feasible fine-tuning method for single-task models. On the practical side, DV-BASI allows expressive searching directions with few learnable parameters and forms a scalable framework. We also integrate DV-BASI with task arithmetic methods and advanced optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both supervised and unsupervised evaluation protocols.

TL;DR: LEARN-Opt, a novel LLM-based framework, autonomously generates and evaluates reward functions for reinforcement learning, bypassing preliminary metrics and source code needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of manually designing reward functions in reinforcement learning, which is often time-consuming and requires extensive expertise.

Method: Proposes an LLM-based autonomous framework, LEARN-Opt, capable of unsupervised generation and evaluation of reward functions from system descriptions without requiring preliminary metrics or environmental source code.

Result: LEARN-Opt demonstrates comparable or superior performance to existing state-of-the-art methodologies while reducing prior knowledge requirements.

Conclusion: LEARN-Opt showcases the potential of low-cost LLMs to autonomously generate high-quality reward functions, minimizing engineering overhead and improving generalizability.

Abstract: The challenge of designing effective reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) represents a significant bottleneck, often requiring extensive human expertise and being time-consuming. Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models. This demonstrated performance affirms its potential to generate high-quality reward functions without requiring any preliminary human-defined metrics, thereby reducing engineering overhead and enhancing generalizability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called MGP-MIA to address membership inference attacks (MIAs) on multi-domain graph pre-trained models and reveals their privacy vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the privacy risks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs), in multi-domain graph pre-trained models since these risks remain largely unexamined.

Method: The paper proposes MGP-MIA, combining techniques like membership signal amplification via machine unlearning, incremental shadow model construction, and a similarity-based inference mechanism to tackle MIAs more effectively.

Result: The proposed MGP-MIA model demonstrated its effectiveness in exposing the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training through various experiments.

Conclusion: Multi-domain graph pre-trained models, though effective in generalization, are susceptible to MIAs. The proposed MGP-MIA framework sheds light on these vulnerabilities and highlights potential risks in their application.

Abstract: Multi-domain graph pre-training has emerged as a pivotal technique in developing graph foundation models. While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.

TL;DR: Introduction of ContagionRL, a reinforcement learning platform designed to explore how reward functions affect learned behaviors in spatial epidemic simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models often rely on fixed rules for agent behavior, ignoring the critical role of reward engineering and its effect on learning diverse survival strategies.

Method: The paper integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model into ContagionRL, evaluating five reward function designs across reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C) using systematic ablation and stress-testing methods.

Result: Directional guidance and adherence incentives are identified as essential for robust policy learning. Agents trained with a novel potential field reward function achieve superior survival outcomes by following non-pharmaceutical interventions and practicing spatial avoidance.

Conclusion: Reward function design significantly affects agent behavior in epidemic simulation models. ContagionRL provides a versatile framework for studying how reward engineering influences adaptation under varying conditions.

Abstract: We present ContagionRL, a Gymnasium-compatible reinforcement learning platform specifically designed for systematic reward engineering in spatial epidemic simulations. Unlike traditional agent-based models that rely on fixed behavioral rules, our platform enables rigorous evaluation of how reward function design affects learned survival strategies across diverse epidemic scenarios. ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable environmental parameters, allowing researchers to stress-test reward functions under varying conditions including limited observability, different movement patterns, and heterogeneous population dynamics. We evaluate five distinct reward designs, ranging from sparse survival bonuses to a novel potential field approach, across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C). Through systematic ablation studies, we identify that directional guidance and explicit adherence incentives are critical components for robust policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation across varying infection rates, grid sizes, visibility constraints, and movement patterns reveals that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes. Agents trained with our potential field reward consistently achieve superior performance, learning maximal adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions while developing sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies. The platform's modular design enables systematic exploration of reward-behavior relationships, addressing a knowledge gap in models of this type where reward engineering has received limited attention. ContagionRL is an effective platform for studying adaptive behavioral responses in epidemic contexts and highlight the importance of reward design, information structure, and environmental predictability in learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a theoretical framework for understanding feature dynamics in private machine learning, highlighting the impact of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on effective learning, and providing insights into challenges and solutions for DP-SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of theoretical understanding regarding feature dynamics in differentially private machine learning.

Method: The authors use a two-layer CNN with polynomial ReLU activation alongside noisy gradient descent to theoretically analyze private training through feature analysis and signal-to-noise ratio considerations.

Result: Theoretical findings indicate that private learning requires higher SNR for effective training and that data noise memorization seen in non-private learning is replicated in private learning, impacting generalization.

Conclusion: The study sheds light on the limitations and challenges of private learning, proving that feature enhancement can improve training performance and emphasizing the need for better approaches in DP-SGD training for robust learning outcomes.

Abstract: Differentially private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) has become integral to privacy-preserving machine learning, ensuring robust privacy guarantees in sensitive domains. Despite notable empirical advances leveraging features from non-private, pre-trained models to enhance DP-SGD training, a theoretical understanding of feature dynamics in private learning remains underexplored. This paper presents the first theoretical framework to analyze private training through a feature learning perspective. Building on the multi-patch data structure from prior work, our analysis distinguishes between label-dependent feature signals and label-independent noise, a critical aspect overlooked by existing analyses in the DP community. Employing a two-layer CNN with polynomial ReLU activation, we theoretically characterize both feature signal learning and data noise memorization in private training via noisy gradient descent. Our findings reveal that (1) Effective private signal learning requires a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to non-private training, and (2) When data noise memorization occurs in non-private learning, it will also occur in private learning, leading to poor generalization despite small training loss. Our findings highlight the challenges of private learning and prove the benefit of feature enhancement to improve SNR. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets also validate our theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines maintaining safety alignment in fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes a curvature-aware method for better safety behavior while preserving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks often leads to compromised safety alignment, posing risks when generating harmful content.

Method: The authors analyze the loss landscape geometry and propose a curvature-aware alignment restoration method that uses influence functions and second-order optimization to increase losses for harmful inputs, retaining task performance.

Result: The proposed method reduces harmful responses in fine-tuned LLMs while maintaining or improving task performance and few-shot learning capabilities.

Conclusion: Safety alignment can be preserved during fine-tuning through careful optimization techniques, enabling high performance and minimized risks of harmful content generation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks often compromises safety alignment, even when using parameter-efficient methods like LoRA. In this work, we uncover a notable property: fine-tuned models preserve the geometric structure of their loss landscapes concerning harmful content, regardless of the fine-tuning method employed. This suggests that safety behaviors are not erased but shifted to less influential regions of the parameter space. Building on this insight, we propose a curvature-aware alignment restoration method that leverages influence functions and second-order optimization to selectively increase loss on harmful inputs while preserving task performance. By navigating the shared geometry between base and fine-tuned models, our method discourages unsafe outputs while preserving task-relevant performance, avoiding full reversion and enabling precise, low-impact updates. Extensive evaluations across multiple model families and adversarial settings show that our approach efficiently reduces harmful responses while maintaining or even improving utility and few-shot learning performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces pFedBBN, a test-time adaptation framework in federated learning to address class imbalance and distribution shifts without requiring labeled data, improving robustness and minority-class performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to handle test-time adaptation in federated learning under challenges such as unseen domains, class imbalance, and distribution shifts without accessing labeled data or client coordination.

Method: pFedBBN utilizes balanced batch normalization during local client adaptation and facilitates client collaboration through BBN similarity, ensuring domain-specific generalization and fairness in class representation.

Result: pFedBBN demonstrates superior robustness and improved minority-class performance compared to existing test-time adaptation and federated learning methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses federated learning constraints such as privacy, class imbalance, and domain shifts, providing a personalized, unsupervised adaptation mechanism with promising results.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) in federated learning (FL) is crucial for handling unseen data distributions across clients, particularly when faced with domain shifts and skewed class distributions. Class Imbalance (CI) remains a fundamental challenge in FL, where rare but critical classes are often severely underrepresented in individual client datasets. Although prior work has addressed CI during training through reliable aggregation and local class distribution alignment, these methods typically rely on access to labeled data or coordination among clients, and none address class unsupervised adaptation to dynamic domains or distribution shifts at inference time under federated CI constraints. Revealing the failure of state-of-the-art TTA in federated client adaptation in CI scenario, we propose pFedBBN,a personalized federated test-time adaptation framework that employs balanced batch normalization (BBN) during local client adaptation to mitigate prediction bias by treating all classes equally, while also enabling client collaboration guided by BBN similarity, ensuring that clients with similar balanced representations reinforce each other and that adaptation remains aligned with domain-specific characteristics. pFedBBN supports fully unsupervised local adaptation and introduces a class-aware model aggregation strategy that enables personalized inference without compromising privacy. It addresses both distribution shifts and class imbalance through balanced feature normalization and domain-aware collaboration, without requiring any labeled or raw data from clients. Extensive experiments across diverse baselines show that pFedBBN consistently enhances robustness and minority-class performance over state-of-the-art FL and TTA methods.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates alignment strategies for LLMs in clinical decision-making, showing a preference for models prioritizing interpretability and feasibility over algorithmic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning large language models (LLMs) with the complex reasoning pathways required in real-world medicine, particularly in infertility treatment.

Method: The study systematically compared four alignment strategies (SFT, DPO, GRPO, ICL) using a dual-layer framework of automated testing and blinded doctor assessments on over 8,000 infertility treatment records.

Result: GRPO achieved the highest algorithmic accuracy, but clinicians preferred the SFT model for its clearer reasoning and practical feasibility. In pairwise comparisons, SFT outperformed GRPO and even original physician decisions.

Conclusion: The study highlights a paradox where high algorithmic accuracy does not ensure clinical trust. Future alignment strategies must emphasize interpretability and feasibility for better human-centric outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support, yet aligning them with the multifaceted reasoning pathways of real-world medicine remains a major challenge. Using more than 8,000 infertility treatment records, we systematically evaluate four alignment strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and In-Context Learning (ICL) through a dual-layer framework combining automatic benchmarks with blinded doctor-in-the-loop assessments. GRPO achieves the highest algorithmic accuracy across multiple decision layers, confirming the value of reinforcement-based optimization for structured prediction tasks. However, clinicians consistently prefer the SFT model, citing clearer reasoning processes (p = 0.035) and higher therapeutic feasibility (p = 0.019). In blinded pairwise comparisons, SFT attains the highest winning rate (51.2%), outperforming both GRPO (26.2%) and even physicians' original decisions (22.7%). These results reveal an alignment paradox: algorithmic improvements do not necessarily translate into higher clinical trust, and may diverge from human-centered preferences. Our findings highlight the need for alignment strategies that prioritize clinically interpretable and practically feasible reasoning, rather than solely optimizing decision-level accuracy.

Abstract: Predictive control approaches based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have gained significant attention in microgrid energy optimization. However, existing research often overlooks the issue of uncertainty stemming from imperfect prediction models, which can lead to suboptimal control strategies. This paper presents a new error temporal difference (ETD) algorithm for DRL to address the uncertainty in predictions,aiming to improve the performance of microgrid operations. First,a microgrid system integrated with renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage systems (ESS), along with its Markov decision process (MDP), is modelled. Second, a predictive control approach based on a deep Q network (DQN) is presented, in which a weighted average algorithm and a new ETD algorithm are designed to quantify and address the prediction uncertainty, respectively. Finally, simulations on a realworld US dataset suggest that the developed ETD effectively improves the performance of DRL in optimizing microgrid operations.

### [587] [Vulnerability-Aware Robust Multimodal Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18138)
*Junrui Zhang,Xinyu Zhao,Jie Peng,Chenjie Wang,Jianmin Ji,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method, VARMAT, for improving the robustness of multimodal learning models against adversarial attacks by accounting for modality vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal adversarial training methods fail to acknowledge the varying contributions of individual modalities to robustness, leading to suboptimal protection.

Method: The paper proposes VARMAT, which quantifies each modality's vulnerability using a first-order approximation and applies targeted regularization to penalize vulnerable modalities while preserving task accuracy.

Result: VARMAT achieves a significant robustness improvement of 12.73%, 22.21%, and 11.19% across three multimodal datasets.

Conclusion: Identifying and addressing vulnerability differences among modalities in adversarial training can substantially enhance multimodal model robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown significant superiority on various tasks by integrating multiple modalities. However, the interdependencies among modalities increase the susceptibility of multimodal models to adversarial attacks. Existing methods mainly focus on attacks on specific modalities or indiscriminately attack all modalities. In this paper, we find that these approaches ignore the differences between modalities in their contribution to final robustness, resulting in suboptimal robustness performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vulnerability-Aware Robust Multimodal Adversarial Training (VARMAT), a probe-in-training adversarial training method that improves multimodal robustness by identifying the vulnerability of each modality. To be specific, VARMAT first explicitly quantifies the vulnerability of each modality, grounded in a first-order approximation of the attack objective (Probe). Then, we propose a targeted regularization term that penalizes modalities with high vulnerability, guiding robust learning while maintaining task accuracy (Training). We demonstrate the enhanced robustness of our method across multiple multimodal datasets involving diverse modalities. Finally, we achieve {12.73%, 22.21%, 11.19%} robustness improvement on three multimodal datasets, revealing a significant blind spot in multimodal adversarial training.

*Randy Davila,Beyzanur Ispir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares CNNs and GNNs for approximating the domination number of graphs and finds GNNs outperform CNNs in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact computation of the domination number is NP-hard, prompting the need for efficient machine learning surrogates for scalability and practical application.

Method: CNNs and GNNs are analyzed across 2,000 random graphs using adjacency matrices and graph structure, respectively, to approximate the domination number.

Result: GNNs surpass CNNs with higher accuracy ($R^2=0.987$, MAE $=0.372$) and greater computational efficiency (over $200	imes$ acceleration), demonstrating utility in large-scale problems.

Conclusion: GNNs serve as effective surrogates for graph invariants, offering potential for scalable optimization and aiding mathematical graph discovery.

Abstract: We investigate machine learning approaches to approximating the \emph{domination number} of graphs, the minimum size of a dominating set. Exact computation of this parameter is NP-hard, restricting classical methods to small instances. We compare two neural paradigms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which operate on adjacency matrix representations, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which learn directly from graph structure through message passing. Across 2,000 random graphs with up to 64 vertices, GNNs achieve markedly higher accuracy ($R^2=0.987$, MAE $=0.372$) than CNNs ($R^2=0.955$, MAE $=0.500$). Both models offer substantial speedups over exact solvers, with GNNs delivering more than $200\times$ acceleration while retaining near-perfect fidelity. Our results position GNNs as a practical surrogate for combinatorial graph invariants, with implications for scalable graph optimization and mathematical discovery.

### [589] [LocaGen: Low-Overhead Indoor Localization Through Spatial Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18158)
*Abdelrahman Abdelmotlb,Abdallah Taman,Sherif Mostafa,Moustafa Youssef*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LocaGen employs a conditional diffusion model and a novel spatial strategy to generate high-quality synthetic fingerprints for indoor localization, reducing by up to 30% the need for data collection while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extensive signal data collection required in fingerprinting methods for indoor localization, which limits their widespread application.

Method: LocaGen introduces spatial augmentation with a conditional diffusion model guided by spatial optimization, heuristic-based data augmentation, and a density-oriented approach for selecting locations.

Result: LocaGen achieves comparable localization accuracy at unseen locations with up to 30% data reduction and outperforms existing augmentation approaches by up to 28% in accuracy.

Conclusion: LocaGen enables efficient indoor localization by reducing overhead while maintaining or improving accuracy, paving the way for practical, real-world deployment.

Abstract: Indoor localization systems commonly rely on fingerprinting, which requires extensive survey efforts to obtain location-tagged signal data, limiting their real-world deployability. Recent approaches that attempt to reduce this overhead either suffer from low representation ability, mode collapse issues, or require the effort of collecting data at all target locations. We present LocaGen, a novel spatial augmentation framework that significantly reduces fingerprinting overhead by generating high-quality synthetic data at completely unseen locations. LocaGen leverages a conditional diffusion model guided by a novel spatially aware optimization strategy to synthesize realistic fingerprints at unseen locations using only a subset of seen locations. To further improve our diffusion model performance, LocaGen augments seen location data based on domain-specific heuristics and strategically selects the seen and unseen locations using a novel density-based approach that ensures robust coverage. Our extensive evaluation on a real-world WiFi fingerprinting dataset shows that LocaGen maintains the same localization accuracy even with 30% of the locations unseen and achieves up to 28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art augmentation methods.

### [590] [Bringing Stability to Diffusion: Decomposing and Reducing Variance of Training Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18159)
*Mengni Jia,Mengyu Zhou,Yihao Liu,Xiaoxi Jiang,Guanjun Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses high variance issues in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), introducing methods that significantly improve performance and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDMs, despite their potential, suffer from unstable optimization due to higher training variance compared to ARMs during task-specific training.

Method: The authors decompose MDM variance into three sources and propose variance-reduction techniques, such as P-POTS and MIRROR, to mitigate these issues.

Result: Experimental results show a 7-8% accuracy enhancement on complex reasoning tasks and reduced variability, closing the gap with Autoregressive Models (ARM).

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address high training variance in MDMs, enhancing their reliability and performance on challenging tasks.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) are a promising alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs), but they suffer from inherently much higher training variance. High variance leads to noisier gradient estimates and unstable optimization, so even equally strong pretrained MDMs and ARMs that are competitive at initialization often diverge after task-specific training, with MDMs falling far behind. There has been no theoretical explanation or systematic solution. We derive the first decomposition of MDM training variance into three sources: (A) masking pattern noise, (B) masking rate noise, and (C) data noise, while ARMs are only affected by (C). This explains the fundamental training gap. Building on this foundation, we design six variance-reduction methods, including two core methods: (1) P-POTS, a Pareto-optimal t sampler that minimizes training variance by sampling harder t values more often with appropriately smaller update steps, and (2) MIRROR, which uses negatively correlated samples to reduce (A). Experiments show that compared to standard MDM training, our methods improve accuracy by 7-8% on complex reasoning tasks, while simultaneously reducing run-to-run variability to near ARM levels, substantially narrowing the gap with strong ARM baselines; in most settings, even the best baseline runs remain below the worst run of our method.

### [591] [Bayesian Calibration of Engine-out NOx Models for Engine-to-Engine Transferability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18178)
*Shrenik Zinage,Peter Meckl,Ilias Bilionis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian calibration framework to address engine-specific biases and improve NOx prediction accuracy without retraining models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engine-out NOx prediction is essential for meeting emissions regulations and traditional approaches struggle to generalize across different engine populations due to biases and variability.

Method: The authors developed a Bayesian calibration framework combining Gaussian processes with approximate Bayesian computation to identify and adjust for engine-specific sensor biases.

Result: The approach achieved highly accurate NOx predictions on test data and showed significant improvement over non-adaptive models, addressing variability and enhancing generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles engine-to-engine variability, improves predictions, and eliminates the need for model retraining, offering a reliable transferable solution.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of engine-out NOx is essential for meeting stringent emissions regulations and optimizing engine performance. Traditional approaches rely on models trained on data from a small number of engines, which can be insufficient in generalizing across an entire population of engines due to sensor biases and variations in input conditions. In real world applications, these models require tuning or calibration to maintain acceptable error tolerance when applied to other engines. This highlights the need for models that can adapt with minimal adjustments to accommodate engine-to-engine variability and sensor discrepancies. While previous studies have explored machine learning methods for predicting engine-out NOx, these approaches often fail to generalize reliably across different engines and operating environments. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian calibration framework that combines Gaussian processes with approximate Bayesian computation to infer and correct sensor biases. Starting with a pre-trained model developed using nominal engine data, our method identifies engine specific sensor biases and recalibrates predictions accordingly. By incorporating these inferred biases, our approach generates posterior predictive distributions for engine-out NOx on unseen test data, achieving high accuracy without retraining the model. Our results demonstrate that this transferable modeling approach significantly improves the accuracy of predictions compared to conventional non-adaptive GP models, effectively addressing engine-to-engine variability and improving model generalizability.

### [592] [MOMA-AC: A preference-driven actor-critic framework for continuous multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18181)
*Adam Callaghan,Karl Mason,Patrick Mannion*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MOMA-AC, the first inner-loop actor-critic framework for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL) in continuous state and action spaces. It leverages TD3 and DDPG to model the Pareto front effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for scalable and robust policy learning in continuous multi-agent environments with conflicting multi-objective settings.

Method: Developed MOMA-AC framework with multi-headed actor network, centralized critic, and preference-conditioning architecture. Evaluated using tasks in a combined multi-agent, multi-objective test suite.

Result: Results showed significant improvements in expected utility and hypervolume, outperforming baselines while scaling well with an increasing number of agents.

Conclusion: MOMA-AC provides a strong foundation for multi-objective policy learning, showing robustness and scalability in continuous domains.

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL) by introducing the first dedicated inner-loop actor-critic framework for continuous state and action spaces: Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MOMA-AC). Building on single-objective, single-agent algorithms, we instantiate this framework with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), yielding MOMA-TD3 and MOMA-DDPG. The framework combines a multi-headed actor network, a centralised critic, and an objective preference-conditioning architecture, enabling a single neural network to encode the Pareto front of optimal trade-off policies for all agents across conflicting objectives in a continuous MOMARL setting. We also outline a natural test suite for continuous MOMARL by combining a pre-existing multi-agent single-objective physics simulator with its multi-objective single-agent counterpart. Evaluating cooperative locomotion tasks in this suite, we show that our framework achieves statistically significant improvements in expected utility and hypervolume relative to outer-loop and independent training baselines, while demonstrating stable scalability as the number of agents increases. These results establish our framework as a foundational step towards robust, scalable multi-objective policy learning in continuous multi-agent domains.

### [593] [Accelerating Time Series Foundation Models with Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18191)
*Pranav Subbaraman,Fang Sun,Yue Yao,Huacong Tang,Xiao Luo,Yizhou Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to speed up time-series forecasting in latency-sensitive web applications using speculative decoding with a smaller draft model assisting a larger one, achieving significant speedups without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the computational inefficiency of Transformer-based time-series forecasting models, which limits their use in latency-sensitive web applications despite achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Method: A speculative decoding framework is devised where a smaller 'draft' model predicts future time-series patches that are verified in parallel by a larger 'target' model. Techniques to adapt this method to continuous time-series data and optimize efficiency and accuracy are addressed.

Result: Experiments on time-series forecasting benchmarks show remarkable inference speedups while maintaining accuracy, proving the method's effectiveness for web application scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables faster and efficient time-series forecasting without needing architectural changes, making it readily applicable to existing web application systems.

Abstract: Modern web applications--from real-time content recommendation and dynamic pricing to CDN optimization--increasingly rely on time-series forecasting to deliver personalized experiences to billions of users. Large-scale Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time-series forecasting but suffer from high computational costs, limiting their deployment in latency-sensitive web applications. To address this challenge, we propose a general inference acceleration framework that adapts speculative decoding to autoregressive time-series models. Our approach employs a smaller "draft" model to propose future time-series patches, which are then verified in parallel by a larger "target" model, reducing the number of sequential forward passes required. We address key technical challenges in adapting this technique from discrete language tokens to continuous time-series distributions, including the design of acceptance criteria for multivariate Gaussian patches and practical variants that balance efficiency with accuracy. Through experiments on time series forecasting benchmarks relevant to web applications, we demonstrate significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive accuracy. The framework requires no architectural modifications to existing foundation models, making it immediately applicable to accelerate deployed time-series forecasting systems.

### [594] [How Learning Rate Decay Wastes Your Best Data in Curriculum-Based LLM Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18903)
*Kairong Luo,Zhenbo Sun,Haodong Wen,Xinyu Shi,Jiarui Cui,Chenyi Dang,Kaifeng Lyu,Wenguang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses how curriculum-based pretraining strategies for large language models (LLMs) can be improved by addressing the incompatibility between data quality order and a decaying learning rate schedule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges caused by training large language models on datasets with varying quality levels and to optimize the use of high-quality data through curriculum-based pretraining.

Method: The paper incorporates two solutions: (1) using a moderate learning rate decay schedule and (2) replacing learning rate decay with model averaging in order to better align curriculum-based training with optimization methods.

Result: The proposed strategies enhanced performance, achieving a 1.64% improvement in benchmark scores over random shuffling, validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained on 30B tokens using various data-quality metrics.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that co-designing curriculum-based pretraining with optimization strategies can significantly improve model performance and encourages reconsideration of such training paradigms.

Abstract: Due to the scarcity of high-quality data, large language models (LLMs) are often trained on mixtures of data with varying quality levels, even after sophisticated data curation. A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric. However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies. This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule. We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement. Validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained over 30B tokens with various data-quality metrics, our findings call for a re-evaluation of curriculum-based LLM pretraining and underscore the potential of co-designing data curricula with optimization methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPPO, an RL algorithm integrating Deep Gaussian Processes for better uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of calibrated uncertainty estimates in deep neural networks for reinforcement learning, crucial for safe exploration.

Method: GPPO integrates Deep Gaussian Processes into a scalable, actor-critic model-free method to approximate policies and value functions.

Result: GPPO achieves competitive performance with Proximal Policy Optimization on benchmarks, offering better-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: GPPO enhances RL by balancing performance with improved uncertainty estimates, aiding safer exploration and learning.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a critical component in control tasks where agents must balance safe exploration and efficient learning. While deep neural networks have enabled breakthroughs in RL, they often lack calibrated uncertainty estimates. We introduce Deep Gaussian Process Proximal Policy Optimization (GPPO), a scalable, model-free actor-critic algorithm that leverages Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) to approximate both the policy and value function. GPPO maintains competitive performance with respect to Proximal Policy Optimization on standard high-dimensional continuous control benchmarks while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates that can inform safer and more effective exploration.

*Santhosh G S,Saurav Prakash,Balaraman Ravindran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SWAN introduces a memory-efficient method for optimizing Large Language Models, providing high compression rates without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the memory bottleneck in LLMs caused by the KV-cache during inference, while overcoming limitations of current compression techniques.

Method: Introduce SWAN—a framework utilizing orthogonal matrix rotation and pruning, eliminating decompression overhead, and leveraging a dense buffer.

Result: SWAN achieves 50-60% memory savings while maintaining near-original performance, with flexibility in compression levels.

Conclusion: SWAN is a practical solution for efficiently serving LLMs with long contexts, balancing performance and memory reduction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant bottleneck during autoregressive inference due to the massive memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing compression techniques like token eviction, quantization, or other low-rank methods often risk information loss, have fixed limits, or introduce significant computational overhead from explicit decompression steps. In this work, we introduce SWAN, a novel, fine-tuning-free framework that eliminates this overhead. Our method uses an offline orthogonal matrix to rotate and prune the KV-cache, which is then used directly in the attention computation without any reconstruction. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAN, augmented with a small dense buffer, offers a robust trade-off, maintaining performance close to the uncompressed baseline even at aggressive 50-60% memory savings per-token on KV-cache. A key advantage is its runtime-tunable compression level, allowing operators to dynamically adjust the memory footprint, a flexibility absent in methods requiring fixed offline configurations. This combination of a decompression-free design, high performance under compression, and adaptability makes SWAN a practical and efficient solution for serving LLMs with long contexts.

### [597] [Tail Distribution of Regret in Optimistic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18247)
*Sajad Khodadadian,Mehrdad Moharrami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper derives new tail bounds for regret in episodic reinforcement learning with two exploration schemes, offering detailed insights into the distribution of cumulative regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the distribution of cumulative regret in reinforcement learning is essential for characterizing both performance guarantees and potential risk.

Method: Instance-dependent tail bounds are derived for the cumulative regret under UCBVI-type algorithms, analyzing two exploration-bonus schemes and introducing a tuning parameter for balancing performance.

Result: The authors establish sub-Gaussian and sub-Weibull tail bounds for regret distribution, along with corresponding expected regret bounds. The analysis highlights a distinctive two-regime structure in the tail distribution.

Conclusion: The findings provide comprehensive tail-regret guarantees for optimistic reinforcement learning algorithms and improve the understanding of episodic reinforcement learning performance.

Abstract: We derive instance-dependent tail bounds for the regret of optimism-based reinforcement learning in finite-horizon tabular Markov decision processes with unknown transition dynamics. Focusing on a UCBVI-type algorithm, we characterize the tail distribution of the cumulative regret $R_K$ over $K$ episodes, rather than only its expectation or a single high-probability quantile. We analyze two natural exploration-bonus schedules: (i) a $K$-dependent scheme that explicitly incorporates the total number of episodes $K$, and (ii) a $K$-independent scheme that depends only on the current episode index. For both settings, we obtain an upper bound on $\Pr(R_K \ge x)$ that exhibits a distinctive two-regime structure: a sub-Gaussian tail starting from an instance-dependent scale $m_K$ up to a transition threshold, followed by a sub-Weibull tail beyond that point. We further derive corresponding instance-dependent bounds on the expected regret $\mathbb{E}[R_K]$. The proposed algorithm depends on a tuning parameter $α$, which balances the expected regret and the range over which the regret exhibits a sub-Gaussian tail. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide one of the first comprehensive tail-regret guarantees for a standard optimistic algorithm in episodic reinforcement learning.

### [598] [Coherent Multi-Agent Trajectory Forecasting in Team Sports with CausalTraj](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18248)
*Wei Zhen Teoh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CausalTraj is introduced as a model designed to generate realistic joint multi-agent trajectory forecasts, emphasizing metrics that evaluate collective behavior rather than individual performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent trajectory forecasting models often focus on individual accuracy and neglect coherence in joint scenarios, leading to limitations in applications like sports analytics.

Method: CausalTraj leverages temporally causal, likelihood-based modeling and introduces joint metrics like minJADE and minJFDE to evaluate collective accuracy across agents.

Result: CausalTraj outperformed on joint metrics in datasets like NBA SportVU, Basketball-U, and Football-U, achieving competitive individual predictions and producing realistic gameplay scenarios.

Conclusion: CausalTraj provides a robust framework for multi-agent trajectory predictions, addressing the shortcomings of traditional metrics to ensure coherent group dynamics and realistic simulations.

Abstract: Jointly forecasting trajectories of multiple interacting agents is a core challenge in sports analytics and other domains involving complex group dynamics. Accurate prediction enables realistic simulation and strategic understanding of gameplay evolution. Most existing models are evaluated solely on per-agent accuracy metrics (minADE, minFDE), which assess each agent independently on its best-of-k prediction. However these metrics overlook whether the model learns which predicted trajectories can jointly form a plausible multi-agent future. Many state-of-the-art models are designed and optimized primarily based on these metrics. As a result, they may underperform on joint predictions and also fail to generate coherent, interpretable multi-agent scenarios in team sports. We propose CausalTraj, a temporally causal, likelihood-based model that is built to generate jointly probable multi-agent trajectory forecasts. To better assess collective modeling capability, we emphasize joint metrics (minJADE, minJFDE) that measure joint accuracy across agents within the best generated scenario sample. Evaluated on the NBA SportVU, Basketball-U, and Football-U datasets, CausalTraj achieves competitive per-agent accuracy and the best recorded results on joint metrics, while yielding qualitatively coherent and realistic gameplay evolutions.

*Yueqi Wang,Guang Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RB-DeepONet introduces a hybrid operator-learning framework combining reduced-basis (RB) numerical methods with DeepONet architecture for solving parametric PDEs more efficiently and interpretably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies in solving large finite-element systems repeatedly in parametric PDE applications, and overcome limitations in existing operator-learning methods.

Method: RB-DeepONet integrates RB methods with DeepONet, embodying a branch network for coefficient prediction, fixed trunk based on RB space, and label-free training through projected variational residuals. Includes techniques to handle variable boundary and source data.

Result: RB-DeepONet achieves competitive accuracy with fewer parameters than alternative methods, offers speed improvements, and permits a strict offline-online computation split with convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: RB-DeepONet is an efficient, stable, and interpretable solution for large-scale parametric PDEs, improving computational performance and reducing reliance on extensive labeled datasets.

Abstract: Parametric PDEs power modern simulation, design, and digital-twin systems, yet their many-query workloads still hinge on repeatedly solving large finite-element systems. Existing operator-learning approaches accelerate this process but often rely on opaque learned trunks, require extensive labeled data, or break down when boundary and source data vary independently from physical parameters. We introduce RB-DeepONet, a hybrid operator-learning framework that fuses reduced-basis (RB) numerical structure with the branch-trunk architecture of DeepONet. The trunk is fixed to a rigorously constructed RB space generated offline via Greedy selection, granting physical interpretability, stability, and certified error control. The branch network predicts only RB coefficients and is trained label-free using a projected variational residual that targets the RB-Galerkin solution. For problems with independently varying loads or boundary conditions, we develop boundary and source modal encodings that compress exogenous data into low-dimensional coordinates while preserving accuracy. Combined with affine or empirical interpolation decompositions, RB-DeepONet achieves a strict offline-online split: all heavy lifting occurs offline, and online evaluation scales only with the RB dimension rather than the full mesh. We provide convergence guarantees separating RB approximation error from statistical learning error, and numerical experiments show that RB-DeepONet attains accuracy competitive with intrusive RB-Galerkin, POD-DeepONet, and FEONet while using dramatically fewer trainable parameters and achieving significant speedups. This establishes RB-DeepONet as an efficient, stable, and interpretable operator learner for large-scale parametric PDEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address significant challenges in moderating complex video advertisements, focusing on fine-grained understanding, explainability, and generalization.

Method: RAVEN++ introduces Active Reinforcement Learning, hierarchical reward functions, reasoning distillation, and Progressive Multi-Stage Training for improved performance.

Result: Experiments show RAVEN++ achieves superior violation understanding, reasoning, and generalization compared to general-purpose LLMs and previous models like RAVEN.

Conclusion: RAVEN++ is a robust framework enhancing fine-grained moderation of video advertisements and provides scalable advancements in understanding violations.

Abstract: Advertising (Ad) is a cornerstone of the digital economy, yet the moderation of video advertisements remains a significant challenge due to their complexity and the need for precise violation localization. While recent advancements, such as the RAVEN model, have improved coarse-grained violation detection, critical gaps persist in fine-grained understanding, explainability, and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose RAVEN++, a novel framework that introduces three key innovations: 1) Active Reinforcement Learning (RL), which dynamically adapts training to samples of varying difficulty; 2) Fine-Grained Violation Understanding, achieved through hierarchical reward functions and reasoning distillation; and 3) Progressive Multi-Stage Training, which systematically combines knowledge injection, curriculum-based passive RL, and active RL. Extensive experiments on both public and proprietary datasets, on both offline scenarios and online deployed A/B Testing, demonstrate that RAVEN++ outperforms general-purpose LLMs and specialized models like RAVEN in terms of fine-grained violation understanding, reasoning capabilities, and generalization ability.

*Ved Mohan,El Mehdi Er Raqabi,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses resource imbalances in logistics networks by combining operations research and machine learning to develop a fair and efficient resource substitution framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent challenge of ensuring the right resources are available in large-scale logistics networks, especially under uneven demand patterns and asymmetric resource flow.

Method: Developed a framework that integrates operations research for modeling the resource substitution problem under fairness considerations and machine learning to optimize computational efficiency and incorporate scheduler preferences.

Result: The approach achieved significant performance improvements, including 80% reduction in model size and 90% decrease in execution time while maintaining optimality in real-world logistics scenarios.

Conclusion: The combination of operations research and machine learning offers an effective, fair, and efficient solution to resource substitution problems in large-scale logistics networks, with real-world validation from a major case study.

Abstract: Ensuring that the right resource is available at the right location and time remains a major challenge for organizations operating large-scale logistics networks. The challenge comes from uneven demand patterns and the resulting asymmetric flow of resources across the arcs, which create persistent imbalances at the network nodes. Resource substitution among multiple, potentially composite and interchangeable, resource types is a cost-effective way to mitigate these imbalances. This leads to the resource substitution problem, which aims at determining the minimum number of resource substitutions from an initial assignment to minimize the overall network imbalance. In decentralized settings, achieving globally coordinated solutions becomes even more difficult. When substitution entails costs, effective prescriptions must also incorporate fairness and account for the individual preferences of schedulers. This paper presents a generic framework that combines operations research (OR) and machine learning (ML) to enable fair resource substitution in large networks. The OR component models and solves the resource substitution problem under a fairness lens. The ML component leverages historical data to learn schedulers' preferences, guide intelligent exploration of the decision space, and enhance computational efficiency by dynamically selecting the top-$κ$ resources for each arc in the network. The framework produces a portfolio of high-quality solutions from which schedulers can select satisfactory trade-offs. The proposed framework is applied to the network of one of the largest package delivery companies in the world, which serves as the primary motivation for this research. Computational results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including an 80% reduction in model size and a 90% decrease in execution time while preserving optimality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dietary behaviors and metabolic health are influenced by hunger and satiety but are challenging to track in everyday environments.

Method: The NPLM model uses embeddings from wearable PPG data and meal descriptions, enabling joint reasoning via language models. It was trained on a large dataset of participants and meal-PPG pairs.

Result: The model improved caloric intake prediction by 11% compared to text-only baselines and maintained accuracy with reduced meal text in a validation study.

Conclusion: Integrating wearable physiological data with meal descriptions provides a scalable and noninvasive approach to dietary behavior monitoring.

Abstract: Hunger and satiety dynamics shape dietary behaviors and metabolic health, yet remain difficult to capture in everyday settings. We present a Nutrition Photoplethysmography Language Model (NPLM), integrating continuous photoplethysmography (PPG) from wearables with meal descriptions. NPLM projects PPG into embeddings interpretable by language models, enabling joint reasoning over physiology and meal context. Trained on 19,340 participants and 1.1 million meal-PPG pairs, the model improved daily caloric intake prediction by 11% over text-only baselines, with accuracy maintained when 80% of meal text was removed. In an independent validation study (n=140) with controlled dining and detailed meal information, the model replicated these findings. These results demonstrate the value of integrating physiological measurements from consumer wearables with meal information for noninvasive dietary monitoring at scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the inductive biases and signal reconstruction behavior of TabPFN, showcasing its frequency capacity, spectral adaptivity, and tasks beyond tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the inductive biases and in-context learning behavior of TabPFN and explore its potential for broader applications.

Method: The authors conduct a frequency-based analysis of TabPFN's behavior, focusing on spectral capacities, adaptivity, and positional encoding effects.

Result: TabPFN was found to possess greater effective frequency capacity and adaptive spectral behavior compared to ReLU-MLPs, and showed promise in training-free image denoising.

Conclusion: TabPFN has unique inductive biases like Spectral Adaptivity and robust performance, suggesting its utility for broader signal reconstruction tasks beyond tabular data.

Abstract: Task-agnostic tabular foundation models such as TabPFN have achieved impressive performance on tabular learning tasks, yet the origins of their inductive biases remain poorly understood. In this work, we study TabPFN through the lens of signal reconstruction and provide the first frequency-based analysis of its in-context learning behavior. We show that TabPFN possesses a broader effective frequency capacity than standard ReLU-MLPs, even without hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, unlike MLPs whose spectra evolve primarily over training epochs, we find that TabPFN's spectral capacity adapts directly to the number of samples provided in-context, a phenomenon we term Spectral Adaptivity. We further demonstrate that positional encoding modulates TabPFN's frequency response, mirroring classical results in implicit neural representations. Finally, we show that these properties enable TabPFN to perform training-free and hyperparameter-free image denoising, illustrating its potential as a task-agnostic implicit model. Our analysis provides new insight into the structure and inductive biases of tabular foundation models and highlights their promise for broader signal reconstruction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the slow inference of Diffusion Language Models caused by numerous refinement steps and their incompatibility with standard KV caching for efficient text generation.

Method: The authors propose integrating consistency modeling into DLMs to enable multi-token finalization, reducing sampling steps, and applying block-wise causal attention masking during fine-tuning, ensuring compatibility with KV caching.

Result: CDLM achieves a 3.6x-14.5x reduction in inference latency while maintaining competitive accuracy for tasks such as math and coding.

Conclusion: CDLM significantly improves the inference speed of DLMs without sacrificing accuracy, enabling a more practical approach to parallel language generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising parallel generation paradigm but suffer from slow inference due to numerous refinement steps and the inability to use standard KV caching. We introduce CDLM (Consistency Diffusion Language Models), a training-based acceleration method that simultaneously tackles both bottlenecks. CDLM integrates consistency modeling to drastically reduce the number of required sampling steps by enabling multi-token finalization. Furthermore, we enforce a block-wise causal attention mask during fine-tuning, making the model fully compatible with KV caching.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRIDENT, a framework that synthesizes cell morphology using perturbation and gene expression data, showing improvements in predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately model the causal links between perturbations, gene expression, and cellular morphology for developing predictive AI Virtual Cells.

Method: The TRIDENT framework uses a cascade generative approach and incorporates RNA data to refine cellular phenome predictions. It is trained on MorphoGene—a dataset combining gene expression data and cellular image profiles.

Result: TRIDENT outperforms existing methods up to 7-fold, generalizes to unseen drugs, and accurately maps RNA to phenotype in validation studies.

Conclusion: TRIDENT enhances in silico modeling of transcriptome-phenome interactions, advancing predictive capabilities for virtual cell development.

Abstract: Accurately modeling the relationship between perturbations, transcriptional responses, and phenotypic changes is essential for building an AI Virtual Cell (AIVC). However, existing methods typically constrained to modeling direct associations, such as Perturbation $\rightarrow$ RNA or Perturbation $\rightarrow$ Morphology, overlook the crucial causal link from RNA to morphology. To bridge this gap, we propose TRIDENT, a cascade generative framework that synthesizes realistic cellular morphology by conditioning on both the perturbation and the corresponding gene expression profile. To train and evaluate this task, we construct MorphoGene, a new dataset pairing L1000 gene expression with Cell Painting images for 98 compounds. TRIDENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 7-fold improvement with strong generalization to unseen compounds. In a case study on docetaxel, we validate that RNA-guided synthesis accurately produces the corresponding phenotype. An ablation study further confirms that this RNA conditioning is essential for the model's high fidelity. By explicitly modeling transcriptome-phenome mapping, TRIDENT provides a powerful in silico tool and moves us closer to a predictive virtual cell.

TL;DR: MapFormers are Transformer-based models capable of learning cognitive maps for better structural relationship understanding and OOD generalization with a focus on positional encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack the ability to flexibly learn abstract relationships and generalize out-of-distribution, as humans and animals do with cognitive maps.

Method: The authors propose MapFormers, models leveraging Transformer architectures with updated input-dependent positional encoding to disentangle structure from content for cognitive map learning.

Result: MapFormers demonstrate near-perfect performance and OOD generalization in several tasks, including 2D navigation, outperforming existing AI architectures.

Conclusion: MapFormers highlight the potential of leveraging input-dependent positional encoding for cognitive map modeling, with applications in AI and neuroscience for understanding relationship structures.

Abstract: A cognitive map is an internal model which encodes the abstract relationships among entities in the world, giving humans and animals the flexibility to adapt to new situations, with a strong out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization that current AI systems still do not possess. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding. MapFormers have broad applications in both neuroscience and AI, by explaining the neural mechanisms giving rise to cognitive maps, while allowing these relation models to be learned at scale.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GROOT, a framework combining chip design knowledge, graph theory, and GPU kernel design to improve the efficiency of circuit verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and high computational demands of traditional verification methods in chip design, especially for large-scale circuits, by utilizing GNNs and a joint design framework.

Method: GROOT integrates domain-specific features of And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs), graph partitioning, a graph edge re-growth algorithm, and optimized GPU kernel designs (HD and LD kernels) to enhance verification tasks.

Result: GROOT achieves a 59.38% reduction in memory usage, high accuracy of 99.96% on a 1,024-bit CSA multiplier with large-scale graph processing, and significant runtime improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed GROOT framework demonstrates its capability to substantially enhance circuit verification efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, outperforming both traditional and GPU-based methods in critical tasks.

Abstract: Traditional verification methods in chip design are highly time-consuming and computationally demanding, especially for large scale circuits. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity as a potential solution to improve verification efficiency. However, there lacks a joint framework that considers all chip design domain knowledge, graph theory, and GPU kernel designs. To address this challenge, we introduce GROOT, an algorithm and system co-design framework that contains chip design domain knowledge and redesigned GPU kernels, to improve verification efficiency. More specifically, we create node features utilizing the circuit node types and the polarity of the connections between the input edges to nodes in And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs). We utilize a graph partitioning algorithm to divide the large graphs into smaller sub-graphs for fast GPU processing and develop a graph edge re-growth algorithm to recover verification accuracy. We carefully profile the EDA graph workloads and observe the uniqueness of their polarized distribution of high degree (HD) nodes and low degree (LD) nodes. We redesign two GPU kernels (HD-kernel and LD-kernel), to fit the EDA graph learning workload on a single GPU. We compare the results with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods: GAMORA, a GNN-based approach, and the traditional ABC framework. Results show that GROOT achieves a significant reduction in memory footprint (59.38 %), with high accuracy (99.96%) for a very large CSA multiplier, i.e. 1,024 bits with a batch size of 16, which consists of 134,103,040 nodes and 268,140,544 edges. We compare GROOT with GPU-based GPU Kernel designs SOTAs such as cuSPARSE, MergePath-SpMM, and GNNAdvisor. We achieve up to 1.104x, 5.796x, and 1.469x improvement in runtime, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a local hierarchical deep research agent for material and device discovery challenges, outperforming certain commercial systems in producing high-quality, actionable research outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle complex material and device discovery issues beyond the capacities of current ML models and commercial agents while offering localized integration and cost efficiency.

Method: A locally deployable research agent that uses retrieval-augmented generation, large language models (LLMs), and a Deep Tree of Research (DToR) mechanism to optimize research coverage and coherence. Evaluations included both systematic rubric-based assessments and dry-lab validations.

Result: Results indicate that the DR agent delivers research-quality reports equivalent to or better than commercial systems, while achieving reduced costs and enabling local data/tool integration.

Conclusion: This framework is a cost-efficient solution that improves report quality, integrates local resources, and addresses the limitations of existing ML and commercial systems.

Abstract: We present a long-horizon, hierarchical deep research (DR) agent designed for complex materials and device discovery problems that exceed the scope of existing Machine Learning (ML) surrogates and closed-source commercial agents. Our framework instantiates a locally deployable DR instance that integrates local retrieval-augmented generation with large language model reasoners, enhanced by a Deep Tree of Research (DToR) mechanism that adaptively expands and prunes research branches to maximize coverage, depth, and coherence. We systematically evaluate across 27 nanomaterials/device topics using a large language model (LLM)-as-judge rubric with five web-enabled state-of-the-art models as jurors. In addition, we conduct dry-lab validations on five representative tasks, where human experts use domain simulations (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) to verify whether DR-agent proposals are actionable. Results show that our DR agent produces reports with quality comparable to--and often exceeding--those of commercial systems (ChatGPT-5-thinking/o3/o4-mini-high Deep Research) at a substantially lower cost, while enabling on-prem integration with local data and tools.

TL;DR: Advances a State Space Model via two enhancements for generating realistic time series while tackling privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series data synthesis methods via diffusion models struggle with long-range dependencies and inter-channel relations.

Method: Proposes Lag Fusion Mamba and Permutation Scanning Mamba to enhance the State Space Model, culminating in the Diffusion Mamba for Time Series (DiM-TS).

Result: DiM-TS excels in generating high-quality time series data with realistic temporal and inter-channel properties, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves time series generation by addressing limitations of existing diffusion models through state-of-the-art advancements.

Abstract: Time series data plays a pivotal role in a wide variety of fields but faces challenges related to privacy concerns. Recently, synthesizing data via diffusion models is viewed as a promising solution. However, existing methods still struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and complex channel interrelations. In this research, we aim to utilize the sequence modeling capability of a State Space Model called Mamba to extend its applicability to time series data generation. We firstly analyze the core limitations in State Space Model, namely the lack of consideration for correlated temporal lag and channel permutation. Building upon the insight, we propose Lag Fusion Mamba and Permutation Scanning Mamba, which enhance the model's ability to discern significant patterns during the denoising process. Theoretical analysis reveals that both variants exhibit a unified matrix multiplication framework with the original Mamba, offering a deeper understanding of our method. Finally, we integrate two variants and introduce Diffusion Mamba for Time Series (DiM-TS), a high-quality time series generation model that better preserves the temporal periodicity and inter-channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of DiM-TS in generating realistic time series while preserving diverse properties of data.

*Nikita Neveditsin,Pawan Lingras,Vijay Mago*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel scalable spectral method for estimating the number of clusters in short text embeddings and introduces the Cohesion Ratio, an evaluation metric for cluster quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in clustering short text embeddings arise due to difficulties in pre-specifying the number of clusters and evaluating clusters without ground-truth labels.

Method: A spectral method using cosine similarities, adaptive sampling strategy for estimating cluster count, and the Cohesion Ratio metric inspired by mutual information for evaluating cluster quality.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that standard clustering algorithms guided by the proposed method outperform popular methods, confirming its reliability and practicality.

Conclusion: The spectral estimator and Cohesion Ratio metric provide effective solutions for unsupervised clustering and evaluation of short text data, with scalable and reliable methodologies.

Abstract: Clustering short text embeddings is a foundational task in natural language processing, yet remains challenging due to the need to specify the number of clusters in advance. We introduce a scalable spectral method that estimates the number of clusters directly from the structure of the Laplacian eigenspectrum, constructed using cosine similarities and guided by an adaptive sampling strategy. This sampling approach enables our estimator to efficiently scale to large datasets without sacrificing reliability. To support intrinsic evaluation of cluster quality without ground-truth labels, we propose the Cohesion Ratio, a simple and interpretable evaluation metric that quantifies how much intra-cluster similarity exceeds the global similarity background. It has an information-theoretic motivation inspired by mutual information, and in our experiments it correlates closely with extrinsic measures such as normalized mutual information and homogeneity. Extensive experiments on six short-text datasets and four modern embedding models show that standard algorithms like K-Means and HAC, when guided by our estimator, significantly outperform popular parameter-light methods such as HDBSCAN, OPTICS, and Leiden. These results demonstrate the practical value of our spectral estimator and Cohesion Ratio for unsupervised organization and evaluation of short text data. Implementation of our estimator of k and Cohesion Ratio, along with code for reproducing the experiments, is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/towards_clustering-0C2E.

*Yuting Gao,Wang Lan,Hengyuan Zhao,Linjiang Huang,Si Liu,Qingpei Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AnyExperts, a budget-aware dynamic routing framework for multimodal mixture-of-experts models, reducing compute cost while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE models inefficiently allocate equal computational resources to all tokens regardless of their semantic importance, leading to resource wastage.

Method: AnyExperts uses a dynamic routing system that allocates varying expert slots per token based on semantic importance, capped by a compute budget with a mix of real and virtual experts.

Result: The approach achieves equal or better task performance with significantly fewer real expert activations across visual, audio, and NLP domains, enhancing efficiency.

Conclusion: The study showcases a method for dynamic expert allocation that optimizes computational resources while maintaining high task performance across various modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer a promising path toward scalable and efficient large vision-language systems. However, existing approaches rely on rigid routing strategies (typically activating a fixed number of experts per token) ignoring the inherent heterogeneity in semantic importance across modalities. This leads to suboptimal compute allocation, where redundant tokens consume as many resources as critical ones. To address this, we propose AnyExperts, a novel on-demand, budget-aware dynamic routing framework that allocates a variable total number of expert slots per token based on its semantic importance. Crucially, to prevent uncontrolled compute growth, the total slots per token are constrained within a fixed range, and each slot is filled by either a real expert or a virtual expert, with the virtual share capped at a small maximum (e.g., 20%). The model then adaptively balances the real-to-virtual ratio per token, assigning more real experts to semantically rich regions and relying more on virtual experts for redundant content. Evaluated across diverse tasks in visual understanding, audio understanding, and NLP understanding, AnyExperts improves performance under the same compute budget. Notably, on general image/video tasks, it achieves comparable accuracy with 40% fewer real expert activations; on text-dense tasks (OCR and NLP), it maintains performance while reducing real expert usage by 10%. These results demonstrate that fine-grained, importance-driven expert allocation significantly enhances both the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal MoE models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a clinician-in-the-loop smart home system using ML and ambient sensor data to detect urinary tract infection (UTI) flare-ups with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting UTI flare-ups in older adults earlier and improve clinical decision-making by providing actionable information with confidence levels.

Method: The system uses a novel machine learning approach with Conformal-Calibrated Interval (CCI) for uncertainty, abstaining from predictions when confidence is low, and employs ambient sensors and behavioral markers.

Result: The system demonstrated strong performance on real-world data, improving recall and other metrics with minimal abstention, and was validated by nurse surveys for its practical clinical utility.

Conclusion: The presented system enhances UTI management by combining advanced ML models with uncertainty awareness, offering a practical tool for informed and effective clinical decision-making in older adults.

Abstract: Urinary tract infection (UTI) flare-ups pose a significant health risk for older adults with chronic conditions. These infections often go unnoticed until they become severe, making early detection through innovative smart home technologies crucial. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches relying on simple binary classification for UTI detection offer limited utility to nurses and practitioners as they lack insight into prediction uncertainty, hindering informed clinical decision-making. This paper presents a clinician-in-the-loop (CIL) smart home system that leverages ambient sensor data to extract meaningful behavioral markers, train robust predictive ML models, and calibrate them to enable uncertainty-aware decision support. The system incorporates a statistically valid uncertainty quantification method called Conformal-Calibrated Interval (CCI), which quantifies uncertainty and abstains from making predictions ("I don't know") when the ML model's confidence is low. Evaluated on real-world data from eight smart homes, our method outperforms baseline methods in recall and other classification metrics while maintaining the lowest abstention proportion and interval width. A survey of 42 nurses confirms that our system's outputs are valuable for guiding clinical decision-making, underscoring their practical utility in improving informed decisions and effectively managing UTIs and other condition flare-ups in older adults.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Auxiliary Gene Learning (AGL) and a gene selection method (DkGSB) to improve spatial transcriptomics analysis using all genes, including low-expression ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the neglect of low-expression genes in spatial transcriptomics analysis due to observational noise and optimize gene selection for better estimation.

Method: Proposes Auxiliary Gene Learning (AGL) combined with Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-k Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB) to utilize ignored genes and optimize their selection.

Result: Experimental results show improved prediction accuracy when auxiliary genes are included, and the proposed method outperforms existing techniques.

Conclusion: Incorporating auxiliary genes and optimizing their selection enhances spatial transcriptomics analysis significantly, addressing limitations in conventional approaches.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a novel technology that enables the observation of gene expression at the resolution of individual spots within pathological tissues. ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \ Gene \ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.

Motivation: To examine the variability in LLMs’ forecasting performance and understand how context, question structure, and external knowledge influence their accuracy and calibration.

Method: The study investigates multiple LLMs on real-world questions beyond their knowledge cutoff date. It examines factors such as question type, input context, and factual news integration to analyze performance.

Result: The paper finds that LLMs’ forecasting accuracy is highly variable and dependent on the type of question asked and the contextual framing provided.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit partial forecasting competence, and their performance heavily depends on the manner in which prompts are designed and external context is incorporated.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate partial forecasting competence across social, political, and economic events. Yet, their predictive ability varies sharply with domain structure and prompt framing. We investigate how forecasting performance varies with different model families on real-world questions about events that happened beyond the model cutoff date. We analyze how context, question type, and external knowledge affect accuracy and calibration, and how adding factual news context modifies belief formation and failure modes. Our results show that forecasting ability is highly variable as it depends on what, and how, we ask.

TL;DR: This paper proposes MVCIB, a framework for pre-training graph neural networks on 2D and 3D molecular structures by addressing shared and view-specific information and substructure alignment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-view molecular learning by addressing challenges of shared information discovery and substructure alignment between 2D and 3D molecular graphs.

Method: Introduces Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck (MVCIB) framework, which uses shared information under contextual conditions and employs cross-attention to align substructures between views.

Result: MVCIB outperformed benchmarks in predictive performance and interpretability across four molecular domains, and achieved the 3d Weisfeiler-Lehman expressiveness to distinguish molecular structures effectively.

Conclusion: MVCIB enhances cross-view consistency and model expressiveness for molecular graph learning, particularly in distinguishing complex molecular variations through substructure alignment.

Abstract: Recent pre-training strategies for molecular graphs have attempted to use 2D and 3D molecular views as both inputs and self-supervised signals, primarily aligning graph-level representations. However, existing studies remain limited in addressing two main challenges of multi-view molecular learning: (1) discovering shared information between two views while diminishing view-specific information and (2) identifying and aligning important substructures, e.g., functional groups, which are crucial for enhancing cross-view consistency and model expressiveness. To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck framework, called MVCIB, for pre-training graph neural networks on 2D and 3D molecular structures in a self-supervised setting. Our idea is to discover the shared information while minimizing irrelevant features from each view under the MVCIB principle, which uses one view as a contextual condition to guide the representation learning of its counterpart. To enhance semantic and structural consistency across views, we utilize key substructures, e.g., functional groups and ego-networks, as anchors between the two views. Then, we propose a cross-attention mechanism that captures fine-grained correlations between the substructures to achieve subgraph alignment across views. Extensive experiments in four molecular domains demonstrated that MVCIB consistently outperforms baselines in both predictive performance and interpretability. Moreover, MVCIB achieved the 3d Weisfeiler-Lehman expressiveness power to distinguish not only non-isomorphic graphs but also different 3D geometries that share identical 2D connectivity, such as isomers.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a scalable, clinically interpretable AI pipeline that can reduce radiographic imaging requirements while maintaining diagnostic efficacy, contributing to safer pediatric imaging practices.

Abstract: We study an ultrasound-first, radiation-preserving policy for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) that requests a radiograph only when needed.
  We (i) pretrain modality-specific encoders (ResNet-18) with SimSiam on a large unlabelled registry (37186 ultrasound; 19546 radiographs), (ii) freeze the backbones and fit small, measurement-faithful heads on DDH relevant landmarks and measurements (iii) calibrate a one sided conformal deferral rule on ultrasound predictions that provides finite sample coverage guarantees under exchangeability, using a held-out calibration set. Ultrasound heads predict Graf alpha, beta, and femoral head coverage; X-ray heads predict acetabular index (AI), center-edge (CE) angle and IHDI grade. On our held out labeled evaluation set, ultrasound measurement error is modest (e.g., alpha MAE ~= 9.7 degrees, coverage MAE ~= 14.0%), while radiographic probes achieve AI and CE MAEs of ~= 7.6 degrees and ~= 8.9 degrees, respectively. The calibrated US-only policy is explored across rule families (alpha-only; alpha OR coverage; alpha AND coverage), uncertainty inflation factors, and per-utility trade-offs using decision-curve analysis. Conservative settings yield high coverage with near-zero US-only rates; permissive settings (e.g., alpha OR coverage at larger deltas) achieve non-zero US-only throughput with expected coverage tradeoffs. The result is a simple, reproducible pipeline that turns limited labels into interpretable measurements and tunable selective imaging curves suitable for clinical handoff and future external validation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors propose SloMo-Fast, a source-free, dual-teacher framework for continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) aimed at maintaining adaptability and generalization across evolving domains without relying on source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of deploying models in evolving unseen domains while avoiding reliance on source data due to privacy and resource constraints.

Method: SloMo-Fast employs a dual-teacher approach: Slow-Teacher retains long-term knowledge for robust generalization, and Fast-Teacher adapts quickly to new domains while integrating cross-domain knowledge.

Result: Experiments show SloMo-Fast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Cyclic-TTA and ten additional CTTA settings, proving its ability to adapt to evolving and recurring domains.

Conclusion: The proposed SloMo-Fast framework effectively balances adaptability and generalization, offering a robust solution for dynamic domain adaptation without source dependencies.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is crucial for deploying models in real-world applications with unseen, evolving target domains. Existing CTTA methods, however, often rely on source data or prototypes, limiting their applicability in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings. Additionally, these methods suffer from long-term forgetting, which degrades performance on previously encountered domains as target domains shift. To address these challenges, we propose SloMo-Fast, a source-free, dual-teacher CTTA framework designed for enhanced adaptability and generalization. It includes two complementary teachers: the Slow-Teacher, which exhibits slow forgetting and retains long-term knowledge of previously encountered domains to ensure robust generalization, and the Fast-Teacher rapidly adapts to new domains while accumulating and integrating knowledge across them. This framework preserves knowledge of past domains and adapts efficiently to new ones. We also introduce Cyclic Test-Time Adaptation (Cyclic-TTA), a novel CTTA benchmark that simulates recurring domain shifts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SloMo-Fast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Cyclic-TTA, as well as ten other CTTA settings, highlighting its ability to both adapt and generalize across evolving and revisited domains.

*Winfried van den Dool,Maksim Zhdanov,Yuki M. Asano,Max Welling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Mesh Quantization for neural PDE solvers, enabling dynamic bit-width allocation to improve efficiency and performance across spatially varying complexities in computational grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the inefficiency of neural PDE solvers that apply uniform computational effort across all mesh nodes, regardless of the varying complexity in physical systems, leading to wasted computational resources.

Method: The authors propose Adaptive Mesh Quantization, which dynamically adjusts bit-width allocation based on spatial complexity, using a lightweight auxiliary model to identify high-loss regions and redistribute computational resources effectively.

Result: When integrated with state-of-the-art models (MP-PDE and GraphViT), the proposed framework demonstrated up to 50% performance improvements on various complex tasks, such as 2D Darcy flow, unsteady fluid dynamics, and Navier-Stokes simulations.

Conclusion: Adaptive Mesh Quantization offers an efficient resource utilization approach, significantly improving the performance of neural PDE solvers while maintaining computational cost, especially in scenarios with varying spatial complexities.

Abstract: Physical systems commonly exhibit spatially varying complexity, presenting a significant challenge for neural PDE solvers. While Graph Neural Networks can handle the irregular meshes required for complex geometries and boundary conditions, they still apply uniform computational effort across all nodes regardless of the underlying physics complexity. This leads to inefficient resource allocation where computationally simple regions receive the same treatment as complex phenomena. We address this challenge by introducing Adaptive Mesh Quantization: spatially adaptive quantization across mesh node, edge, and cluster features, dynamically adjusting the bit-width used by a quantized model. We propose an adaptive bit-width allocation strategy driven by a lightweight auxiliary model that identifies high-loss regions in the input mesh. This enables dynamic resource distribution in the main model, where regions of higher difficulty are allocated increased bit-width, optimizing computational resource utilization. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness by integrating it with two state-of-the-art models, MP-PDE and GraphViT, to evaluate performance across multiple tasks: 2D Darcy flow, large-scale unsteady fluid dynamics in 2D, steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations in 3D, and a 2D hyper-elasticity problem. Our framework demonstrates consistent Pareto improvements over uniformly quantized baselines, yielding up to 50% improvements in performance at the same cost.

### [620] [RRaPINNs: Residual Risk-Aware Physics Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18515)
*Ange-Clément Akazan,Issa Karambal,Jean Medard Ngnotchouye,Abebe Geletu Selassie. W*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Residual Risk-Aware Physics-Informed Neural Networks (RRaPINNs) optimize tail-focused objectives and reduce worst-case errors while maintaining accuracy in physics-informed neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs often focus on minimizing average residuals, which can lead to localized large errors and hinder reliability in solving PDEs.

Method: RRaPINNs introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) and Mean-Excess (ME) penalty to control tail residuals and reformulate PINN training as risk-sensitive optimization.

Result: RRaPINNs demonstrate reduced tail residuals and comparable or improved mean errors across several PDEs, outperforming other variants like vanilla PINNs and residual-based attention.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances reliability for smooth and discontinuous PDEs but has limitations like global-only tail budgeting and memoryless sampling; these are addressed with practical remedies like local risk budgets or multi-objective approaches.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) typically minimize average residuals, which can conceal large, localized errors. We propose Residual Risk-Aware Physics-Informed Neural Networks PINNs (RRaPINNs), a single-network framework that optimizes tail-focused objectives using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), we also introduced a Mean-Excess (ME) surrogate penalty to directly control worst-case PDE residuals. This casts PINN training as risk-sensitive optimization and links it to chance-constrained formulations. The method is effective and simple to implement. Across several partial differential equations (PDEs) such as Burgers, Heat, Korteweg-de-Vries, and Poisson (including a Poisson interface problem with a source jump at x=0.5) equations, RRaPINNs reduce tail residuals while maintaining or improving mean errors compared to vanilla PINNs, Residual-Based Attention and its variant using convolution weighting; the ME surrogate yields smoother optimization than a direct CVaR hinge. The chance constraint reliability level $α$ acts as a transparent knob trading bulk accuracy (lower $α$ ) for stricter tail control (higher $α$ ). We discuss the framework limitations, including memoryless sampling, global-only tail budgeting, and residual-centric risk, and outline remedies via persistent hard-point replay, local risk budgets, and multi-objective risk over BC/IC terms. RRaPINNs offer a practical path to reliability-aware scientific ML for both smooth and discontinuous PDEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CHIPS, a method for selecting data effectively during continual pre-training for domain adaptation, focusing on smaller datasets to achieve high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore if effective data selection can replace the need for large-scale datasets for continual pre-training in adapting CLIP to vertical domains.

Method: The authors propose CHIPS, a utility scoring system integrating three factors: faithfulness via CLIP's end-point subspace alignment, scalability using Johnson-Lindenstrauss sketching, and retention with relevance-weighted learning approaches.

Result: Empirical evaluation showed CHIPS achieving state-of-the-art performance in data selection, matching full-dataset continual pre-training with only 30% data, and outperforming larger dataset settings in lower retention budgets.

Conclusion: Effective data-centric selection via CHIPS can lead to high domain adaptation performance, reducing the need for large-scale datasets while maintaining strong results.

Abstract: Adapting CLIP to vertical domains is typically approached by novel fine-tuning strategies or by continual pre-training (CPT) on large domain-specific datasets. Yet, data itself remains an underexplored factor in this process. We revisit this task from a data-centric perspective: Can effective data selection substitute for large-scale datasets in CPT? We introduce CHIPS (Curvature-aware Hybrid Influence in Projection Subspace), which assigns each image-text pair a utility score that integrates three complementary factors aligned with three goals: faithfulness via a curvature-aware, Newton-style alignment computed in CLIP's end-point subspace; scalability via an InfoNCE-aware curvature estimator with Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) sketching; and retention via a selection-aware relevance weight combined with learnability to balance target adaptation against general-domain preservation. We justify this design theoretically by proving a lower-bound guarantee on the proxy's correlation with full-parameter alignment and by characterizing the bias-variance trade-offs introduced by curvature mixing and JL sketching. We evaluate CHIPS empirically across various settings: 1) CHIPS attains state-of-the-art performance among selection baselines on 17 medical benchmarks, matches full-dataset CPT with 30% of the data, and outperforms half-dataset CPT using only 10%; 2) on 31 general-domain benchmarks, CHIPS yields the smallest performance drop under 10-30% data-retention budgets. Code, data, and checkpoints will be released.

### [622] [Hyperspectral Variational Autoencoders for Joint Data Compression and Component Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18521)
*Core Francisco Park,Manuel Perez-Carrasco,Caroline Nowlan,Cecilia Garraffo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a variational autoencoder (VAE) that compresses geostationary satellite hyperspectral data by 514x while maintaining high spectral fidelity and explores the compressed data's capacity for atmospheric information extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapidly generated huge datasets from geostationary hyperspectral satellites pose challenges in storage, transmission, and scientific distribution, necessitating effective data compression methods.

Method: A VAE model is used to compress NASA's TEMPO hyperspectral observation data. Probes are trained on the latent space to evaluate how much atmospheric information (e.g., NO2, O3, HCHO) is retained, with both linear and nonlinear techniques tested.

Result: The VAE achieves x514 compression with minimal reconstruction errors. Atmospheric products like cloud fraction and ozone retain high accuracy, while others like NO2 and HCHO face challenges. Nonlinear probes generally outperform linear ones, and explicit latent supervision barely enhances encoding.

Conclusion: Neural compression via VAE effectively reduces hyperspectral data sizes while retaining key signals, but inherent challenges persist for extracting complex atmospheric products. This approach addresses data bottlenecks for advanced Earth observation systems.

Abstract: Geostationary hyperspectral satellites generate terabytes of data daily, creating critical challenges for storage, transmission, and distribution to the scientific community. We present a variational autoencoder (VAE) approach that achieves x514 compression of NASA's TEMPO satellite hyperspectral observations (1028 channels, 290-490nm) with reconstruction errors 1-2 orders of magnitude below the signal across all wavelengths. This dramatic data volume reduction enables efficient archival and sharing of satellite observations while preserving spectral fidelity. Beyond compression, we investigate to what extent atmospheric information is retained in the compressed latent space by training linear and nonlinear probes to extract Level-2 products (NO2, O3, HCHO, cloud fraction). Cloud fraction and total ozone achieve strong extraction performance (R^2 = 0.93 and 0.81 respectively), though these represent relatively straightforward retrievals given their distinct spectral signatures. In contrast, tropospheric trace gases pose genuine challenges for extraction (NO2 R^2 = 0.20, HCHO R^2 = 0.51) reflecting their weaker signals and complex atmospheric interactions. Critically, we find the VAE encodes atmospheric information in a semi-linear manner - nonlinear probes substantially outperform linear ones - and that explicit latent supervision during training provides minimal improvement, revealing fundamental encoding challenges for certain products. This work demonstrates that neural compression can dramatically reduce hyperspectral data volumes while preserving key atmospheric signals, addressing a critical bottleneck for next-generation Earth observation systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel time-series forecasting framework, TimePre, that combines MLP efficiency and MCL flexibility, overcoming training instabilities with Stabilized Instance Normalization (SIN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies and instabilities in current probabilistic time-series forecasting models, particularly in combining MLP-based backbones with Multiple Choice Learning (MCL).

Method: The authors propose TimePre, which integrates Stabilized Instance Normalization (SIN) to stabilize hybrid architectures by correcting channel-wise statistical shifts, alleviating hypothesis collapse.

Result: TimePre achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on six benchmark datasets and enhances speed significantly compared to sampling-based models, with stable scaling in performance.

Conclusion: TimePre bridges the gaps of accuracy, efficiency, and stability in probabilistic forecasting, offering a transformative approach for uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Abstract: Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting (PTSF) is critical for uncertainty-aware decision making, but existing generative models, such as diffusion-based approaches, are computationally prohibitive due to expensive iterative sampling. Non-sampling frameworks like Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) offer an efficient alternative, but suffer from severe training instability and hypothesis collapse, which has historically hindered their performance. This problem is dramatically exacerbated when attempting to combine them with modern, efficient MLP-based backbones. To resolve this fundamental incompatibility, we propose TimePre, a novel framework that successfully unifies the efficiency of MLP-based models with the distributional flexibility of the MCL paradigm. The core of our solution is Stabilized Instance Normalization (SIN), a novel normalization layer that explicitly remedies this incompatibility. SIN stabilizes the hybrid architecture by correcting channel-wise statistical shifts, definitively resolving the catastrophic hypothesis collapse. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimePre achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on key probabilistic metrics. Critically, TimePre achieves inference speeds orders of magnitude faster than sampling-based models and, unlike prior MCL work, demonstrates stable performance scaling. It thus bridges the long-standing gap between accuracy, efficiency, and stability in probabilistic forecasting.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 21 goodness functions for the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm, showcasing alternatives to the default sum-of-squares to enhance accuracy and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the default sum-of-squares goodness function in the FF algorithm is optimal and to explore alternatives that could improve accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: Benchmarked 21 goodness functions on image datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10) and compared their performance in terms of accuracy, energy consumption, and carbon footprint.

Result: Alternative goodness functions, such as `game_theoretic_local`, `softmax_energy_margin_local`, and `triplet_margin_local`, surpassed the baseline sum-of-squares in accuracy on specific datasets while emphasizing computational trade-offs.

Conclusion: Choosing an optimal goodness function is crucial for FF algorithm effectiveness, with results showing significant trade-offs between predictive accuracy and environmental impact. Open-source code is provided.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation, enabling neural networks to learn through local updates. However, FF's efficacy relies heavily on the definition of "goodness", which is a scalar measure of neural activity. While current implementations predominantly utilize a simple sum-of-squares metric, it remains unclear if this default choice is optimal. To address this, we benchmarked 21 distinct goodness functions across four standard image datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10), evaluating classification accuracy, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. We found that certain alternative goodness functions inspired from various domains significantly outperform the standard baseline. Specifically, \texttt{game\_theoretic\_local} achieved 97.15\% accuracy on MNIST, \texttt{softmax\_energy\_margin\_local} reached 82.84\% on FashionMNIST, and \texttt{triplet\_margin\_local} attained 37.69\% on STL-10. Furthermore, we observed substantial variability in computational efficiency, highlighting a critical trade-off between predictive performance and environmental cost. These findings demonstrate that the goodness function is a pivotal hyperparameter in FF design. We release our code on \href{https://github.com/aryashah2k/In-Search-of-Goodness}{Github} for reference and reproducibility.

*Jiazhen Hong,Geoffrey Mackellar,Soheila Ghane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAMBA is a self-supervised framework using a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture tailored for EEG data modeling, addressing challenges in scalability and generalizability across devices, achieving superior performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to enable effective representation of long-sequence EEG data due to high sampling rates and extended durations required for neurological pattern recognition, while addressing challenges like variable electrode setups and inter-subject variability.

Method: SAMBA leverages Mamba-based architecture along with novel techniques like Temporal Semantic Random Masking, Multi-Head Differential Mamba for redundancy suppression, and Spatial-Adaptive Input Embedding for robust EEG data handling.

Result: Experiments on thirteen diverse EEG datasets show SAMBA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, while providing neurophysiologically interpretable spatial weight maps.

Conclusion: SAMBA proves scalable and efficient for EEG modeling, setting the stage for real-time brain-computer interface applications with robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Long-sequence electroencephalogram (EEG) modeling is essential for developing generalizable EEG representation models. This need arises from the high sampling rate of EEG data and the long recording durations required to capture extended neurological patterns in brain activity. Transformer-based models have shown promise in modeling short sequences of a few seconds; however, their quadratic complexity limits scalability to longer contexts. Moreover, variability in electrode montage across available datasets, along with inter-subject differences in brain signals, pose significant challenges to developing a generalizable and robust foundation model. We propose \textit{SAMBA}, a self-supervised learning framework with a Mamba-based U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture, which effectively captures long-range temporal dependencies and spatial variability in EEG data. Leveraging the inherent ability of Mamba in processing long context sizes, we introduce: (1) \textit{Temporal Semantic Random Masking} for semantic-level sequence reconstruction, (2) a \textit{Multi-Head Differential Mamba} module to suppress redundancy and emphasize salient temporal structures, and (3) a \textit{Spatial-Adaptive Input Embedding} that learns unified embeddings in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, enabling robustness across devices. Experiments on thirteen EEG datasets across diverse tasks, electrode configurations, and sequence durations demonstrate that SAMBA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low memory consumption and inference time. We also show the learned spatial weight maps from our embedding module align closely with task-relevant neurophysiological regions, demonstrating the learnability and interpretability of SAMBA. These results highlight SAMBA's scalability and practical potential as a foundation model for real-time brain-computer interface applications.

### [626] [Generative Myopia: Why Diffusion Models Fail at Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18593)
*Milad Siami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Standard Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs) favor common substructures over rare but essential ones, failing in tasks like graph sparsification. The authors propose Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion to overcome this generative bias, ensuring structural integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDMs struggle with capturing rare yet critical graph structures due to their statistical likelihood optimization, leading to failures in vital combinatorial tasks, such as retaining key connections.

Method: Introduce Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion, leveraging Effective Resistance as a spectral prior in the training phase to re-align optimization, ensuring retention of rare but mandatory edges.

Result: The proposed method achieves consistently better performance, ensuring 100% connectivity in adversarial benchmarks where conventional GDMs fail entirely (0% connectivity).

Conclusion: Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion successfully mitigates Generative Myopia and Gradient Starvation, enabling GDMs to reliably capture essential graph structures without computational overhead at inference.

Abstract: Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs) optimize for statistical likelihood, implicitly acting as \textbf{frequency filters} that favor abundant substructures over spectrally critical ones. We term this phenomenon \textbf{Generative Myopia}. In combinatorial tasks like graph sparsification, this leads to the catastrophic removal of ``rare bridges,'' edges that are structurally mandatory ($R_{\text{eff}} \approx 1$) but statistically scarce. We prove theoretically and empirically that this failure is driven by \textbf{Gradient Starvation}: the optimization landscape itself suppresses rare structural signals, rendering them unlearnable regardless of model capacity. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion}, which re-aligns the variational objective using Effective Resistance. We demonstrate that spectral priors can be amortized into the training phase with zero inference overhead. Our method eliminates myopia, matching the performance of an optimal Spectral Oracle and achieving \textbf{100\% connectivity} on adversarial benchmarks where standard diffusion fails completely (0\%).

Motivation: To explore the trade-offs between predictive accuracy and interpretability in forecasting non-deterministic stock prices using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

Method: Compared predictive performance between Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks using RMSE across different prediction horizons.

Result: LSTM exhibited significantly lower error rates across all tested cases, highlighting their predictive accuracy. KANs showed higher error rates but were more computationally efficient.

Conclusion: LSTM is recommended for accuracy-critical financial forecasting, while KANs may be suitable for scenarios with resource constraints or where interpretability is prioritized.

Abstract: This paper compares Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) for forecasting non-deterministic stock price data, evaluating predictive accuracy versus interpretability trade-offs using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).LSTM demonstrates substantial superiority across all tested prediction horizons, confirming their established effectiveness for sequential data modelling. Standard KAN, while offering theoretical interpretability through the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, exhibits significantly higher error rates and limited practical applicability for time series forecasting. The results confirm LSTM dominance in accuracy-critical time series applications while identifying computational efficiency as KANs' primary advantage in resource-constrained scenarios where accuracy requirements are less stringent. The findings support LSTM adoption for practical financial forecasting while suggesting that continued research into specialised KAN architectures may yield future improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting the formation of new interdisciplinary research fields is challenging but critical for scientific advancement.

Method: The authors developed FOS, a time-aware graph-based model, enriched with semantic and temporal descriptors, to predict first-time connections between research sub-fields as a temporal link-prediction task.

Result: Experiments show embedding detailed field descriptions improves accuracy, and different models excel under varying conditions. Predictions align with actual emerging field pairings observed in later academic publications.

Conclusion: FOS provides a reproducible benchmark to advance research in forecasting scientific developments. The results demonstrate the tool's potential in predicting scientific frontiers.

Abstract: Interdisciplinary scientific breakthroughs mostly emerge unexpectedly, and forecasting the formation of novel research fields remains a major challenge. We introduce FOS (Future Of Science), a comprehensive time-aware graph-based benchmark that reconstructs annual co-occurrence graphs of 65,027 research sub-fields (spanning 19 general domains) over the period 1827-2024. In these graphs, edges denote the co-occurrence of two fields in a single publication and are timestamped with the corresponding publication year. Nodes are enriched with semantic embeddings, and edges are characterized by temporal and topological descriptors. We formulate the prediction of new field-pair linkages as a temporal link-prediction task, emphasizing the "first-time" connections that signify pioneering interdisciplinary directions. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art temporal graph architectures under multiple negative-sampling regimes and show that (i) embedding long-form textual descriptions of fields significantly boosts prediction accuracy, and (ii) distinct model classes excel under different evaluation settings. Case analyses show that top-ranked link predictions on FOS align with field pairings that emerge in subsequent years of academic publications. We publicly release FOS, along with its temporal data splits and evaluation code, to establish a reproducible benchmark for advancing research in predicting scientific frontiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a privacy-respecting AI solution for clinical anamnesis by addressing the computational and data security challenges of cloud-based systems, enabling local deployment in low-cost healthcare environments.

Method: The framework incorporates a fine-tuned LLM chatbot trained on real and synthetic medical dialogues using Low-Rank Adaptation for efficiency. It also includes an avatar powered by a conditional diffusion model trained on latent space video datasets and synchronized with audio for realistic interaction.

Result: Stable fine-tuning and generalization were achieved through optimized training of autoencoder and diffusion networks. MedChat demonstrated strong performance in preserving privacy, resource efficiency, and adaptability to unseen clinical data.

Conclusion: MedChat provides a viable, secure, and offline-deployable solution for AI-assisted clinical anamnesis, making it suitable for both high and low-cost healthcare settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models made it possible to achieve high conversational performance with substantially reduced computational demands, enabling practical on-site deployment in clinical environments. Such progress allows for local integration of AI systems that uphold strict data protection and patient privacy requirements, yet their secure implementation in medicine necessitates careful consideration of ethical, regulatory, and technical constraints.
  In this study, we introduce MedChat, a locally deployable virtual physician framework that integrates an LLM-based medical chatbot with a diffusion-driven avatar for automated and structured anamnesis. The chatbot was fine-tuned using a hybrid corpus of real and synthetically generated medical dialogues, while model efficiency was optimized via Low-Rank Adaptation. A secure and isolated database interface was implemented to ensure complete separation between patient data and the inference process. The avatar component was realized through a conditional diffusion model operating in latent space, trained on researcher video datasets and synchronized with mel-frequency audio features for realistic speech and facial animation.
  Unlike existing cloud-based systems, this work demonstrates the feasibility of a fully offline, locally deployable LLM-diffusion framework for clinical anamnesis. The autoencoder and diffusion networks exhibited smooth convergence, and MedChat achieved stable fine-tuning with strong generalization to unseen data. The proposed system thus provides a privacy-preserving, resource-efficient foundation for AI-assisted clinical anamnesis, also in low-cost settings.

TL;DR: Kitty introduces mixed-precision KV caching to significantly cut memory usage for large language model (LLM) inference while maintaining near-zero accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the memory bottleneck in LLM inference caused by KV caching, especially when aiming for higher compression (e.g., 2-bit) without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Kitty employs an algorithm-system co-design: channel-wise precision adjustment dynamically ranks Key-cache channels by sensitivity, boosting key channels while maintaining uniform page layouts for efficient Triton-compatible dequantization.

Result: Kitty achieves nearly 8x reduction in KV memory usage with negligible impact on accuracy across various tasks and models, enabling 8x larger batch sizes and up to 4.1x higher throughput.

Conclusion: Kitty provides an innovative solution to optimize memory usage in long-context reasoning for LLMs, facilitating better performance within constrained memory environments.

Abstract: The KV cache is a dominant memory bottleneck for LLM inference. While 4-bit KV quantization preserves accuracy, 2-bit often degrades it, especially on long-context reasoning. We close this gap via an algorithm-system co-design for mixed-precision KV caching: Kitty. On the algorithm side, extensive experiments show that Dynamic Channel-wise Precision Boost -- which ranks Key-cache channels by sensitivity and keeps only a small fraction at higher precision -- maintains near-zero loss in accuracy drop while approaching 2-bit memory. The main challenge is handling dynamic 4-bit channel boosts while keeping the page layout coalesced and the dequantization uniform, with no scattered reads or hard-coded masks. Kitty addresses these issues by decompose each mixed-precision Key page into two tensors with unified 2-bit precision. Based on this, Kitty provides a page-centric KV layout, Triton-compatible page dequantization kernels, and a lightweight runtime pipeline that preserves coalescing and avoids divergence. Across seven tasks and two model families (Qwen3, LLaMA3), Kitty cuts KV memory by nearly 8x with negligible accuracy loss, enabling up to 8x larger batches and 2.1x-4.1x higher throughput under the same memory budget. We release the full implementation of Kitty at https://github.com/Summer-Summer/Kitty.

*Rowan Bradbury,Aniket Srinivasan Ashok,Sai Ram Kasanagottu,Gunmay Jhingran,Shuai Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of replacing modules (like self-attention) in pretrained models by introducing Deterministic Continuous Replacement (DCR), a method to improve stability and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve optimization issues when replacing components (e.g., self-attention) in pretrained models, as cold-start reinitialization can destabilize frozen backbones.

Method: The paper proposes Deterministic Continuous Replacement (DCR), which blends teacher–student outputs using a deterministic, annealed weight to mitigate gradient variability during module replacement.

Result: DCR achieves faster convergence and better alignment compared to stochastic gating and distillation baselines in controlled attention replacement examples.

Conclusion: DCR could provide a stable foundation for heterogeneous operator replacements in pretrained models, overcoming stability challenges associated with module swaps.

Abstract: Replacing modules in pretrained models, especially swapping quadratic self-attention for efficient attention alternatives, poses a hard optimization problem: cold-start reinitialization destabilizes frozen backbones. We isolate this core stability challenge in a controlled study. Deterministic Continuous Replacement (DCR) blends teacher and student outputs with a deterministic, annealed weight. Theoretically, DCR eliminates gate-induced gradient variance inherent to stochastic replacement. In a single-seed study, DCR attains faster convergence and stronger alignment than stochastic gating and distillation baselines on controlled attention replacement, establishing a foundation for heterogeneous operator swaps.

*Yan Wang,Ke Deng,Yongli Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the centralized-decentralized mismatch in multi-agent reinforcement learning and proposes the MCEM framework to improve learning efficiency and agent cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of centralized-decentralized mismatch in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, which degrades agents' learning due to suboptimal behaviors impacting others.

Method: The authors propose the Multi-Agent Cross-Entropy Method (MCEM) combined with monotonic nonlinear critic decomposition (NCD), updating policies to exclude suboptimal joint actions and extending off-policy learning with modified k-step return and Retrace.

Result: Experiments show that MCEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both continuous and discrete action benchmarks, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and better cooperation.

Conclusion: MCEM alleviates the centralized-decentralized mismatch, enhances representation, and significantly improves multi-agent reinforcement learning effectiveness, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE), where centralized critics leverage global information to guide decentralized actors. However, centralized-decentralized mismatch (CDM) arises when the suboptimal behavior of one agent degrades others' learning. Prior approaches mitigate CDM through value decomposition, but linear decompositions allow per-agent gradients at the cost of limited expressiveness, while nonlinear decompositions improve representation but require centralized gradients, reintroducing CDM. To overcome this trade-off, we propose the multi-agent cross-entropy method (MCEM), combined with monotonic nonlinear critic decomposition (NCD). MCEM updates policies by increasing the probability of high-value joint actions, thereby excluding suboptimal behaviors. For sample efficiency, we extend off-policy learning with a modified k-step return and Retrace. Analysis and experiments demonstrate that MCEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both continuous and discrete action benchmarks.

*Kazi Ahmed Asif Fuad,Lizhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces QuantKAN, a framework for quantizing Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) in both training and post-training settings, utilizing spline-based architectures and establishing benchmarks for low-bit configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of efficient quantization methods tailored for Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), which, despite their strong expressivity, face challenges due to heterogeneous parameters in spline-based components.

Method: The authors extend modern quantization algorithms to accommodate spline-based architectures in KANs, integrating branch-specific quantizers for different network components and validating across various KAN variants.

Result: The experiments demonstrate the compatibility of KANs with low-bit quantization, highlighting algorithm-architecture interactions and identifying preferred quantization methods under varied conditions.

Conclusion: QuantKAN successfully unifies spline learning and quantization, offering benchmarks and guidelines for deploying KANs in resource-constrained scenarios, showcasing their adaptability to efficient low-bit operations.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) represent a new class of neural architectures that replace conventional linear transformations and node-based nonlinearities with spline-based function approximations distributed along network edges. Although KANs offer strong expressivity and interpretability, their heterogeneous spline and base branch parameters hinder efficient quantization, which remains unexamined compared to CNNs and Transformers. In this paper, we present QuantKAN, a unified framework for quantizing KANs across both quantization aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) regimes. QuantKAN extends modern quantization algorithms, such as LSQ, LSQ+, PACT, DoReFa, QIL, GPTQ, BRECQ, AdaRound, AWQ, and HAWQ-V2, to spline based layers with branch-specific quantizers for base, spline, and activation components. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR 10, and CIFAR 100 across multiple KAN variants (EfficientKAN, FastKAN, PyKAN, and KAGN), we establish the first systematic benchmarks for low-bit spline networks. Our results show that KANs, particularly deeper KAGN variants, are compatible with low-bit quantization but exhibit strong method architecture interactions: LSQ, LSQ+, and PACT preserve near full precision accuracy at 4 bit for shallow KAN MLP and ConvNet models, while DoReFa provides the most stable behavior for deeper KAGN under aggressive low-bit settings. For PTQ, GPTQ and Uniform consistently deliver the strongest overall performance across datasets, with BRECQ highly competitive on simpler regimes such as MNIST. Our proposed QuantKAN framework thus unifies spline learning and quantization, and provides practical tools and guidelines for efficiently deploying KANs in real-world, resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRIT-LP, a graph transformer designed for polar ice layer thickness estimation, overcoming oversmoothing and weak long-range dependency modeling issues, and achieves a significant improvement in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating ice layer thickness is critical for understanding snow accumulation, reconstructing past climate, and addressing uncertainties in future ice sheet and sea level projections.

Method: GRIT-LP combines an inductive geometric graph learning framework with a self-attention mechanism, using a partitioned spatial graph construction and long-range skip connection strategy to address challenges in spatio-temporal ice layer modeling.

Result: GRIT-LP shows a significant improvement, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with a 24.92% better root mean squared error.

Conclusion: Graph transformers like GRIT-LP effectively model spatiotemporal patterns by preserving spatial coherence and capturing both localized and long-range dependencies, advancing data-driven cryosphere understanding.

Abstract: Graph transformers have demonstrated remarkable capability on complex spatio-temporal tasks, yet their depth is often limited by oversmoothing and weak long-range dependency modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce GRIT-LP, a graph transformer explicitly designed for polar ice-layer thickness estimation from polar radar imagery. Accurately estimating ice layer thickness is critical for understanding snow accumulation, reconstructing past climate patterns and reducing uncertainties in projections of future ice sheet evolution and sea level rise. GRIT-LP combines an inductive geometric graph learning framework with self-attention mechanism, and introduces two major innovations that jointly address challenges in modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of ice layers: a partitioned spatial graph construction strategy that forms overlapping, fully connected local neighborhoods to preserve spatial coherence and suppress noise from irrelevant long-range links, and a long-range skip connection mechanism within the transformer that improves information flow and mitigates oversmoothing in deeper attention layers. We conducted extensive experiments, demonstrating that GRIT-LP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 24.92\% improvement in root mean squared error. These results highlight the effectiveness of graph transformers in modeling spatiotemporal patterns by capturing both localized structural features and long-range dependencies across internal ice layers, and demonstrate their potential to advance data-driven understanding of cryospheric processes.

*Adarsh Kumarappan,Ayushi Mehrotra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a more practical probabilistic framework to certify defenses against various jailbreaking attacks for LLMs, improving upon the limitations of the SmoothLLM approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the impractical assumptions in the SmoothLLM defense for certifying LLMs against jailbreaking attacks, aiming for a framework that reflects real-world behavior.

Method: The authors propose a probabilistic framework, (k, ε)-unstable, and derive a data-informed lower bound for SmoothLLM's defense probability using empirical attack models.

Result: The framework delivers a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate, certifying defenses against diverse jailbreaking attacks such as GCG and PAIR.

Conclusion: This work introduces a meaningful mechanism to enhance the safety guarantees for LLMs, making them more resistant to exploitations while aligning certifications with real-world behaviors.

Abstract: The SmoothLLM defense provides a certification guarantee against jailbreaking attacks, but it relies on a strict `k-unstable' assumption that rarely holds in practice. This strong assumption can limit the trustworthiness of the provided safety certificate. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic probabilistic framework, `(k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable,' to certify defenses against diverse jailbreaking attacks, from gradient-based (GCG) to semantic (PAIR). We derive a new, data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability by incorporating empirical models of attack success, providing a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate. By introducing the notion of (k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable, our framework provides practitioners with actionable safety guarantees, enabling them to set certification thresholds that better reflect the real-world behavior of LLMs. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical and theoretically-grounded mechanism to make LLMs more resistant to the exploitation of their safety alignments, a critical challenge in secure AI deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maximize structural longevity in autonomous material systems via adaptive control methodologies.

Method: Framing self-healing as an RL problem using Markov Decision Processes and evaluating RL agents (Q-learning, DQN, TD3) against heuristic baselines.

Result: RL agents significantly outperformed heuristics; TD3 was superior in convergence speed, stability, and material recovery.

Conclusion: Fine-grained, dynamic actuation via RL enhances efficiency and effectiveness in self-healing material systems.

Abstract: The transition to autonomous material systems necessitates adaptive control methodologies to maximize structural longevity. This study frames the self-healing process as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem within a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling agents to autonomously derive optimal policies that efficiently balance structural integrity maintenance against finite resource consumption. A comparative evaluation of discrete-action (Q-learning, DQN) and continuous-action (TD3) agents in a stochastic simulation environment revealed that RL controllers significantly outperform heuristic baselines, achieving near-complete material recovery. Crucially, the TD3 agent utilizing continuous dosage control demonstrated superior convergence speed and stability, underscoring the necessity of fine-grained, proportional actuation in dynamic self-healing applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer-based neural network to predict football player and team actions during matches, considering game dynamics and player interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately forecasting each player's actions during football matches is beneficial for tactical decisions, sports betting, and analysis.

Method: A novel axial transformer is introduced, enabling efficient temporal and player interaction modeling, jointly predicting multi-step game-level actions.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the model's reliability, predicting ~75,000 live events per game with low latency.

Conclusion: The axial transformer proves effective for real-time player action prediction in football matches, optimizing performance across applications.

Abstract: Football (soccer) is a sport that is characterised by complex game play, where players perform a variety of actions, such as passes, shots, tackles, fouls, in order to score goals, and ultimately win matches. Accurately forecasting the total number of each action that each player will complete during a match is desirable for a variety of applications, including tactical decision-making, sports betting, and for television broadcast commentary and analysis. Such predictions must consider the game state, the ability and skill of the players in both teams, the interactions between the players, and the temporal dynamics of the game as it develops. In this paper, we present a transformer-based neural network that jointly and recurrently predicts the expected totals for thirteen individual actions at multiple time-steps during the match, and where predictions are made for each individual player, each team and at the game-level. The neural network is based on an \emph{axial transformer} that efficiently captures the temporal dynamics as the game progresses, and the interactions between the players at each time-step. We present a novel axial transformer design that we show is equivalent to a regular sequential transformer, and the design performs well experimentally. We show empirically that the model can make consistent and reliable predictions, and efficiently makes $\sim$75,000 live predictions at low latency for each game.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Wavelet Attention (WA) module and the Spectral Attention Operator Transformer (SAOT), which combine the strengths of wavelet and Fourier-based approaches to improve the handling of PDE mappings without losing local details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), such as over-smoothing solutions and the inability to capture local details and high-frequency components, by leveraging the spatial-frequency localization properties of Wavelet transforms.

Method: The authors propose a Wavelet Attention (WA) module with linear computational complexity that learns locality-aware features. They further develop SAOT, a hybrid framework that combines WA's localized focus with the global field of Fourier-based Attention (FA) using a gated fusion block.

Result: The experimental results show that WA addresses the limitations of FA and surpasses existing Wavelet-based neural operators. Moreover, SAOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in six operator learning benchmarks while being discretization-invariant.

Conclusion: By integrating wavelet-based locality awareness and Fourier-based global representations, the proposed SAOT framework significantly enhances performance and overcomes prior challenges in neural operator learning.

Abstract: Neural operators have shown great potential in solving a family of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by modeling the mappings between input and output functions. Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) implements global convolutions via parameterizing the integral operators in Fourier space. However, it often results in over-smoothing solutions and fails to capture local details and high-frequency components. To address these limitations, we investigate incorporating the spatial-frequency localization property of Wavelet transforms into the Transformer architecture. We propose a novel Wavelet Attention (WA) module with linear computational complexity to efficiently learn locality-aware features. Building upon WA, we further develop the Spectral Attention Operator Transformer (SAOT), a hybrid spectral Transformer framework that integrates WA's localized focus with the global receptive field of Fourier-based Attention (FA) through a gated fusion block. Experimental results demonstrate that WA significantly mitigates the limitations of FA and outperforms existing Wavelet-based neural operators by a large margin. By integrating the locality-aware and global spectral representations, SAOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six operator learning benchmarks and exhibits strong discretization-invariant ability.

*Renchu Guan,Xuyang Li,Yachao Zhang,Wei Pang,Fausto Giunchiglia,Ximing Li,Yonghao Liu,Xiaoyue Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes HONOR, an unsupervised hypergraph contrastive learning framework for both homophilic and heterophilic hypergraphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hypergraph neural networks rely on homophily assumptions, which fail in datasets with heterophilic structures. This limits their applicability in real-world scenarios with diverse relationships.

Method: HONOR introduces a prompt-based hyperedge feature construction strategy for global semantic consistency, an adaptive attention aggregation module for capturing local contributions, and incorporates high-pass filtering to better model heterophilic structures.

Result: HONOR achieves superior performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets, as shown through theoretical guarantees and extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed HONOR framework offers robust, generalizable, and discriminative node and hyperedge representations for hypergraphs, overcoming limitations of existing models reliant on the homophily assumption.

Abstract: Hypergraphs, as a generalization of traditional graphs, naturally capture high-order relationships. In recent years, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) have been widely used to capture complex high-order relationships. However, most existing hypergraph neural network methods inherently rely on the homophily assumption, which often does not hold in real-world scenarios that exhibit significant heterophilic structures. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{HONOR}, a novel unsupervised \textbf{H}ypergraph c\textbf{ON}trastive learning framework suitable for both hom\textbf{O}philic and hete\textbf{R}ophilic hypergraphs. Specifically, HONOR explicitly models the heterophilic relationships between hyperedges and nodes through two complementary mechanisms: a prompt-based hyperedge feature construction strategy that maintains global semantic consistency while suppressing local noise, and an adaptive attention aggregation module that dynamically captures the diverse local contributions of nodes to hyperedges. Combined with high-pass filtering, these designs enable HONOR to fully exploit heterophilic connection patterns, yielding more discriminative and robust node and hyperedge representations. Theoretically, we demonstrate the superior generalization ability and robustness of HONOR. Empirically, extensive experiments further validate that HONOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

Motivation: The motivation is to make deep learning-based heart rate estimation models deployable on wearable devices by addressing strict memory and latency constraints.

Method: The paper tests four distillation methods—hard distillation, soft distillation, decoupled knowledge distillation, and feature distillation—while analyzing the scaling laws between model size and performance.

Result: The researchers successfully characterize the scaling laws and provide insights into how larger pre-trained models can be distilled for real-time edge deployment.

Conclusion: This study provides foundational knowledge for creating compact, efficient physiological sensing models deployable in real-time on wearable devices.

Abstract: Heart rate estimation from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals generated by wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers has significant implications for the health and well-being of individuals. Although prior work has demonstrated deep learning models with strong performance in the heart rate estimation task, in order to deploy these models on wearable devices, these models must also adhere to strict memory and latency constraints. In this work, we explore and characterize how large pre-trained PPG models may be distilled to smaller models appropriate for real-time inference on the edge. We evaluate four distillation strategies through comprehensive sweeps of teacher and student model capacities: (1) hard distillation, (2) soft distillation, (3) decoupled knowledge distillation (DKD), and (4) feature distillation. We present a characterization of the resulting scaling laws describing the relationship between model size and performance. This early investigation lays the groundwork for practical and predictable methods for building edge-deployable models for physiological sensing.

Abstract: Existing deep learning models for Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) struggle with temporal irregularities, particularly stochastic event durations and overlapping timestamps, limiting their adaptability across heterogeneous datasets. We propose a dual input neural network strategy that separates event and sequence attributes, using a duration-aware pseudo-embedding matrix to transform temporal importance into compact, learnable representations.

All models incorporate self-tuned hypermodels for adaptive architecture selection. Experiments on balanced and imbalanced outcome prediction tasks show that duration pseudo-embedding inputs consistently improve generalization, reduce model complexity, and enhance interpretability. Our results demonstrate the benefits of explicit temporal encoding and provide a flexible design for robust, real-world PPM applications.

Conclusion: HGNN(O) offers a robust and efficient AutoML framework that provides generalizable benchmarks for outcome prediction on event-sequence data.

Abstract: This paper introduces HGNN(O), an AutoML GNN hypermodel framework for outcome prediction on event-sequence data. Building on our earlier work on graph convolutional network hypermodels, HGNN(O) extends four architectures-One Level, Two Level, Two Level Pseudo Embedding, and Two Level Embedding-across six canonical GNN operators. A self-tuning mechanism based on Bayesian optimization with pruning and early stopping enables efficient adaptation over architectures and hyperparameters without manual configuration. Empirical evaluation on both balanced and imbalanced event logs shows that HGNN(O) achieves accuracy exceeding 0.98 on the Traffic Fines dataset and weighted F1 scores up to 0.86 on the Patients dataset without explicit imbalance handling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaveTuner, a wavelet-based framework addressing limitations in time series forecasting by focusing on high-frequency components. It achieves state-of-the-art results on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve time series forecasting by addressing biases in conventional wavelet-based methods, which underutilize informative high-frequency components crucial for precise predictions.

Method: WaveTuner integrates an Adaptive Wavelet Refinement module for dynamic subband weighting and a Multi-Branch Specialization module employing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to specialize in modeling specific spectral subbands.

Result: WaveTuner's comprehensive tuning of global trends and local variations leads to state-of-the-art forecasting performance, validated by experiments on eight real-world datasets.

Conclusion: WaveTuner provides a robust and unified time-frequency framework that leverages high-frequency components effectively, improving overall forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Due to the inherent complexity, temporal patterns in real-world time series often evolve across multiple intertwined scales, including long-term periodicity, short-term fluctuations, and abrupt regime shifts. While existing literature has designed many sophisticated decomposition approaches based on the time or frequency domain to partition trend-seasonality components and high-low frequency components, an alternative line of approaches based on the wavelet domain has been proposed to provide a unified multi-resolution representation with precise time-frequency localization. However, most wavelet-based methods suffer from a persistent bias toward recursively decomposing only low-frequency components, severely underutilizing subtle yet informative high-frequency components that are pivotal for precise time series forecasting. To address this problem, we propose WaveTuner, a Wavelet decomposition framework empowered by full-spectrum subband Tuning for time series forecasting. Concretely, WaveTuner comprises two key modules: (i) Adaptive Wavelet Refinement module, that transforms time series into time-frequency coefficients, utilizes an adaptive router to dynamically assign subband weights, and generates subband-specific embeddings to support refinement; and (ii) Multi-Branch Specialization module, that employs multiple functional branches, each instantiated as a flexible Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with a distinct functional order to model a specific spectral subband. Equipped with these modules, WaveTuner comprehensively tunes global trends and local variations within a unified time-frequency framework. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate WaveTuner achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance in time series forecasting.

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel method, UAdapterGNN, to enhance robustness and generalization of pre-trained GNN models by incorporating uncertainty learning to mitigate graph noise during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AdapterGNN methods struggle to handle noise in graph data during fine-tuning, limiting their robustness and generalizability.

Method: UAdapterGNN integrates Gaussian probabilistic adapters into pre-trained GNNs to absorb noise effects using variance adjustments in the distribution.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks show UAdapterGNN improves robustness and generalization in adapting pre-trained GNNs for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty learning in pre-trained GNN adapters effectively addresses noise challenges and boosts model performance in graph learning tasks.

Abstract: Recently, fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained GNNs has yielded remarkable attention in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream graph learning tasks. One representative fine-tuning method is to exploit adapter (termed AdapterGNN) which aims to 'augment' the pre-trained model by inserting a lightweight module to make the 'augmented' model better adapt to the downstream tasks. However, graph data may contain various types of noise in downstream tasks, such as noisy edges and ambiguous node attributes. Existing AdapterGNNs are often prone to graph noise and exhibit limited generalizability. How to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of GNNs' fine tuning remains an open problem. In this paper, we show that the above problem can be well addressed by integrating uncertainty learning into the GNN adapter. We propose the Uncertainty-aware Adapter (UAdapterGNN) that fortifies pre-trained GNN models against noisy graph data in the fine-tuning process. Specifically, in contrast to regular AdapterGNN, our UAdapterGNN exploits Gaussian probabilistic adapter to augment the pre-trained GNN model. In this way, when the graph contains various noises,our method can automatically absorb the effects of changes in the variances of the Gaussian distribution, thereby significantly enhancing the model's robustness. Also, UAdapterGNN can further improve the generalization ability of the model on the downstream tasks.

TL;DR: KernelBand is a framework for optimizing kernel performance in LLMs by framing the problem as a hierarchical decision-making process, utilizing hardware profiling and runtime clustering, with superior performance shown in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiencies and high expertise requirement in optimizing kernels for LLMs, and aims to improve the balance between exploration and exploitation in the optimization space.

Method: They propose KernelBand, which models kernel optimization as a hierarchical multi-armed bandit problem, using profiling data and clustering methods to guide decision-making efficiently.

Result: KernelBand achieves significant performance improvement over existing methods in TritonBench, requiring fewer tokens and showing continued improvements with increasing resources.

Conclusion: KernelBand presents a robust solution for kernel optimization, effectively reducing costs and overcoming limitations of previous methods while enabling scalable, consistent performance gains.

Abstract: High quality kernels are critical for reducing training and inference costs of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they traditionally require significant expertise in hardware architecture and software optimization. While recent advances in LLM-based code generation show promise for complex optimization, existing methods struggle with the vast optimization space due to insufficient hardware domain knowledge, failing to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. We present KernelBand, a novel framework that formulates kernel optimization as a hierarchical multi-armed bandit problem, enabling LLM agents to strategically navigate the optimization space by treating kernel selection and optimization strategy application as sequential decision-making processes. Our approach leverages hardware profiling information to identify promising optimization strategies and employs runtime behavior clustering to reduce exploration overhead across kernel candidates. Extensive experiments on TritonBench demonstrate that KernelBand significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance with fewer tokens while exhibiting consistent improvement without saturation as computational resources increase.

*Jian Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in RL training by separating inference and training deployment, presenting an asynchronous framework for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance training efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL), addressing the limitations of synchronous execution in mainstream RL frameworks.

Method: The authors redesigned an asynchronous framework by separating inference and training, improving the data loader, and utilizing a unified tri-model architecture with a shared-prompt attention mask.

Result: Achieved at least a threefold improvement in RL training performance on NPU platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances the efficiency of RL training while maintaining algorithm accuracy, offering potential for broader application.

Abstract: Since the introduction of the GRPO algorithm, reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted increasing attention, with growing efforts to reproduce and apply it. However, training efficiency remains a critical challenge. In mainstream RL frameworks, inference and training are typically deployed on the same devices. While this approach reduces costs through resource consolidation, its synchronous execution imposes a computational coupling that prevents concurrent inference and training. In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy. It is worth emphasizing that we apply a unified tri-model architecture in the training phase, and we also proposed a shared-prompt attention mask to reduce repetitive computation. In practice, these works have achieved at least a threefold overall performance improvement in RL training on NPU platforms, indicating its potential for widespread application.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hi-SAFE, a secure and efficient aggregation framework for sign-based federated learning (FL), addressing privacy, communication efficiency, and user scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address privacy vulnerabilities and resource inefficiencies in sign-based FL methods, which are critical in constrained environments like IoT and edge networks.

Method: Hi-SAFE constructs efficient majority vote polynomials using Fermat's Little Theorem and employs a hierarchical subgrouping strategy to limit computational complexity.

Result: Hi-SAFE achieves cryptographically secure aggregation for sign-based FL, ensuring low overhead and scalability regardless of the number of users.

Conclusion: Hi-SAFE effectively combines privacy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a viable solution for FL in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces challenges in ensuring both privacy and communication efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as Internet of Things (IoT) and edge networks. While sign-based methods, such as sign stochastic gradient descent with majority voting (SIGNSGD-MV), offer substantial bandwidth savings, they remain vulnerable to inference attacks due to exposure of gradient signs. Existing secure aggregation techniques are either incompatible with sign-based methods or incur prohibitive overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Hi-SAFE, a lightweight and cryptographically secure aggregation framework for sign-based FL. Our core contribution is the construction of efficient majority vote polynomials for SIGNSGD-MV, derived from Fermat's Little Theorem. This formulation represents the majority vote as a low-degree polynomial over a finite field, enabling secure evaluation that hides intermediate values and reveals only the final result. We further introduce a hierarchical subgrouping strategy that ensures constant multiplicative depth and bounded per-user complexity, independent of the number of users n.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving real-device latency of small language models (SLMs) by investigating depth-width ratios, operator choices, and training strategies. It introduces Nemotron-Flash, a new family of hybrid SLMs, with significant gains in accuracy, latency, and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLM designs often prioritize parameter efficiency, which doesn't equate to real-device speed-ups necessary for latency-critical applications. The need is to explore the architectural factors affecting real-device latency and propose optimized solutions.

Method: Key elements explored include the depth-width ratio for small-batch latency, efficient attention operators for overall latency and throughput, and weight normalization for better convergence. The authors use evolutionary search to identify optimal operator combinations for hybrid SLMs.

Result: Nemotron-Flash SLMs outperform state-of-the-art models, achieving over +5.5% accuracy, 1.3x/1.9x reduced latency, and 18.7x/45.6x improved throughput, significantly advancing the accuracy-efficiency frontier.

Conclusion: The research introduces generalizable architectural and training strategies that focus on optimizing real-device latency in SLMs, setting a new standard in the field with Nemotron-Flash.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of small language models (SLMs) is essential for numerous real-world applications with stringent latency constraints. While previous work on SLM design has primarily focused on reducing the number of parameters to achieve parameter-optimal SLMs, parameter efficiency does not necessarily translate into proportional real-device speed-ups. This work aims to identify the key determinants of SLMs' real-device latency and offer generalizable principles and methodologies for SLM design and training when real-device latency is the primary consideration. Specifically, we identify two central architectural factors: depth-width ratios and operator choices. The former is crucial for small-batch-size latency, while the latter affects both latency and large-batch-size throughput. In light of this, we first study latency-optimal depth-width ratios, with the key finding that although deep-thin models generally achieve better accuracy under the same parameter budget, they may not lie on the accuracy-latency trade-off frontier. Next, we explore emerging efficient attention alternatives to evaluate their potential as candidate building operators. Using the identified promising operators, we construct an evolutionary search framework to automatically discover latency-optimal combinations of these operators within hybrid SLMs, thereby advancing the accuracy-latency frontier. In addition to architectural improvements, we further enhance SLM training using a weight normalization technique that enables more effective weight updates and improves final convergence. Combining these methods, we introduce a new family of hybrid SLMs, called Nemotron-Flash, which significantly advances the accuracy-efficiency frontier of state-of-the-art SLMs, e.g., achieving over +5.5% average accuracy, 1.3x/1.9x lower latency, and 18.7x/45.6x higher throughput compared to Qwen3-1.7B/0.6B, respectively.

*Zengjie Hu,Jiantao Qiu,Tianyi Bai,Haojin Yang,Binhang Yuan,Qi Jing,Conghui He,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VADE, a dynamic sampling framework to address gradient vanishing issues in group-based policy optimization methods by amplifying training signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group-based policy optimization methods struggle with gradient vanishing when identical rewards are given within a group, diminishing training effectiveness.

Method: VADE employs online difficulty estimation with Beta distributions, Thompson sampling for information gain, and a two-scale prior decay mechanism for robust dynamic selection of informative samples.

Result: VADE consistently outperforms baselines in multimodal reasoning benchmarks, excelling in both performance and sample efficiency while dramatically reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: VADE effectively resolves gradient vanishing issues, enhances training signals, and integrates seamlessly with existing algorithms as a plug-and-play solution for multimodal group-based RL models.

Abstract: Group-based policy optimization methods like GRPO and GSPO have become standard for training multimodal models, leveraging group-wise rollouts and relative advantage estimation. However, they suffer from a critical \emph{gradient vanishing} problem when all responses within a group receive identical rewards, causing advantage estimates to collapse and training signals to diminish. Existing attempts to mitigate this issue fall into two paradigms: filtering-based and sampling-based methods. Filtering-based methods first generate rollouts broadly and then retroactively filter out uninformative groups, leading to substantial computational overhead. Sampling-based methods proactively select effective samples before rollout but rely on static criteria or prior dataset knowledge, lacking real-time adaptability. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{VADE}, a \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{D}ynamic sampling framework via online sample-level difficulty \textbf{E}stimation. Our framework integrates three key components: online sample-level difficulty estimation using Beta distributions, a Thompson sampler that maximizes information gain through the estimated correctness probability, and a two-scale prior decay mechanism that maintains robust estimation under policy evolution. This three components design enables VADE to dynamically select the most informative samples, thereby amplifying training signals while eliminating extra rollout costs. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that VADE consistently outperforms strong baselines in both performance and sample efficiency, while achieving a dramatic reduction in computational overhead. More importantly, our framework can serves as a plug-and-play component to be seamlessly integrated into existing group-based RL algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a lightweight neural operator architecture that generalizes across grid resolutions without heavy computational requirements.

Method: MCNO uses randomly sampled points to approximate kernel integrals directly, avoiding reliance on spectral or translation-invariance assumptions.

Result: MCNO achieves competitive accuracy on 1D PDE benchmarks while minimizing computational costs.

Conclusion: MCNO offers a practical alternative to existing neural operators by providing simpler design and generalization capability.

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a lightweight architecture for learning solution operators for parametric PDEs by directly approximating the kernel integral using a Monte Carlo approach. Unlike Fourier Neural Operators, MCNO makes no spectral or translation-invariance assumptions. The kernel is represented as a learnable tensor over a fixed set of randomly sampled points. This design enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO achieves competitive accuracy with low computational cost, providing a simple and practical alternative to spectral and graph-based neural operators.

*German Gritsai,Megan Richards,Maxime Méloux,Kyunghyun Cho,Maxime Peyrard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neural network-based mutual information (MI) estimator, trained on synthetic data to predict MI accurately, while also providing uncertainty quantification via quantile regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a more efficient, flexible, and reliable method for estimating mutual information, overcoming the limitations of classical approaches and neural baselines.

Method: A data-driven MI estimator is parameterized with a neural network, trained on a meta-dataset of synthetic data. It employs an attention mechanism for handling variable sample sizes and quantile regression to provide uncertainty measures.

Result: The proposed method outperforms classical baselines in MI estimation, provides well-calibrated uncertainties, and is faster than other neural-based MI estimators.

Conclusion: The fully differentiable MI estimator enhances empirical performance while enabling embedding into larger machine learning pipelines. It also adapts flexibly to diverse data types using normalizing flows.

Abstract: We propose a fully data-driven approach to designing mutual information (MI) estimators. Since any MI estimator is a function of the observed sample from two random variables, we parameterize this function with a neural network (MIST) and train it end-to-end to predict MI values. Training is performed on a large meta-dataset of 625,000 synthetic joint distributions with known ground-truth MI. To handle variable sample sizes and dimensions, we employ a two-dimensional attention scheme ensuring permutation invariance across input samples. To quantify uncertainty, we optimize a quantile regression loss, enabling the estimator to approximate the sampling distribution of MI rather than return a single point estimate. This research program departs from prior work by taking a fully empirical route, trading universal theoretical guarantees for flexibility and efficiency. Empirically, the learned estimators largely outperform classical baselines across sample sizes and dimensions, including on joint distributions unseen during training. The resulting quantile-based intervals are well-calibrated and more reliable than bootstrap-based confidence intervals, while inference is orders of magnitude faster than existing neural baselines. Beyond immediate empirical gains, this framework yields trainable, fully differentiable estimators that can be embedded into larger learning pipelines. Moreover, exploiting MI's invariance to invertible transformations, meta-datasets can be adapted to arbitrary data modalities via normalizing flows, enabling flexible training for diverse target meta-distributions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph compression framework Cutter to efficiently evaluate graph robustness against adversarial attacks while preserving key properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating robustness of large graphs under adversarial attacks is computationally demanding, requiring scalable solutions.

Method: Cutter employs a dual-agent reinforcement learning setup with Vital Detection Agent (VDA) and Redundancy Detection Agent (RDA) to compress graphs. Strategies like reward shaping, prototype-based shaping, and cross-agent imitation enhance its performance.

Result: Cutter effectively compresses real-world graphs while maintaining topological structure and robustness trends, enabling efficient and reliable evaluation.

Conclusion: Cutter improves evaluation efficiency for robustness in large graphs without losing fidelity, based on robust compression techniques.

Abstract: As graph-structured data grow increasingly large, evaluating their robustness under adversarial attacks becomes computationally expensive and difficult to scale. To address this challenge, we propose to compress graphs into compact representations that preserve both topological structure and robustness profile, enabling efficient and reliable evaluation.We propose Cutter, a dual-agent reinforcement learning framework composed of a Vital Detection Agent (VDA) and a Redundancy Detection Agent (RDA), which collaboratively identify structurally vital and redundant nodes for guided compression. Cutter incorporates three key strategies to enhance learning efficiency and compression quality: trajectory-level reward shaping to transform sparse trajectory returns into dense, policy-equivalent learning signals; prototype-based shaping to guide decisions using behavioral patterns from both highand low-return trajectories; and cross-agent imitation to enable safer and more transferable exploration. Experiments on multiple real-world graphs demonstrate that Cutter generates compressed graphs that retain essential static topological properties and exhibit robustness degradation trends highly consistent with the original graphs under various attack scenarios, thereby significantly improving evaluation efficiency without compromising assessment fidelity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastForward Pruning is a novel framework for optimizing layer-wise sparsity in large language models, achieving superior results with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for pruning large language models are either computationally expensive or suboptimal, necessitating a more efficient and effective solution.

Method: The paper introduces a decoupled RL framework where policy optimization is separated from budget satisfaction, employing a curriculum-based strategy to reduce computational complexity.

Result: FastForward Pruning produces better pruning policies compared to heuristic baselines and demonstrates competitive or superior performance at significantly lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the efficiency of policy searches for compressing large language models, proving its effectiveness and computational edge over existing methods.

Abstract: Pruning is an effective method for compressing Large Language Models, but finding an optimal, non-uniform layer-wise sparsity allocation remains a key challenge. While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models. To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines. Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency.

Motivation: Biological brains inspire dynamic models for lifelong learning, addressing challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and loss of plasticity.

Result: DynamicMoE is benchmarked against existing network expansion approaches, emphasizing efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: DynamicMoE shows promise as an effective solution for addressing lifelong learning through dynamic capacity growth.

Abstract: The challenge of building neural networks that can continuously learn and adapt to evolving data streams is central to the fields of continual learning (CL) and reinforcement learning (RL). This lifelong learning problem is often framed in terms of the plasticity-stability dilemma, focusing on issues like loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting. Unlike neural networks, biological brains maintain plasticity through capacity growth, inspiring researchers to explore similar approaches in artificial networks, such as adding capacity dynamically. Prior solutions often lack parameter efficiency or depend on explicit task indices, but Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer a promising alternative by specializing experts for distinct distributions. This paper aims to evaluate a DynamicMoE approach for continual and reinforcement learning environments and benchmark its effectiveness against existing network expansion methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic framework for 3D radio maps in multi-UAV networks to address connectivity challenges caused by varied user density, 3D mobility, and limited power budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve wireless network reliability in environments where power distribution is dynamic due to 3D mobility and fluctuating user demand, which are intensified by UAV deployment.

Method: A Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder extracts spatial information from 3D radio maps, while a Transformer module predicts future power distributions by capturing temporal dependencies.

Result: Experiments show the framework accurately predicts power dynamics and outperforms existing models in reconstructing and forecasting radio maps.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D-DRM framework effectively improves radio mapping in dynamic UAV scenarios by accounting for spatio-temporal variations in power distributions.

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWN) are rapidly expanding with the growing deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for logistics, surveillance, and emergency response. Reliable connectivity remains a critical yet challenging task due to three-dimensional (3D) mobility, time-varying user density, and limited power budgets. The transmit power of base stations (BSs) fluctuates dynamically according to user locations and traffic demands, leading to a highly non-stationary 3D radio environment. Radio maps (RMs) have emerged as an effective means to characterize spatial power distributions and support radio-aware network optimization. However, most existing works construct static or offline RMs, overlooking real-time power variations and spatio-temporal dependencies in multi-UAV networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a {3D dynamic radio map (3D-DRM)} framework that learns and predicts the spatio-temporal evolution of received power. Specially, a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder extracts high-dimensional spatial representations from 3D RMs, while a Transformer-based module models sequential dependencies to predict future power distributions. Experiments unveil that 3D-DRM accurately captures fast-varying power dynamics and substantially outperforms baseline models in both RM reconstruction and short-term prediction.

TL;DR: Proposes OrdMoE, a preference alignment framework for MLLMs, avoiding external human data by utilizing intrinsic signals from Mixture-of-Experts architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference learning approaches in MLLMs heavily rely on expensive and impractical human-annotated preference data.

Method: OrdMoE utilizes the router's expert selection scores to establish an internal preference hierarchy, leveraging self-supervised learning to group experts into tiers for generating responses.

Result: Experimental results show OrdMoE enhances alignment and performance in multimodal benchmarks, achieving competitive results without external preference data.

Conclusion: OrdMoE offers a novel and cost-efficient method for preference learning in MLLMs, utilizing internal model signals to bypass human annotation.

Abstract: Preference learning has recently emerged as a pivotal strategy for post-training alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly rely on external human-annotated preference data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. In this work, we propose OrdMoE, a novel preference alignment framework that bypasses the reliance on external human preferences entirely by leveraging intrinsic signals within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Specifically, we observe that the router's expert selection scores implicitly encode a quality-aware ranking of responses (i.e. higher-scoring experts consistently generate higher-quality outputs). Building on this insight, OrdMoE constructs an internal preference hierarchy by grouping experts into ranked tiers based on their per-token routing scores and activating each tier separately to produce a sequence of responses with increasing quality. This yields a zero-cost, self-supervised preference ordering over generated responses, which can be directly optimized using standard preference learning objectives. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demnstrate that OrdMoE significantly enhances both alignment and overall performance of multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, achieving competitive results without requiring any human-annotated preference data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Laplacian positional encoding to improve graph neural networks' expressiveness limitations. This encoding is invariant, allows node identifiability, and performs better than Weisfeiler-Lehman constrained methods. It is tested on a drug-drug interaction task with notable improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current graph neural networks constrained by the one-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman test, which fails to identify structurally distinct nodes.

Method: Proposes a Laplacian positional encoding that is invariant to eigenvector sign flips and eigenspace basis rotations. This encoding enables node identifiability and superior sample-complexity via spectral properties. It incorporates monotone shortest-path to diffusion links, spectral trilateration, and spectral injectivity.

Result: When applied with a neural-process style decoder, the proposed method shows significant performance gains in drug-drug interaction tasks, improving metrics such as the area under the ROC curve and F1 score.

Conclusion: Introducing principled positional encodings resolves theoretical expressiveness barriers in graph neural networks, yielding both theoretical and practical benefits.

Abstract: Message passing graph neural networks are widely used for learning on graphs, yet their expressive power is limited by the one-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman test and can fail to distinguish structurally different nodes. We provide rigorous theory for a Laplacian positional encoding that is invariant to eigenvector sign flips and to basis rotations within eigenspaces. We prove that this encoding yields node identifiability from a constant number of observations and establishes a sample-complexity separation from architectures constrained by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The analysis combines a monotone link between shortest-path and diffusion distance, spectral trilateration with a constant set of anchors, and quantitative spectral injectivity with logarithmic embedding size. As an instantiation, pairing this encoding with a neural-process style decoder yields significant gains on a drug-drug interaction task on chemical graphs, improving both the area under the ROC curve and the F1 score and demonstrating the practical benefits of resolving theoretical expressiveness limitations with principled positional information.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in asynchronous federated learning (AFL) due to client heterogeneity and information staleness, proposing theoretical analysis and new methods: ACE and ACED.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues of amplified client heterogeneity and information delay in asynchronous federated learning, especially under non-IID data conditions.

Method: Theoretical analysis is conducted to map AFL design choices to heterogeneity amplification effects, followed by the proposal of ACE and ACED methods to reduce participation imbalance and mitigate staleness.

Result: Experiments validate theoretical insights and show robust performance of ACE and ACED under varying heterogeneity and delay settings, improving AFL effectiveness.

Conclusion: The research establishes solutions to overcome challenges in AFL by addressing heterogeneity amplification and delay effects, enhancing system reliability and fairness.

Abstract: In Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL), the central server immediately updates the global model with each arriving client's contribution. As a result, clients perform their local training on different model versions, causing information staleness (delay). In federated environments with non-IID local data distributions, this asynchronous pattern amplifies the adverse effect of client heterogeneity (due to different data distribution, local objectives, etc.), as faster clients contribute more frequent updates, biasing the global model. We term this phenomenon heterogeneity amplification. Our work provides a theoretical analysis that maps AFL design choices to their resulting error sources when heterogeneity amplification occurs. Guided by our analysis, we propose ACE (All-Client Engagement AFL), which mitigates participation imbalance through immediate, non-buffered updates that use the latest information available from all clients. We also introduce a delay-aware variant, ACED, to balance client diversity against update staleness. Experiments on different models for different tasks across diverse heterogeneity and delay settings validate our analysis and demonstrate the robust performance of our approaches.

TL;DR: Introduces kinetic path energy (KPE) to analyze generative trajectories in flow-based models, showing a link between semantic richness and sampling effort, as well as density correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the information hidden in sampling trajectories of generative models and their implications for semantic richness and density.

Method: Utilized kinetic path energy (KPE) as a diagnostic to quantify kinetic effort in trajectory analysis for ODE-based sampling.

Result: Higher kinetic path energy correlates with better semantic quality and inversely correlates with data density, highlighting distribution sparsity importance.

Conclusion: Trajectory-level diagnostics like KPE reveal critical insights into generative model behavior and sample characteristics, linking effort to semantic richness and generation difficulty.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models synthesize data by integrating a learned velocity field from a reference distribution to the target data distribution. Prior work has focused on endpoint metrics (e.g., fidelity, likelihood, perceptual quality) while overlooking a deeper question: what do the sampling trajectories reveal? Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce kinetic path energy (KPE), a simple yet powerful diagnostic that quantifies the total kinetic effort along each generation path of ODE-based samplers. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-256, we uncover two key phenomena: ({i}) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic quality, indicating that semantically richer samples require greater kinetic effort, and ({ii}) higher KPE inversely correlates with data density, with informative samples residing in sparse, low-density regions. Together, these findings reveal that semantically informative samples naturally reside on the sparse frontier of the data distribution, demanding greater generative effort. Our results suggest that trajectory-level analysis offers a physics-inspired and interpretable framework for understanding generation difficulty and sample characteristics.

Abstract: The advent of financial technology has witnessed a surge in the utilization of deep learning models to anticipate consumer conduct, a trend that has demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing lending strategies and bolstering market efficiency. We study multi-horizon demand forecasting on e-commerce transactions using the UCI Online Retail II dataset. Unlike prior versions of this manuscript that mixed financial-loan narratives with retail data, we focus exclusively on retail market behavior and define a clear prediction target: per SKU daily demand (or revenue) for horizons H=1,7,14. We present a hybrid sequence model that combines multi-scale temporal convolutions, a gated recurrent module, and time-aware self-attention. The model is trained with standard regression losses and evaluated under MAE, RMSE, sMAPE, MASE, and Theil's U_2 with strict time-based splits to prevent leakage. We benchmark against ARIMA/Prophet, LSTM/GRU, LightGBM, and state-of-the-art Transformer forecasters (TFT, Informer, Autoformer, N-BEATS). Results show consistent accuracy gains and improved robustness on peak/holiday periods. We further provide ablations and statistical significance tests to ensure the reliability of improvements, and we release implementation details to facilitate reproducibility.

*Dora Krekovic,Mario Kusek,Ivana Podnar Zarko,Danh Le-Phuoc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an edge computing-based predictive algorithm to reduce IoT sensor data transmissions by only sending data when deviations exceed a set threshold, minimizing network congestion and energy use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies, high energy costs, and bandwidth constraints caused by continuous sensor data transmission, particularly in IoT and remote environments with limited resources.

Method: The approach uses a predictive filter at the edge to forecast data points and a cloud-based model for consistency. Transmission only occurs for deviations beyond a tolerance level. Simulations validate the algorithm.

Result: Results show significant reductions in communication overhead and energy consumption while maintaining system integrity. The system also supports cross-site generalization for scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is scalable, energy-efficient, and suitable for optimizing data transmission in resource-limited IoT applications, making it adaptable to various locations.

Abstract: The rapid growth of IoT devices has led to an enormous amount of sensor data that requires transmission to cloud servers for processing, resulting in excessive network congestion, increased latency and high energy consumption. This is particularly problematic in resource-constrained and remote environments where bandwidth is limited, and battery-dependent devices further emphasize the problem. Moreover, in domains such as agriculture, consecutive sensor readings often have minimal variation, making continuous data transmission inefficient and unnecessarily resource intensive. To overcome these challenges, we propose an analytical prediction algorithm designed for edge computing environments and validated through simulation. The proposed solution utilizes a predictive filter at the network edge that forecasts the next sensor data point and triggers data transmission only when the deviation from the predicted value exceeds a predefined tolerance. A complementary cloud-based model ensures data integrity and overall system consistency. This dual-model strategy effectively reduces communication overhead and demonstrates potential for improving energy efficiency by minimizing redundant transmissions. In addition to reducing communication load, our approach leverages both in situ and satellite observations from the same locations to enhance model robustness. It also supports cross-site generalization, enabling models trained in one region to be effectively deployed elsewhere without retraining. This makes our solution highly scalable, energy-aware, and well-suited for optimizing sensor data transmission in remote and bandwidth-constrained IoT environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction in aerospace systems, incorporating advanced hierarchical architecture and Bayesian modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in accurate RUL prediction and uncertainty quantification in aerospace applications, utilizing a novel approach not previously explored in CMAPSS-based literature.

Method: The framework employs hierarchical deep learning architectures combining Inception blocks, bidirectional LSTMs, attention mechanisms, Bayesian output layers for uncertainty estimation, and advanced preprocessing techniques.

Result: Experimental validation on NASA CMAPSS benchmarks shows superior performance, particularly in critical zones, with improved RMSE values and well-calibrated uncertainty measurements.

Conclusion: The research advances the RUL prediction field by achieving high performance in safety-critical scenarios and providing actionable uncertainty quantification, enabling improved risk-aware maintenance scheduling.

Abstract: Accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction coupled with uncertainty quantification remains a critical challenge in aerospace prognostics. This research introduces a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that learns aleatoric uncertainty directly through probabilistic modeling, an approach unexplored in existing CMAPSS-based literature. Our hierarchical architecture integrates multi-scale Inception blocks for temporal pattern extraction, bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequential modeling, and a dual-level attention mechanism operating simultaneously on sensor and temporal dimensions. The innovation lies in the Bayesian output layer that predicts both mean RUL and variance, enabling the model to learn data-inherent uncertainty. Comprehensive preprocessing employs condition-aware clustering, wavelet denoising, and intelligent feature selection. Experimental validation on NASA CMAPSS benchmarks (FD001-FD004) demonstrates competitive overall performance with RMSE values of 16.22, 19.29, 16.84, and 19.98 respectively. Remarkably, our framework achieves breakthrough critical zone performance (RUL <= 30 cycles) with RMSE of 5.14, 6.89, 5.27, and 7.16, representing 25-40 percent improvements over conventional approaches and establishing new benchmarks for safety-critical predictions. The learned uncertainty provides well-calibrated 95 percent confidence intervals with coverage ranging from 93.5 percent to 95.2 percent, enabling risk-aware maintenance scheduling previously unattainable in CMAPSS literature.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing recipe recommendation systems effectively using multimodal data beyond simple user-recipe interactions.

Method: Utilizes a 3-stage framework combining foundation models, message propagation, and contrastive learning.

Result: TESMR achieves 7-15% higher Recall@10 on real-world datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Systematic enhancement of multimodal signals is highly effective, making TESMR a promising solution for recipe recommendation systems.

Abstract: Recipe recommendation has become an essential task in web-based food platforms. A central challenge is effectively leveraging rich multimodal features beyond user-recipe interactions. Our analysis shows that even simple uses of multimodal signals yield competitive performance, suggesting that systematic enhancement of these signals is highly promising. We propose TESMR, a 3-stage framework for recipe recommendation that progressively refines raw multimodal features into effective embeddings through: (1) content-based enhancement using foundation models with multimodal comprehension, (2) relation-based enhancement via message propagation over user-recipe interactions, and (3) learning-based enhancement through contrastive learning with learnable embeddings. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that TESMR outperforms existing methods, achieving 7-15% higher Recall@10.

*Minxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of standard MAB algorithms in non-stationary environments by introducing FDSW-UCB, a dual-view algorithm utilizing both long-term and short-term perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms like UCB struggle to perform in dynamic, non-stationary reward environments. There is a need for models that adapt effectively to changes over time.

Method: The paper proposes FDSW-UCB, combining discount-based long-term views with sliding-window-based short-term views, tested using semi-synthetic simulations derived from MovieLens-1M and Open Bandit datasets.

Result: Experimental results reveal that SW-UCB is robust in dynamic environments, D-UCB suffers from linear regret, and FDSW-UCB with optimistic aggregation performs best in evolving scenarios.

Conclusion: FDSW-UCB offers substantial improvement for bandit problems in non-stationary settings, emphasizing the importance of ensemble strategies in achieving adaptability and superior performance.

Abstract: Many real-world bandit problems involve non-stationary reward distributions, where the optimal decision may shift due to evolving environments. However, the performance of some typical Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) models such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms degrades significantly in non-stationary environments where reward distributions change over time. To address this limitation, this paper introduces and evaluates FDSW-UCB, a novel dual-view algorithm that integrates a discount-based long-term perspective with a sliding-window-based short-term view. A data-driven semi-synthetic simulation platform, built upon the MovieLens-1M and Open Bandit datasets, is developed to test algorithm adaptability under abrupt and gradual drift scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that a well-configured sliding-window mechanism (SW-UCB) is robust, while the widely used discounting method (D-UCB) suffers from a fundamental learning failure, leading to linear regret. Crucially, the proposed FDSW-UCB, when employing an optimistic aggregation strategy, achieves superior performance in dynamic settings, highlighting that the ensemble strategy itself is a decisive factor for success.

### [666] [MAESTRO: Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19253)
*Boyuan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAESTRO, a novel framework for improving cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by using Large Language Models (LLMs) for offline training to create curricula and rewards. It improves performance without additional inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooperative MARL struggles with reward function design and avoiding local optima during training in complex environments. Current solutions either depend on heuristics or costly real-time use of LLMs.

Method: MAESTRO shifts LLM usage offline and employs it as a training architect through two components: a semantic curriculum generator creating diverse tasks and an automated reward synthesizer adjusting rewards for curriculum difficulty.

Result: The framework was tested on real-world traffic signal control tasks. Results showed improved performance (+4.0% higher mean return) and risk-adjusted stability (+2.2% better Sharpe ratio) compared to existing baselines, using LLM-guided curriculum and reward shaping.

Conclusion: MAESTRO demonstrated LLMs' ability to effectively guide cooperative MARL training, offering performance and stability benefits without increasing deployment inference cost.

Abstract: Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces two major design bottlenecks: crafting dense reward functions and constructing curricula that avoid local optima in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments. Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline. These findings highlight LLMs as effective high-level designers for cooperative MARL training.

*Lucas Li,Jean-Baptiste Puel,Florence Carton,Dounya Barrit,Jhony H. Giraldo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Solar-GECO, a geometric-aware co-attention model for predicting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells, outperforming previous models by leveraging geometric and text-based data integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the inefficiencies in experimental-based materials screening and the limitations of existing machine learning models that fail to capture geometric information of perovskite crystals.

Method: The authors propose Solar-GECO, which merges a geometric graph neural network encoding perovskite atomic structures with language model embeddings for textual chemical data. A co-attention module is also introduced to capture layer dependencies, and probabilistic regression is used for PCE prediction.

Result: Solar-GECO achieved state-of-the-art performance, reducing the MAE for PCE prediction from 3.066 to 2.936, outperforming prior models like semantic GNN.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that leveraging both geometric and textual information in Solar-GECO provides a powerful framework for accurately predicting the PCE of perovskite solar cells, with broader implications for multi-scale solar cell design.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells are promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. However, their performance as multi-scale devices is determined by complex interactions between their constituent layers. This creates a vast combinatorial space of possible materials and device architectures, making the conventional experimental-based screening process slow and expensive. Machine learning models try to address this problem, but they only focus on individual material properties or neglect the important geometric information of the perovskite crystal. To address this problem, we propose to predict perovskite solar cell power conversion efficiency with a geometric-aware co-attention (Solar-GECO) model. Solar-GECO combines a geometric graph neural network (GNN) - that directly encodes the atomic structure of the perovskite absorber - with language model embeddings that process the textual strings representing the chemical compounds of the transport layers and other device components. Solar-GECO also integrates a co-attention module to capture intra-layer dependencies and inter-layer interactions, while a probabilistic regression head predicts both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and its associated uncertainty. Solar-GECO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming several baselines, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) for PCE prediction from 3.066 to 2.936 compared to semantic GNN (the previous state-of-the-art model). Solar-GECO demonstrates that integrating geometric and textual information provides a more powerful and accurate framework for PCE prediction.

TL;DR: The paper presents an interpretability framework for SynFlowNet, a generative flow network for molecular design, aiming to make its decision-making process transparent for better adoption in drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opaque nature of decision policies in GFlowNets limits their adoption for molecular design in sensitive fields like drug discovery, which demands interpretability and clear rationale for proposed molecular structures.

Method: The authors developed an interpretability framework incorporating gradient-based saliency with counterfactual perturbations, sparse autoencoders for axis-aligned latent factors, and motif probes to uncover functional group encodings.

Result: The framework shows how SynFlowNet decision-making aligns with physicochemical properties, molecular outcomes, and functional group encodings, offering transparency in its processes.

Conclusion: This interpretability framework enhances the transparency and control of SynFlowNet, making it better suited for applications in transparent and mechanistic molecular design.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks, or GFlowNets, offer a promising framework for molecular design, but their internal decision policies remain opaque. This limits adoption in drug discovery, where chemists require clear and interpretable rationales for proposed structures. We present an interpretability framework for SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet trained on documented chemical reactions and purchasable starting materials that generates both molecules and the synthetic routes that produce them. Our approach integrates three complementary components. Gradient based saliency combined with counterfactual perturbations identifies which atomic environments influence reward and how structural edits change molecular outcomes. Sparse autoencoders reveal axis aligned latent factors that correspond to physicochemical properties such as polarity, lipophilicity, and molecular size. Motif probes show that functional groups including aromatic rings and halogens are explicitly encoded and linearly decodable from the internal embeddings. Together, these results expose the chemical logic inside SynFlowNet and provide actionable and mechanistic insight that supports transparent and controllable molecular design.

Conclusion: MI can lead to a scientific understanding of machine learning systems by treating them as objects for study and understanding, beyond task-solving tools.

Abstract: The black box nature of deep neural networks poses a significant challenge for the deployment of transparent and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) systems. With the growing presence of AI in society, it becomes increasingly important to develop methods that can explain and interpret the decisions made by these systems. To address this, mechanistic interpretability (MI) emerged as a promising and distinctive research program within the broader field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). MI is the process of studying the inner computations of neural networks and translating them into human-understandable algorithms. It encompasses reverse engineering techniques aimed at uncovering the computational algorithms implemented by neural networks. In this article, we propose a unified taxonomy of MI approaches and provide a detailed analysis of key techniques, illustrated with concrete examples and pseudo-code. We contextualize MI within the broader interpretability landscape, comparing its goals, methods, and insights to other strands of XAI. Additionally, we trace the development of MI as a research area, highlighting its conceptual roots and the accelerating pace of recent work. We argue that MI holds significant potential to support a more scientific understanding of machine learning systems -- treating models not only as tools for solving tasks, but also as systems to be studied and understood. We hope to invite new researchers into the field of mechanistic interpretability.

Motivation: To explore whether relational structures modeled through spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks can enhance forecasting accuracy in interconnected retail stores.

Method: The study employs STGNN to predict sales using an adaptive graph representing inter-store dependencies, leveraging weekly sales data from 45 Walmart stores.

Result: STGNN achieved the lowest forecasting error and uncovered meaningful store clusters and influential nodes, outperforming traditional models like ARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost.

Conclusion: Relational modeling with STGNNs significantly improves the forecasting of retail sales across interconnected stores, establishing its robustness in multi-store demand prediction.

Abstract: This work evaluates the effectiveness of spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for multi-store retail sales forecasting and compares their performance against ARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost baselines. Using weekly sales data from 45 Walmart stores, we construct a relational forecasting framework that models inter-store dependencies through a learned adaptive graph. The proposed STGNN predicts log-differenced sales and reconstructs final values through a residual path, enabling stable training and improved generalisation. Experiments show that STGNN achieves the lowest overall forecasting error, outperforming all baselines in Normalised Total Absolute Error, P90 MAPE, and variance of MAPE across stores. Analysis of the learned adjacency matrix reveals meaningful functional store clusters and high-influence nodes that emerge without geographic metadata. These results demonstrate that relational structure significantly improves forecast quality in interconnected retail environments and establishes STGNNs as a robust modelling choice for multi-store demand prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a time series foundation model that is resource-efficient in training while delivering state-of-the-art results, particularly for resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: The model uses synthetic data generation (SynthTS), data augmentation, causal input normalization, and training on a single A100 GPU.

Result: Tiny-TSM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmark datasets, surpassing larger models for medium- and long-term forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: Tiny-TSM demonstrates that small-scale models, with efficient training techniques, can achieve competitive or superior time series analysis results compared to larger models and tuned systems.

Abstract: We present Tiny-TSM, a time series foundation model characterized by small scale, economical training, and state-of-the-art performance. It comprises 23M total parameters, trained on a single A100 GPU in less than a week using a new synthetic data generation and data augmentation pipeline (SynthTS). Without any neural architecture search, hyperparameter tuning, or scaling up model size, Tiny-TSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of time series benchmark datasets, often outperforming much larger models and even matching the performance of much larger, industrial-scale, likely highly tuned foundation models. Specifically, Tiny-TSM outperforms all other time series foundation models we evaluated on medium- and long-term forecasting tasks under MSE loss, while short-term accuracy is still competitive with state-of-the-art models.
  We also introduce a causal input normalization scheme that enables time series models to be trained with dense next-token prediction loss, significantly accelerating convergence speed and reducing training time.
  All experiments were conducted on a single A100 GPU, illustrating the practicality of the proposed approach in a resource-constrained setting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a faster method using Tsetlin Machines for Bayesian structure learning to address the inefficiencies of the PC algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The PC algorithm faces significant time complexity issues, limiting its use for large-scale datasets. Addressing this inefficiency is critical for making causal inference feasible for real-world problems.

Method: The study uses Tsetlin Machines to identify key literals and conducts conditional independence tests only on these subsets, thereby reducing computational demands.

Result: The TM-based method significantly reduces computational time while maintaining accuracy for causal discovery.

Conclusion: The proposed TM-based approach offers a more computationally efficient alternative to the PC algorithm without compromising accuracy, suitable for large-scale applications.

Abstract: The PC algorithm is a widely used method in causal inference for learning the structure of Bayesian networks. Despite its popularity, the PC algorithm suffers from significant time complexity, particularly as the size of the dataset increases, which limits its applicability in large-scale real-world problems. In this study, we propose a novel approach that utilises the Tsetlin Machine (TM) to construct Bayesian structures more efficiently. Our method leverages the most significant literals extracted from the TM and performs conditional independence (CI) tests on these selected literals instead of the full set of variables, resulting in a considerable reduction in computational time. We implemented our approach and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Our evaluation includes categorical datasets from the bnlearn repository, such as Munin1, Hepar2. The findings indicate that the proposed TM-based method not only reduces computational complexity but also maintains competitive accuracy in causal discovery, making it a viable alternative to traditional PC algorithm implementations by offering improved efficiency without compromising performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address gaps in emissions datasets, such as lack of accuracy, global coverage, high resolution, and timely updates, enhancing their utility for effective monitoring and mitigation actions.

Method: The paper describes Climate TRACE, a platform synthesizing existing emissions data with sector-specific approaches to fill gaps, offering monthly global emissions estimates for individual sources across all sectors.

Result: The result is the first-ever globally comprehensive dataset of emissions at the level of individual sources, updating monthly with a short reporting lag.

Conclusion: Climate TRACE represents a major milestone in emissions accounting, facilitating detailed and accessible data for driving informed climate mitigation efforts worldwide.

Abstract: Global greenhouse gas emissions estimates are essential for monitoring and mitigation planning. Yet most datasets lack one or more characteristics that enhance their actionability, such as accuracy, global coverage, high spatial and temporal resolution, and frequent updates. To address these gaps, we present Climate TRACE (climatetrace.org), an open-access platform delivering global emissions estimates with enhanced detail, coverage, and timeliness. Climate TRACE synthesizes existing emissions data, prioritizing accuracy, coverage, and resolution, and fills gaps using sector-specific estimation approaches. The dataset is the first to provide globally comprehensive emissions estimates for individual sources (e.g., individual power plants) for all anthropogenic emitting sectors. The dataset spans January 1, 2021, to the present, with a two-month reporting lag and monthly updates. The open-access platform enables non-technical audiences to engage with detailed emissions datasets for most subnational governments worldwide. Climate TRACE supports data-driven climate action at scales where decisions are made, representing a major breakthrough for emissions accounting and mitigation.

*James R. M. Black,Moritz S. Hanke,Aaron Maiwald,Tina Hernandez-Boussard,Oliver M. Crook,Jaspreet Pannu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of filtering pretraining data to mitigate risks from genomic language models (gLMs). By fine-tuning a state-of-the-art gLM with harmful viral sequences, misuse-relevant capabilities can be partially restored, highlighting challenges in ensuring the safe use of such models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and evaluate concerns regarding the misuse potential of genomic language models (gLMs) for tasks involving harmful viral genomes, and to assess the resilience of data filtering measures.

Method: The study fine-tuned a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, using human-infecting viral sequences to test its predictive capabilities. Comparisons were made to both the pretrained model and a model fine-tuned with non-human virus sequences.

Result: Fine-tuning with human-infecting viral sequences restored predictive capabilities, reducing perplexity for unseen viral sequences and identifying immune escape variants in SARS-CoV-2 (AUROC of 0.6).

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that filtering training data may not fully prevent potential misuse of gLMs, as fine-tuning can reinstate certain capabilities. It calls for better safety frameworks and mitigation strategies for gLM deployment.

Abstract: Novel deep learning architectures are increasingly being applied to biological data, including genetic sequences. These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences. The model fine-tuned on human-infecting viruses also identified immune escape variants from SARS-CoV-2 (achieving an AUROC of 0.6), despite having no expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2 sequences during fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that data exclusion might be circumvented by fine-tuning approaches that can, to some degree, rescue misuse-relevant capabilities of gLMs. We highlight the need for safety frameworks for gLMs and outline further work needed on evaluations and mitigation measures to enable the safe deployment of gLMs.

TL;DR: This paper examines how transformers learn latent structures using the Alchemy benchmark, showing discrete learning stages and identifying challenges in decomposing complex examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand how transformers acquire latent structures and their dynamics during learning, which remains poorly comprehended.

Method: The study used a decoder-only transformer trained on three task variants: inferring partial rules, combining rules for multi-step sequences, and decomposing complex examples into intermediate steps.

Result: The model learned latent capabilities in stages, mastering coarse rules first before acquiring complete structures, but revealed difficulty in decomposing complex examples.

Conclusion: Transformers learn latent structures in progressive, interpretable stages, offering insights into training dynamics and limitations in handling complex tasks.

Abstract: While transformers can discover latent structure from context, the dynamics of how they acquire different components of the latent structure remain poorly understood. In this work, we use the Alchemy benchmark, to investigate the dynamics of latent structure learning. We train a small decoder-only transformer on three task variants: 1) inferring missing rules from partial contextual information, 2) composing simple rules to solve multi-step sequences, and 3) decomposing complex multi-step examples to infer intermediate steps. By factorizing each task into interpretable events, we show that the model acquires capabilities in discrete stages, first learning the coarse grained rules, before learning the complete latent structure. We also identify a crucial asymmetry, where the model can compose fundamental rules robustly, but struggles to decompose complex examples to discover the fundamental rules. These findings offer new insights into understanding how a transformer model learns latent structures, providing a granular view of how these capabilities evolve during training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores novel adversarial attack methods targeting time-series forecasting models, particularly in financial data, through slope-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks on deep learning are well-studied in image domains but lack extensive research in time-series applications, especially for financial forecasts.

Method: Introducing two slope-based adversarial attack methods (General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack) to alter the trends predicted by the N-HiTS model, alongside integration with GAN for synthetic data generation.

Result: The slope-based attacks doubled prediction slopes and bypassed security mechanisms, drastically reducing a CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks can manipulate and compromise financial forecasting, highlighting the need to secure both models and their pipelines.

Abstract: A common method of attacking deep learning models is through adversarial attacks, which occur when an attacker specifically modifies the input of a model to produce an incorrect result. Adversarial attacks have been deeply investigated in the image domain; however, there is less research in the time-series domain and very little for forecasting financial data. To address these concerns, this study aims to build upon previous research on adversarial attacks for time-series data by introducing two new slope-based methods aimed to alter the trends of the predicted stock forecast generated by an N-HiTS model. Compared to the normal N-HiTS predictions, the two new slope-based methods, the General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack, can manipulate N-HiTS predictions by doubling the slope. These new slope attacks can bypass standard security mechanisms, such as a discriminator that filters real and perturbed inputs, reducing a 4-layered CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%. Furthermore, the slope based methods were incorporated into a GAN architecture as a means of generating realistic synthetic data, while simultaneously fooling the model. Finally, this paper also proposes a sample malware designed to inject an adversarial attack in the model inference library, proving that ML-security research should not only focus on making the model safe, but also securing the entire pipeline.

### [677] [Annotation-Free Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19344)
*Hari Chandana Kuchibhotla,K S Ananth,Vineeth N Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Annotation-Free Class-Incremental Learning (AFCIL), where models learn incrementally from unlabeled data using a novel Cross Domain World Guided framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning relies on labeled data, but real-world scenarios often lack annotations. This paper addresses the gap in learning settings without labels, where tasks emerge incrementally over time.

Method: The authors propose CrossWorld CL, a framework that uses external world knowledge, semantic alignment with ImageNet classes, and a novel replay strategy to support learning without annotations.

Result: CrossWorld CL outperforms CLIP and existing continual and unsupervised learning methods across four datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating world knowledge enables effective continual learning in challenging annotation-free settings.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in continual learning ranging from architectural novelty to clever strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting most existing methods rest on a strong but unrealistic assumption the availability of labeled data throughout the learning process. In real-world scenarios, however, data often arrives sequentially and without annotations, rendering conventional approaches impractical. In this work, we revisit the fundamental assumptions of continual learning and ask: Can current systems adapt when labels are absent and tasks emerge incrementally over time? To this end, we introduce Annotation-Free Class-Incremental Learning (AFCIL), a more realistic and challenging paradigm where unlabeled data arrives continuously, and the learner must incrementally acquire new classes without any supervision. To enable effective learning under AFCIL, we propose CrossWorld CL, a Cross Domain World Guided Continual Learning framework that incorporates external world knowledge as a stable auxiliary source. The method retrieves semantically related ImageNet classes for each downstream category, maps downstream and ImageNet features through a cross domain alignment strategy and finally introduce a novel replay strategy. This design lets the model uncover semantic structure without annotations while keeping earlier knowledge intact. Across four datasets, CrossWorld-CL surpasses CLIP baselines and existing continual and unlabeled learning methods, underscoring the benefit of world knowledge for annotation free continual learning.

### [678] [Enhancing Conformal Prediction via Class Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19359)
*Ariel Fargion,Lahav Dabah,Tom Tirer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a strategy to improve Conformal Prediction (CP) by incorporating class similarity, reducing prediction set size while maintaining reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal Prediction methods, while providing reliable classification, often generate unnecessarily large prediction sets. This becomes problematic when classes can be grouped semantically, as users prefer predictions limited to fewer semantically distinct groups.

Method: The paper introduces an augmentation to the CP score function by penalizing out-of-group errors based on class partitioning. This strategy is theoretically analyzed and developed into a model-specific, human-annotation-free variant for broader application.

Result: The proposed methodology consistently reduces prediction set sizes and improves group-related prediction metrics, as shown through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical tests across various CP methods, models, and datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating class similarity enhances CP methods by optimizing prediction efficiency and accuracy. This approach is generalizable, easy to implement, and significantly beneficial in semantically structured setups.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a powerful statistical framework for high-stakes classification applications. Instead of predicting a single class, CP generates a prediction set, guaranteed to include the true label with a pre-specified probability. The performance of different CP methods is typically assessed by their average prediction set size. In setups where the classes can be partitioned into semantic groups, e.g., diseases that require similar treatment, users can benefit from prediction sets that are not only small on average, but also contain a small number of semantically different groups. This paper begins by addressing this problem and ultimately offers a widely applicable tool for boosting any CP method on any dataset. First, given a class partition, we propose augmenting the CP score function with a term that penalizes predictions with out-of-group errors. We theoretically analyze this strategy and prove its advantages for group-related metrics. Surprisingly, we show mathematically that, for common class partitions, it can also reduce the average set size of any CP score function. Our analysis reveals the class similarity factors behind this improvement and motivates us to propose a model-specific variant, which does not require any human semantic partition and can further reduce the prediction set size. Finally, we present an extensive empirical study, encompassing prominent CP methods, multiple models, and several datasets, which demonstrates that our class-similarity-based approach consistently enhances CP methods.

*Carlos Ruiz-Gonzalez,Sören Arlt,Sebastian Lehner,Arturs Berzins,Yehonathan Drori,Rana X Adhikari,Johannes Brandstetter,Mario Krenn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural surrogate models are proposed to speed up physics simulations without compromising accuracy. The approach efficiently outperforms traditional optimization methods, demonstrated through gravitational wave detector design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CPU-based simulators are computationally expensive for complex systems and experimental designs, limiting optimization and exploration in science and engineering.

Method: A neural network surrogate model is trained to replicate the simulator's output. The algorithm alternates between surrogate training, inverse design experiments, and verification for further refinement, utilizing auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism.

Result: The model significantly accelerates the evaluation of experimental designs and outperforms traditional optimization, identifying high-quality designs faster and with greater efficiency.

Conclusion: Neural surrogate models enable faster, more efficient optimization of complex experimental systems, making them broadly applicable beyond gravitational wave detector design.

Abstract: Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes RELED, a MARL framework combining expert demonstrations and autonomous exploration to address non-stationarity in multi-agent reinforcement learning, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of non-stationarity in MARL which cause unstable training and poor convergence as the number of agents increases.

Method: RELED introduces a Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration module to improve LLM-generated trajectories and a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module to balance expert and agent interactions, enhancing training stability and policy convergence.

Result: Experiments using real city networks show RELED outperforms other state-of-the-art MARL methods.

Conclusion: RELED successfully combines expert demonstrations and agent exploration, improving MARL's scalability, stability, and agent policy performance.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been increasingly adopted in many real-world applications. While MARL enables decentralized deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, it suffers from severe non-stationarity due to the synchronous updates of agent policies. This non stationarity results in unstable training and poor policy con vergence, especially as the number of agents increases. In this paper, we propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven expert demonstrations with autonomous agent exploration. RELED incorporates a Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration module, which leverages theoretical non-stationarity bounds to enhance the quality of LLM-generated expert trajectories, thus providing high reward and training-stable samples for each agent. Moreover, a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module adaptively balances each agent's learning from both expert-generated and agent-generated trajectories, accelerating policy convergence and improving generalization. Extensive experiments with real city networks based on OpenStreetMap demonstrate that RELED achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MARL methods.

### [681] [Efficiency vs. Fidelity: A Comparative Analysis of Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Flow Matching on Low-Resource Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19379)
*Srishti Gupta,Yashasvee Taiwade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) with Flow Matching. It concludes that Flow Matching is more computationally efficient and geometrically optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The objective is to address the high computational overhead of DDPMs during inference, making them unsuitable for low-resource or real-time applications.

Method: A shared Time-Conditioned U-Net is employed to test DDPMs and Flow Matching on the MNIST dataset. Key evaluations include geometric analysis and numerical sensitivity for efficiency comparison.

Result: Flow Matching significantly outperforms DDPMs, showing near-optimal transport paths and lower curvature (1.02 vs. 3.45). Flow Matching maintains image fidelity under stricter computational limits.

Conclusion: Flow Matching is preferable for resource-constrained applications due to its efficiency and ability to use lightweight solvers like Euler without quality loss.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have established a new state-of-the-art in generative image synthesis, yet their deployment is hindered by significant computational overhead during inference, often requiring up to 1,000 iterative steps. This study presents a rigorous comparative analysis of DDPMs against the emerging Flow Matching (Rectified Flow) paradigm, specifically isolating their geometric and efficiency properties on low-resource hardware. By implementing both frameworks on a shared Time-Conditioned U-Net backbone using the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that Flow Matching significantly outperforms Diffusion in efficiency. Our geometric analysis reveals that Flow Matching learns a highly rectified transport path (Curvature $\mathcal{C} \approx 1.02$), which is near-optimal, whereas Diffusion trajectories remain stochastic and tortuous ($\mathcal{C} \approx 3.45$). Furthermore, we establish an ``efficiency frontier'' at $N=10$ function evaluations, where Flow Matching retains high fidelity while Diffusion collapses. Finally, we show via numerical sensitivity analysis that the learned vector field is sufficiently linear to render high-order ODE solvers (Runge-Kutta 4) unnecessary, validating the use of lightweight Euler solvers for edge deployment. \textbf{This work concludes that Flow Matching is the superior algorithmic choice for real-time, resource-constrained generative tasks.}

*Dereck Piche,Mohammed Muqeeth,Milad Aghajohari,Juan Duque,Michael Noukhovitch,Aaron Courville*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores multi-agent interactions and proposes a reinforcement learning adaptation called Advantage Alignment to improve collaboration and prevent exploitation among large language model (LLM) agents in social dilemmas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge posed by multi-agent interactions, particularly in social dilemmas where individual incentives can harm collective welfare. The problem is compounded by prior findings that RL in multi-agent settings often leads to self-interested behaviors.

Method: The authors adapt an opponent-learning algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to train LLM agents, incorporating a group-relative baseline to simplify computation for iterated games. They also design a new social dilemma environment called Trust and Split.

Result: The proposed method leads to policies that achieve higher collective payoffs and remain resistant to exploitation by greedy agents across various social dilemma settings.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning combined with Advantage Alignment successfully enhances cooperative behaviors in multi-agent systems, aligning LLM-based agents to balance both collective welfare and individual robustness.

Abstract: As agentic AI becomes more widespread, agents with distinct and possibly conflicting goals will interact in complex ways. These multi-agent interactions pose a fundamental challenge, particularly in social dilemmas, where agents' individual incentives can undermine collective welfare. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for aligning large language models (LLMs) in the single-agent regime, prior small-network results suggest that standard RL in multi-agent settings often converges to defecting, self-interested policies. We show the same effect in LLMs: despite cooperative priors, RL-trained LLM agents develop opportunistic behavior that can exploit even advanced closed-source models. To address this tendency of RL to converge to poor equilibria, we adapt a recent opponent-learning awareness algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to fine-tune LLMs toward multi-agent cooperation and non-exploitability. We then introduce a group-relative baseline that simplifies advantage computation in iterated games, enabling multi-agent training at LLM scale. We also contribute a novel social dilemma environment, Trust and Split, which requires natural language communication to achieve high collective welfare. Across a wide range of social dilemmas, policies learned with Advantage Alignment achieve higher collective payoffs while remaining robust against exploitation by greedy agents.

*Zhaolong Su,Wang Lu,Hao Chen,Sharon Li,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses the inconsistency in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) with UniGame, a lightweight self-adversarial post-training framework improving multimodal performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inconsistencies in UMMs, particularly in compact embeddings for understanding vs. reconstruction-rich representations for generation, which lead to misalignments and vulnerabilities.

Method: Introduced UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training approach using a perturber at the token interface to challenge fragile understanding during generation.

Result: UniGame improved consistency by 4.6%, understanding by 3.6%, generation by 0.02, and robustness in out-of-distribution/adversarial tests by 4.8% and 6.2% respectively.

Conclusion: Adversarial self-play is a versatile and effective strategy that enhances the stability, coherence, and unified capabilities of multimodal foundation models. The method is lightweight and architecture-independent.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown impressive performance in both understanding and generation with a single architecture. However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

### [684] [Flow Map Distillation Without Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19428)
*Shangyuan Tong,Nanye Ma,Saining Xie,Tommi Jaakkola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for flow map distillation from generative models without relying on external datasets, addressing the risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch by sampling solely from the prior distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-dependency in flow map distillation presents a risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch, possibly misaligning with the teacher model's generative capabilities.

Method: The proposed method uses the teacher's prior distribution to predict the sampling path and actively correct errors to achieve high fidelity without external data.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with impressive FID scores of 1.45 for ImageNet 256x256 and 1.49 for ImageNet 512x512 using only one sampling step.

Conclusion: Flow map distillation can be successfully achieved without external data, leading to faster generative modeling and addressing significant risks in existing methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art flow models achieve remarkable quality but require slow, iterative sampling. To accelerate this, flow maps can be distilled from pre-trained teachers, a procedure that conventionally requires sampling from an external dataset. We argue that this data-dependency introduces a fundamental risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch, as a static dataset may provide an incomplete or even misaligned representation of the teacher's full generative capabilities. This leads us to question whether this reliance on data is truly necessary for successful flow map distillation. In this work, we explore a data-free alternative that samples only from the prior distribution, a distribution the teacher is guaranteed to follow by construction, thereby circumventing the mismatch risk entirely. To demonstrate the practical viability of this philosophy, we introduce a principled framework that learns to predict the teacher's sampling path while actively correcting for its own compounding errors to ensure high fidelity. Our approach surpasses all data-based counterparts and establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin. Specifically, distilling from SiT-XL/2+REPA, our method reaches an impressive FID of 1.45 on ImageNet 256x256, and 1.49 on ImageNet 512x512, both with only 1 sampling step. We hope our work establishes a more robust paradigm for accelerating generative models and motivates the broader adoption of flow map distillation without data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BOOD uses diffusion models to generate synthetic OOD data, improving detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulty of identifying decision boundaries in the latent space to generate effective out-of-distribution data.

Method: BOOD perturbs latent features near decision boundaries using text-conditioned space and applies diffusion models to produce synthetic OOD images.

Result: BOOD significantly improves metrics, reducing FPR95 by 29.64% and increasing AUROC by 7.27% on CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: BOOD generates human-compatible, high-quality OOD data efficiently, enhancing understanding of outlier detection.

Abstract: Harnessing the power of diffusion models to synthesize auxiliary training data based on latent space features has proven effective in enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, extracting effective features outside the in-distribution (ID) boundary in latent space remains challenging due to the difficulty of identifying decision boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a novel framework called Boundary-based Out-Of-Distribution data generation (BOOD), which synthesizes high-quality OOD features and generates human-compatible outlier images using diffusion models. BOOD first learns a text-conditioned latent feature space from the ID dataset, selects ID features closest to the decision boundary, and perturbs them to cross the decision boundary to form OOD features. These synthetic OOD features are then decoded into images in pixel space by a diffusion model. Compared to previous works, BOOD provides a more training efficient strategy for synthesizing informative OOD features, facilitating clearer distinctions between ID and OOD data. Extensive experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that BOOD surpasses the state-of-the-art method significantly, achieving a 29.64% decrease in average FPR95 (40.31% vs. 10.67%) and a 7.27% improvement in average AUROC (90.15% vs. 97.42%) on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation flow-matching models have potential as universal priors for inverse problems but currently underperform compared to domain-specific approaches.

Method: FMPlug utilizes an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy and Gaussianity regularization to enhance FM models for inverse problems.

Result: FMPlug significantly boosts performance in image restoration and scientific inverse problems.

Conclusion: Foundation flow-matching models can be practical, reusable priors for solving inverse problems with FMPlug's improvements.

Abstract: Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a genetic algorithm to optimize fantasy football trades, ensuring fairness and improved playoff performance for all parties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches do not explore automated trade generation in fantasy football, which remains an underexplored area despite its complex dynamics.

Method: A genetic algorithm is proposed, using custom mutation techniques and a cost function considering playoff-weighted gains, fairness, and ESPN-based real-time data integration.

Result: On a 12-team ESPN league in Week 8, 2025, the algorithm improved projected point totals for both the initiator and partner by nearly 3 fantasy points per week.

Conclusion: The algorithm effectively optimizes trades, maintains fairness, and can extend to other combinatorial sports problems, with an open-source implementation for further research.

Abstract: Fantasy football leagues involve strategic player trades to optimize team performance. However, identifying optimal trades is complex due to varying player projections, positional needs, and league-specific scoring. Existing approaches focus on team selection or lineup optimization, but automated trade generation remains underexplored. In this paper, an algorithm that generates optimal trades, biasing toward improved playoff performance while maintaining apparent fairness for negotiation is explored. We introduce a genetic algorithm for fantasy football trade optimization, building on existing frameworks for team selection and lineup generation. The algorithm initializes with single-player trades, evolves through custom mutations (add/remove players, combine trades, exchange players, add from other trades, and spawn new trades), and uses team-specific elitism to preserve diversity. The cost function incorporates a playoff-weighted gain for the user's team (while maintaining apparent fairness), opponent gain, and fairness penalty. Integration with ESPN data sources enables real-time projections for all positions, including kickers and defenses. On a 12-team ESPN league (Week 8, 2025), the algorithm generated trades that upgraded the projected point totals of both the trade initiator and trade partner by nearly 3 fantasy points per week ensuring positive gains for both teams. The algorithm demonstrates effective trade optimization, with potential extensions to other fantasy sports or combinatorial problems requiring temporal biasing. Open-source implementation enables practical use and further research.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Boolean neural network framework that operates on Boolean fields using logic gates to process image data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To propose an efficient and interpretable network for high-speed image processing, leveraging Boolean logic for improved hardware performance and universal expressivity.

Method: The framework uses a Boolean reaction-diffusion mechanism alongside a Boolean self-attention mechanism, implementing Boolean Query-Key attention and Boolean Rotary Position Embedding. Differentiable training is achieved via continuous relaxation techniques.

Result: The network demonstrates universal expressivity and hardware efficiency while replicating convolutional and attention mechanisms, making it suitable for high-speed and interpretable AI in digital hardware.

Conclusion: The Boolean neural network offers interpretability, efficiency, and potential for hardware-accelerated image processing, with promising applications and future research opportunities.

Abstract: This paper presents a gate-level Boolean evolutionary geometric attention neural network that models images as Boolean fields governed by logic gates. Each pixel is a Boolean variable (0 or 1) embedded on a two-dimensional geometric manifold (for example, a discrete toroidal lattice), which defines adjacency and information propagation among pixels. The network updates image states through a Boolean reaction-diffusion mechanism: pixels receive Boolean diffusion from neighboring pixels (diffusion process) and perform local logic updates via trainable gate-level logic kernels (reaction process), forming a reaction-diffusion logic network.
  A Boolean self-attention mechanism is introduced, using XNOR-based Boolean Query-Key (Q-K) attention to modulate neighborhood diffusion pathways and realize logic attention. We also propose Boolean Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which encodes relative distances by parity-bit flipping to simulate Boolean ``phase'' offsets.
  The overall structure resembles a Transformer but operates entirely in the Boolean domain. Trainable parameters include Q-K pattern bits and gate-level kernel configurations. Because outputs are discrete, continuous relaxation methods (such as sigmoid approximation or soft-logic operators) ensure differentiable training.
  Theoretical analysis shows that the network achieves universal expressivity, interpretability, and hardware efficiency, capable of reproducing convolutional and attention mechanisms. Applications include high-speed image processing, interpretable artificial intelligence, and digital hardware acceleration, offering promising future research directions.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper examines the bias in two optimization algorithms (STOA and TSA) and identifies design flaws due to specific mathematical operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overstated claims and unexplained biases in STOA and TSA algorithms by analyzing their behavior.

Method: The study employs a probabilistic analysis to pinpoint the source of bias within the algorithms, focusing on exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and random number operations.

Result: It was found that certain mathematical operations cause biased probability distributions, resulting in a shift towards zero.

Conclusion: The paper advises caution in applying STOA and TSA, as their design flaws lead to potential limitations in practical use.

Abstract: In the article (Kudela, 2022), experimental demonstrations indicated that two Bio-/Nature inspired optimization algorithms (BNIOAs), Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA) and Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA), exhibit a zero-bias, leading to the conclusion that the claims made in the original papers were overstated. In this work, we extend the analysis by investigating the source of this bias from a probabilistic perspective. Our findings suggest that operations involving exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and divisions between random numbers are the primary causes of design flaws. These operations result in probability density distributions with a noticeable shift toward zero. Therefore, the application of these two algorithms should be approached with due caution.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper critiques the Exponential Trigonometric Optimizer (ETO) by identifying structural flaws in its design and its inflated performance claims, urging reforms in metaheuristic research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address issues of inflated claims, opacity, and statistical misuse in new metaheuristic algorithms such as ETO.

Method: The study involves algorithmic reconstruction, benchmarking ETO against nine metaheuristics, and employing statistical tests to analyze performance.

Result: ETO is found to be mid-tier competitive but performs poorly against top-tier metaheuristics, especially in challenging optimization scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper calls for improved practices in metaheuristic development, focusing on symbolic clarity, proper operator design, and transparent statistical reporting to enhance literature reliability.

Abstract: The proliferation of metaphor-based metaheuristics has often been accompanied by issues of symbolic inflation, benchmarking opacity, and statistical misuse. This study presents a diagnostic critique of the recently proposed Exponential Trigonometric Optimizer (ETO), exposing fundamental flaws in its algorithmic structure and the statistical reporting of its performance. Through a stripped mathematical reconstruction, we identify inert symbolic constructs, ill-defined recurrence schedules, and ineffective update mechanisms that collectively undermine the algorithm's purported balance and effectiveness. A principled benchmarking comparison against nine established metaheuristics on the CEC 2017 and 2021 suites reveals that ETO's performance claims are inflated. While it demonstrates mid-tier competitiveness, it consistently fails against top-tier algorithms, especially under high-dimensional and shift-rotated landscapes. Our statistical framework, employing rank-based non-parametric tests and effect size diagnostics, quantifies these limitations and highlights ETO's structural fragility and lack of scalability. The paper concludes by advocating for a reformist framework in metaheuristic research, emphasizing symbolic hygiene, operator attribution, and statistical transparency to mitigate misleading narratives and foster a more robust and reproducible optimization literature.

Result: DWAM enhances SNN performance under degraded conditions and improves those already equipped with homeostatic mechanisms.

Conclusion: DWAM offers a biologically inspired approach to improve SNN efficiency and adaptability through dynamic weight regulation, validated through practical tasks and conditions.

Abstract: Homeostatic mechanisms play a crucial role in maintaining optimal functionality within the neural circuits of the brain. By regulating physiological and biochemical processes, these mechanisms ensure the stability of an organism's internal environment, enabling it to better adapt to external changes. Among these mechanisms, the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) theory has been extensively studied as a key principle for maintaining the balance of synaptic strengths in biological systems. Despite the extensive development of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as a model for bionic neural networks, no prior work in the machine learning community has integrated biologically plausible BCM formulations into SNNs to provide homeostasis. In this study, we propose a Dynamic Weight Adaptation Mechanism (DWAM) for SNNs, inspired by the BCM theory. DWAM can be integrated into the host SNN, dynamically adjusting network weights in real time to regulate neuronal activity, providing homeostasis to the host SNN without any fine-tuning. We validated our method through dynamic obstacle avoidance and continuous control tasks under both normal and specifically designed degraded conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DWAM not only enhances the performance of SNNs without existing homeostatic mechanisms under various degraded conditions but also further improves the performance of SNNs that already incorporate homeostatic mechanisms.

*Han Zhang,Qingyan Meng,Jiaqi Wang,Baiyu Chen,Zhengyu Ma,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Temporal-adaptive Weight Quantization (TaWQ) for spiking neural networks, which adaptively assigns ultra-low-bit weights along the temporal dimension to reduce energy consumption without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy-efficient spiking neural networks require weight quantization, but achieving this without accuracy degradation is a challenge.

Method: The authors propose TaWQ, inspired by biological astrocyte-mediated synaptic modulation, to incorporate quantization with temporal dynamics, optimizing weight allocation over time.

Result: Experiments showed high energy efficiency (4.12M, 0.63mJ) with negligible accuracy loss (0.22% on ImageNet) using TaWQ, validated on both static and neuromorphic datasets.

Conclusion: TaWQ effectively balances energy efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating potential in energy-constrained SNN applications.

Abstract: Weight quantization in spiking neural networks (SNNs) could further reduce energy consumption. However, quantizing weights without sacrificing accuracy remains challenging. In this study, inspired by astrocyte-mediated synaptic modulation in the biological nervous systems, we propose Temporal-adaptive Weight Quantization (TaWQ), which incorporates weight quantization with temporal dynamics to adaptively allocate ultra-low-bit weights along the temporal dimension. Extensive experiments on static (e.g., ImageNet) and neuromorphic (e.g., CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate that our TaWQ maintains high energy efficiency (4.12M, 0.63mJ) while incurring a negligible quantization loss of only 0.22% on ImageNet.

*Yves Matanga,Yanxia Sun,Zenghui Wang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This study introduces enhancements to clustering-based multi-swarm particle optimization algorithms, improving their ability to detect multiple peaks by using local searches and advanced clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing clustering-based multi-swarm algorithms that rely on Euclidean distance and fail to detect multiple peaks effectively due to poor resolution.

Method: The paper introduces two enhancements: (1) a preliminary local search across initial particles to scout local regions effectively, and (2) an investigative clustering approach with concavity analysis to identify multiple sub-niches within clusters.

Result: The improved multi-swarm PSO algorithm, TImPSO, demonstrated a better peak detection ratio across various test functions compared to other algorithms using the IEEE CEC2013 niching datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements significantly improve the performance of multi-swarm optimization in identifying multiple optima, showing promise for more robust problem-solving in this algorithm family.

Abstract: Multi-swarm particle optimisation algorithms are gaining popularity due to their ability to locate multiple optimum points concurrently. In this family of algorithms, clustering-based multi-swarm algorithms are among the most effective techniques that join the closest particles together to form independent niche swarms that exploit potential promising regions. However, most clustering-based multi-swarms are Euclidean distance-based and only inquire about the potential of one peak within a cluster and thus can lose multiple peaks due to poor resolution. In a bid to improve the peak detection ratio, the current study proposes two enhancements. First, a preliminary local search across initial particles is proposed to ensure that each local region is sufficiently scouted prior to particle collaboration. Secondly, an investigative clustering approach that performs concavity analysis is proposed to evaluate the potential for several sub-niches within a single cluster. An improved clustering-based multi-swarm PSO (TImPSO) has resulted from these enhancements and has been tested against three competing algorithms in the same family using the IEEE CEC2013 niching datasets, resulting in an improved peak ratio for almost all the test functions.

TL;DR: GigaEvo is an open-source framework inspired by AlphaEvolve, allowing researchers to implement and experiment with LLM-guided evolutionary computation for complex optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of detailed implementation resources in prior LLM-evolution research (e.g., AlphaEvolve), enabling reproducibility and fostering further exploration in the field.

Method: Developed GigaEvo, an extensible and modular framework incorporating MAP-Elites algorithms, DAG-based pipelines, LLM-driven mutation, and multi-island strategies, tested on optimization benchmarks such as triangle placement, circle packing, and kissing numbers.

Result: The framework successfully replicated key AlphaEvolve experiments and demonstrated a robust design for modular experimentation in hybrid LLM-evolution approaches.

Conclusion: GigaEvo promotes reproducibility and accelerates research in LLM-integrated evolutionary computation by providing an open-source, well-documented tool for experimentation.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-guided evolutionary computation, particularly AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025; Georgiev et al., 2025), have demonstrated remarkable success in discovering novel mathematical constructions and solving challenging optimization problems. However, the high-level descriptions in published work leave many implementation details unspecified, hindering reproducibility and further research. In this report we present GigaEvo, an extensible open-source framework that enables researchers to study and experiment with hybrid LLM-evolution approaches inspired by AlphaEvolve. Our system provides modular implementations of key components: MAP-Elites quality-diversity algorithms, asynchronous DAG-based evaluation pipelines, LLM-driven mutation operators with insight generation and bidirectional lineage tracking, and flexible multi-island evolutionary strategies. In order to assess reproducibility and validate our implementation we evaluate GigaEvo on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: Heilbronn triangle placement, circle packing in squares, and high-dimensional kissing numbers. The framework emphasizes modularity, concurrency, and ease of experimentation, enabling rapid prototyping through declarative configuration. We provide detailed descriptions of system architecture, implementation decisions, and experimental methodology to support further research in LLM driven evolutionary methods. The GigaEvo framework and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/gigaevo-core.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARRDE, a new optimization algorithm, which demonstrates robust generalization across diverse benchmark suites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address robustness in numerical optimization algorithms that excel in specific benchmarks but struggle in different scenarios.

Method: Proposed ARRDE, based on LSHADE algorithm, incorporating mechanisms from jSO, nonlinear population-size reduction, and adaptive restart-refine strategies.

Result: Extensive evaluation showed ARRDE ranking first across five benchmark suites, outperforming strong competitors.

Conclusion: ARRDE is robust and has superior generalization capability compared to existing optimization algorithms.

Abstract: This study is motivated by a robustness issue in numerical optimization of bound-constrained problems: many algorithms that perform well on a particular benchmark suite, such as the IEEE CEC2017 problems, struggle to maintain the same level of performance when applied to other suites that differ in dimensionality, landscape complexity, or the maximum number of function evaluations ($N_{\text{max}}$). To address this, we propose the Adaptive Restart-Refine Differential Evolution (ARRDE) algorithm, a new variant of Differential Evolution (DE). ARRDE builds upon the LSHADE algorithm, incorporates key mechanisms from jSO, and introduces a nonlinear population-size reduction strategy combined with an adaptive restart-refine mechanism.
  We evaluate ARRDE on five benchmark suites (CEC2011, CEC2017, CEC2019, CEC2020, and CEC2022) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most extensive experimental study to date in the context of algorithmic comparison, as most prior works consider only one or two suites. This broad evaluation enables a rigorous assessment of generalization across markedly different problem characteristics. To further support fair cross-suite comparisons, we also introduce a bounded accuracy-based scoring metric derived from relative error. Using both rank-based and accuracy-based metrics, and comparing against algorithms that perform strongly on CEC2017 (e.g., jSO and LSHADE-cnEpSin) as well as those that excel on CEC2020 (e.g., j2020 and NLSHADE-RSP), ARRDE consistently demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking first across all benchmark suites considered. These results highlight ARRDE's robustness and its superior generalization capability.

TL;DR: The paper explores inversion vectors as a representation for permutation problems in evolutionary algorithms, offering theoretical analysis and experimental evidence on their efficiency compared to classical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The representation of candidate solutions significantly impacts the efficiency of metaheuristics and evolutionary algorithms, particularly in permutation spaces found in applications like scheduling and transportation.

Method: The study uses mathematical runtime analyses to compare inversion vector encodings with classical permutation representations, linking local changes and classical measures. Experimental studies are conducted on linear ordering and quadratic assignment problems.

Result: The inversion vector encoding method demonstrates theoretical advantages in efficiency and links to measures like inversion count, with experimental validation showing practical benefits.

Conclusion: Inversion vector encodings are a more efficient alternative for representing permutation spaces in evolutionary algorithms, validated through both mathematical analysis and practical experiments.

Abstract: A suitable choice of the representation of candidate solutions is crucial for the efficiency of evolutionary algorithms and related metaheuristics. We focus on problems in permutation spaces, which are at the core of numerous practical applications of such algorithms, e.g. in scheduling and transportation. Inversion vectors (also called Lehmer codes) are an alternative representation of the permutation space $S_n$ compared to the classical encoding as a vector of $n$ unique entries. In particular, they do not require any constraint handling. Using rigorous mathematical runtime analyses, we compare the efficiency of inversion vector encodings to the classical representation and give theory-guided advice on their choice. Moreover, we link the effect of local changes in the inversion code space to classical measures on permutations like the number of inversions. Finally, through experimental studies on linear ordering and quadratic assignment problems, we demonstrate the practical efficiency of inversion vector encodings.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper introduces Groot, a general-purpose configuration tuner that addresses diverse domains and performance-cost tradeoffs for software systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized software parameter tuners are limited to specific domains, optimization goals, or technologies, complicating usage for specialized and innovative ventures.

Method: The paper designs Groot as an agnostic, multi-goal, and adaptable configuration tuner, requiring minimal assumptions about parameters.

Result: Groot effectively improves performance and reduces resource usage across various real-world and benchmark scenarios.

Conclusion: Groot enhances configuration tuning for diverse setups, addressing the unique needs of specialized ventures without reliance on domain-specific expertise or predefined assumptions.

Abstract: Modern software systems are executed on a runtime stack with layers (virtualization, storage, trusted execution, etc.) each incurring an execution and/or monetary cost, which may be mitigated by finding suitable parameter configurations. While specialized parameter tuners exist, they are tied to a particular domain or use case, fixed in type and number of optimization goals, or focused on a specific layer or technology. These limitations pose significant adoption hurdles for specialized and innovative ventures (SIVs) that address a variety of domains and use cases, operate under strict cost-performance constraints requiring tradeoffs, and rely on self-hosted servers with custom technology stacks while having little data or expertise to set up and operate specialized tuners. In this paper, we present Groot - a general-purpose configuration tuner designed to a) be explicitly agnostic of a particular domain or use case, b) balance multiple potentially competing optimization goals, c) support different custom technology setups, and d) make minimal assumptions about parameter types, ranges, or suitable values. Our evaluation on both real-world use cases and benchmarks shows that Groot reliably improves performance and reduces resource consumption in scenarios representative for SIVs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost and memory inefficiency challenges in large matrix multiplication, which are central to machine learning workloads.

Method: Leverages low-rank approximations, FP8 precision, and intelligent kernel selection to optimize matrix multiplications. Adapts decomposition methods and precision using the matrix and hardware specifics.

Result: Achieved up to 378 TFLOPS with 75% memory savings and 7.8x speedup on large matrices using an NVIDIA RTX 4090.

Conclusion: Low-Rank GEMM demonstrates a superior approach to traditional matrix multiplication methods for large matrices, enhancing speed, efficiency, and memory usage.

Abstract: Large matrix multiplication is a cornerstone of modern machine learning workloads, yet traditional approaches suffer from cubic computational complexity (e.g., $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ for a matrix of size $n\times n$). We present Low-Rank GEMM, a novel approach that leverages low-rank matrix approximations to achieve sub-quadratic complexity while maintaining hardware-accelerated performance through FP8 precision and intelligent kernel selection. On a NVIDIA RTX 4090, our implementation achieves up to 378 TFLOPS on matrices up to $N=20480$, providing 75\% memory savings and $7.8\times$ speedup over PyTorch FP32 for large matrices. The system automatically adapts to hardware capabilities, selecting optimal decomposition methods (SVD, randomized SVD) and precision levels based on matrix characteristics and available accelerators. Comprehensive benchmarking on NVIDIA RTX 4090 demonstrates that Low-Rank GEMM becomes the fastest approach for matrices $N\geq10240$, surpassing traditional cuBLAS implementations through memory bandwidth optimization rather than computational shortcuts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TensorRight, an automatic system to verify tensor graph rewrites for tensors of arbitrary ranks and sizes. It outperforms existing methods in tackling unbounded verification with innovative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tensor compilers lack a system to verify tensor graph rewrites for arbitrary ranks and sizes, creating a need for fully automated soundness verification.

Method: TensorRight uses the TensorRight DSL, a language with aggregated-axes for reasoning about unbounded axes, and an algorithm to compute rank bounds for unbounded verification by breaking it into bounded-verification tasks solvable via SMT solvers.

Result: TensorRight successfully verified the correctness of 115 out of 175 XLA rewrite rules, surpassing other systems' capabilities.

Conclusion: The work successfully fills the gap in verifying tensor rewrites for arbitrary tensor ranks and sizes, achieving a breakthrough for both practical and theoretical advancements in tensor compilation.

Abstract: Tensor compilers, essential for generating efficient code for deep learning models across various applications, employ tensor graph rewrites as one of the key optimizations. These rewrites optimize tensor computational graphs with the expectation of preserving semantics for tensors of arbitrary rank and size. Despite this expectation, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a fully automated verification system to prove the soundness of these rewrites for tensors of arbitrary rank and size. Previous works, while successful in verifying rewrites with tensors of concrete rank, do not provide guarantees in the unbounded setting.
  To fill this gap, we introduce TensorRight, the first automatic verification system that can verify tensor graph rewrites for input tensors of arbitrary rank and size. We introduce a core language, TensorRight DSL, to represent rewrite rules using a novel axis definition, called aggregated-axis, which allows us to reason about an unbounded number of axes. We achieve unbounded verification by proving that there exists a bound on tensor ranks, under which bounded verification of all instances implies the correctness of the rewrite rule in the unbounded setting. We derive an algorithm to compute this rank using the denotational semantics of TensorRight DSL. TensorRight employs this algorithm to generate a finite number of bounded-verification proof obligations, which are then dispatched to an SMT solver using symbolic execution to automatically verify the correctness of the rewrite rules. We evaluate TensorRight's verification capabilities by implementing rewrite rules present in XLA's algebraic simplifier. The results demonstrate that TensorRight can prove the correctness of 115 out of 175 rules in their full generality, while the closest automatic, bounded-verification system can express only 18 of these rules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between research and industry development platforms, particularly between AUTOSAR AP (used in development) and ROS 2 (used in research), which slows down commercialization in autonomous vehicle research.

Method: The authors propose a collaboration framework using Data Distribution Service (DDS) for communication between AUTOSAR AP and ROS 2. The framework includes a bridge converter that addresses protocol differences, automatically generates configuration files, and integrates ROS 2 tools effectively.

Result: The framework's functionality and performance were empirically validated, demonstrating efficient conversion time and seamless integration with ROS 2 tools.

Conclusion: The proposed solution successfully bridges the gap between AUTOSAR AP and ROS 2, increasing their collaboration capabilities and potentially accelerating the commercialization process of autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: The field of autonomous vehicle research is advancing rapidly, necessitating platforms that meet real-time performance, safety, and security requirements for practical deployment. AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform (AUTOSAR AP) is widely adopted in development to meet these criteria; however, licensing constraints and tool implementation challenges limit its use in research. Conversely, Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is predominantly used in research within the autonomous driving domain, leading to a disparity between research and development platforms that hinders swift commercialization. This paper proposes a collaboration framework that enables AUTOSAR AP and ROS 2 to communicate with each other using a Data Distribution Service for Real-Time Systems (DDS). In contrast, AUTOSAR AP uses Scalable service-Oriented Middleware over IP (SOME/IP) for communication. The proposed framework bridges these protocol differences, ensuring seamless interaction between the two platforms. We validate the functionality and performance of our bridge converter through empirical analysis, demonstrating its efficiency in conversion time and ease of integration with ROS 2 tools. Furthermore, the availability of the proposed collaboration framework is improved by automatically generating a configuration file for the proposed bridge converter.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an implicit neural field framework for process planning in multi-axis manufacturing, integrating layer generation and toolpath design into one differentiable pipeline with direct collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat layer generation and toolpath design separately, leading to indirect collision handling and lack of control during optimization. A unified approach is needed.

Method: The authors use sinusoidally activated neural networks to represent manufacturing components as implicit fields, enabling direct processing, collision avoidance, and joint optimization.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrates its generality and effectiveness in both additive and subtractive manufacturing.

Conclusion: This unified approach via implicit neural fields offers precise collision handling, optimization, and stability control in multi-axis manufacturing.

Abstract: Existing curved-layer-based process planning methods for multi-axis manufacturing address collisions only indirectly and generate toolpaths in a post-processing step, leaving toolpath geometry uncontrolled during optimization. We present an implicit neural field-based framework for multi-axis process planning that overcomes these limitations by embedding both layer generation and toolpath design within a single differentiable pipeline. Using sinusoidally activated neural networks to represent layers and toolpaths as implicit fields, our method enables direct evaluation of field values and derivatives at any spatial point, thereby allowing explicit collision avoidance and joint optimization of manufacturing layers and toolpaths. We further investigate how network hyperparameters and objective definitions influence singularity behavior and topology transitions, offering built-in mechanisms for regularization and stability control. The proposed approach is demonstrated on examples in both additive and subtractive manufacturing, validating its generality and effectiveness.

Motivation: To address the gap in cultural semantic fidelity in robotic arm choreography and explore symbolic posture transfer with portable applications.

Method: The authors developed ROPERA, a three-stage pipeline for encoding culturally significant postures, creating symbolic sequences, and decoding gestures into servo commands, tested with Kunqu opera materials.

Result: The pipeline achieved reproducible execution with timing and cultural legibility, confirmed by expert and audience feedback.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of preserving cultural semantics using robots, advocates portable workflows, and outlines a future focus on enhancing transitions and broader applications.

Abstract: Robotic arm choreography often reproduces trajectories while missing cultural semantics. This study examines whether symbolic posture transfer with joint space compatible notation can preserve semantic fidelity on a six-degree-of-freedom arm and remain portable across morphologies. We implement ROPERA, a three-stage pipeline for encoding culturally codified postures, composing symbolic sequences, and decoding to servo commands. A scene from Kunqu opera, \textit{The Peony Pavilion}, serves as the material for evaluation. The procedure includes corpus-based posture selection, symbolic scoring, direct joint angle execution, and a visual layer with light painting and costume-informed colors. Results indicate reproducible execution with intended timing and cultural legibility reported by experts and audiences. The study points to non-anthropocentric cultural preservation and portable authoring workflows. Future work will design dance-informed transition profiles, extend the notation to locomotion with haptic, musical, and spatial cues, and test portability across platforms.

Result: Achieved sub-10% velocity estimation error in complex lunar terrains and around 1% in typical terrains, fitting CPU budgets for small lunar landers.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables real-time, lightweight, and precise navigation solutions for small lunar missions.

Abstract: Private lunar missions are faced with the challenge of robust autonomous navigation while operating under stringent constraints on mass, power, and computational resources. This work proposes a motion-field inversion framework that uses optical flow and rangefinder-based depth estimation as a lightweight CPU-based solution for egomotion estimation during lunar descent. We extend classical optical flow formulations by integrating them with depth modeling strategies tailored to the geometry for lunar/planetary approach, descent, and landing, specifically, planar and spherical terrain approximations parameterized by a laser rangefinder. Motion field inversion is performed through a least-squares framework, using sparse optical flow features extracted via the pyramidal Lucas-Kanade algorithm. We verify our approach using synthetically generated lunar images over the challenging terrain of the lunar south pole, using CPU budgets compatible with small lunar landers. The results demonstrate accurate velocity estimation from approach to landing, with sub-10% error for complex terrain and on the order of 1% for more typical terrain, as well as performances suitable for real-time applications. This framework shows promise for enabling robust, lightweight on-board navigation for small lunar missions.

Abstract: Robotic laser systems offer the potential for sub-millimeter, non-contact, high-precision tissue resection, yet existing platforms lack volumetric planning and intraoperative feedback. We present RATS (Robot-Assisted Tissue Surgery), an intelligent opto-mechanical, optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided robotic platform designed for autonomous volumetric soft tissue resection in surgical applications. RATS integrates macro-scale RGB-D imaging, micro-scale OCT, and a fiber-coupled surgical laser, calibrated through a novel multistage alignment pipeline that achieves OCT-to-laser calibration accuracy of 0.161+-0.031mm on tissue phantoms and ex vivo porcine tissue. A super-Gaussian laser-tissue interaction (LTI) model characterizes ablation crater morphology with an average RMSE of 0.231+-0.121mm, outperforming Gaussian baselines. A sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) framework operates directly on OCT voxel data to generate constraint-aware resection trajectories with closed-loop feedback, achieving 0.842mm RMSE and improving intersection-over-union agreement by 64.8% compared to feedforward execution. With OCT, RATS detects subsurface structures and modifies the planner's objective to preserve them, demonstrating clinical feasibility.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a regulator-driven methodology for evaluating and enhancing the safety of learning-based, autonomous mobile robots by adhering to evolving safety rules defined using Signal Temporal Logic (STL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure reliable and human-centric compliance with safety rules for autonomous systems by translating requirements into measurable robustness metrics.

Method: The paper uses STL specifications to evaluate rollout traces of black-box autonomous models and introduces quantitative metrics (TRV, LRV) to iteratively guide retraining and improvement. Experiments were conducted in both simulated and real-world environments.

Result: Significant improvements were observed in safety compliance across two applications: virtual driving and autonomous navigation, with increases in adherence metrics ranging from 16% to 1138%. Validation on a real-world TurtleBot3 demonstrated better obstacle navigation.

Conclusion: The iterative and regulator-driven framework proves effective in enhancing the safety metrics of autonomous systems, contributing to improved real-world compliance and safe navigation.

Abstract: We present a novel, regulator-driven approach for post hoc safety evaluation of learning-based, black-box autonomous mobile robots, ensuring ongoing compliance with evolving, human-defined safety rules. In our iterative workflow, human safety requirements are translated by regulators into Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. Rollout traces from the black-box model are externally verified for compliance, yielding quantitative safety metrics, Total Robustness Value (TRV) and Largest Robustness Value (LRV), which measure average and worst-case specification adherence. These metrics inform targeted retraining and iterative improvement by model designers. We apply our method across two different applications: a virtual driving scenario and an autonomous mobile robot navigating a complex environment, and observe statistically significant improvements across both scenarios. In the virtual driving scenario, we see a 177% increase in traces adhering to the simulation speed limit, a 1138% increase in traces minimizing off-road driving, and a 16% increase in traces successfully reaching the goal within the time limit. In the autonomous navigation scenario, there is a 300% increase in traces avoiding sharp turns, a 200% increase in traces reaching the goal within the time limit, and a 49% increase in traces minimizing time spent near obstacles. Finally, we validate our approach on a TurtleBot3 robot in the real world, and demonstrate improved obstacle navigation with safety buffers.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework SM$^2$ITH for mobile manipulators to safely interact with humans using interactive human motion prediction and hierarchical control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimization methods for mobile manipulators work mainly in static environments, but adapting to dynamic human-centered environments requires predictive human-robot interaction models.

Method: A framework called SM$^2$ITH introduces Task-Hierarchical Bilevel Model Predictive Control combining HTMPC with interactive human predictive motion models.

Result: SM$^2$ITH was validated on two mobile manipulators (Stretch 3 and Ridgeback-UR10) across delivery tasks, pick-and-place tasks using human prediction models, and interactions with adversarial human behavior. It outperformed traditional baseline methods.

Conclusion: Interactive human motion prediction enhances safety and efficiency in dynamic human-centered environments for mobile manipulators.

Abstract: Mobile manipulators are designed to perform complex sequences of navigation and manipulation tasks in human-centered environments. While recent optimization-based methods such as Hierarchical Task Model Predictive Control (HTMPC) enable efficient multitask execution with strict task priorities, they have so far been applied mainly to static or structured scenarios. Extending these approaches to dynamic human-centered environments requires predictive models that capture how humans react to the actions of the robot. This work introduces Safe Mobile Manipulation with Interactive Human Prediction via Task-Hierarchical Bilevel Model Predictive Control (SM$^2$ITH), a unified framework that combines HTMPC with interactive human motion prediction through bilevel optimization that jointly accounts for robot and human dynamics. The framework is validated on two different mobile manipulators, the Stretch 3 and the Ridgeback-UR10, across three experimental settings: (i) delivery tasks with different navigation and manipulation priorities, (ii) sequential pick-and-place tasks with different human motion prediction models, and (iii) interactions involving adversarial human behavior. Our results highlight how interactive prediction enables safe and efficient coordination, outperforming baselines that rely on weighted objectives or open-loop human models.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MobileVLA-R1, a unified framework for grounding natural-language instructions to quadruped robot control, overcoming limitations in semantic reasoning and actuation. It delivers robust performance via a large-scale reasoning dataset and two-stage training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to seamlessly integrate high-level semantic reasoning with low-level continuous control, leading to instabilities and poor real-world adaptability for quadruped robots.

Method: The framework employs a newly-developed dataset MobileVLA-CoT for reasoning supervision and adopts a two-stage training method combining supervised Chain-of-Thought alignment with GRPO reinforcement learning techniques.

Result: The system achieves an approximate 5% improvement in performance across various VLN and VLA tasks compared to baselines. It successfully demonstrates robust real-world operation on quadruped robots in complex environments.

Conclusion: MobileVLA-R1 serves as a robust solution for executing natural language instructions via continuous control on quadruped robots, advancing precision and adaptability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Grounding natural-language instructions into continuous control for quadruped robots remains a fundamental challenge in vision language action. Existing methods struggle to bridge high-level semantic reasoning and low-level actuation, leading to unstable grounding and weak generalization in the real world. To address these issues, we present MobileVLA-R1, a unified vision-language-action framework that enables explicit reasoning and continuous control for quadruped robots. We construct MobileVLA-CoT, a large-scale dataset of multi-granularity chain-of-thought (CoT) for embodied trajectories, providing structured reasoning supervision for alignment. Built upon this foundation, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm that combines supervised CoT alignment with GRPO reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning consistency, control stability, and long-horizon execution. Extensive evaluations on VLN and VLA tasks demonstrate superior performance over strong baselines, with approximately a 5% improvement. Real-world deployment on a quadruped robot validates robust performance in complex environments. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MobileVLA-R1.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces L1 Flow, a hybrid approach combining advantages of denoising models and L1 regression for robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to merge the benefits of denoising models (multi-modal distribution capturing) with L1 regression (efficiency and fast convergence) for robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: The authors reformulated v-prediction flow matching into a sample-prediction approach using the L1 training objective, enabling multi-modality via a single ODE step. They propose a two-step sampling schedule for efficient and precise action sequence generation.

Result: Evaluations on MimicGen, RoboMimic, PushT Bench, and real-world tasks demonstrate improved training efficiency, faster inference, and better overall performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: L1 Flow retains the strengths of flow matching while addressing inefficiencies, showing significant advantages in robotic manipulation tasks across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Denoising-based models, such as diffusion and flow matching, have been a critical component of robotic manipulation for their strong distribution-fitting and scaling capacity. Concurrently, several works have demonstrated that simple learning objectives, such as L1 regression, can achieve performance comparable to denoising-based methods on certain tasks, while offering faster convergence and inference. In this paper, we focus on how to combine the advantages of these two paradigms: retaining the ability of denoising models to capture multi-modal distributions and avoid mode collapse while achieving the efficiency of the L1 regression objective. To achieve this vision, we reformulate the original v-prediction flow matching and transform it into sample-prediction with the L1 training objective. We empirically show that the multi-modality can be expressed via a single ODE step. Thus, we propose \textbf{L1 Flow}, a two-step sampling schedule that generates a suboptimal action sequence via a single integration step and then reconstructs the precise action sequence through a single prediction. The proposed method largely retains the advantages of flow matching while reducing the iterative neural function evaluations to merely two and mitigating the potential performance degradation associated with direct sample regression. We evaluate our method with varying baselines and benchmarks, including 8 tasks in MimicGen, 5 tasks in RoboMimic \& PushT Bench, and one task in the real-world scenario. The results show the advantages of the proposed method with regard to training efficiency, inference speed, and overall performance. \href{https://song-wx.github.io/l1flow.github.io/}{Project Website.}

TL;DR: Switch-JustDance introduces a reproducible and low-cost benchmarking pipeline using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch to evaluate robot whole-body control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized and reproducible benchmarks for real-world robot control that allows comparison to humans.

Method: Uses console game Just Dance to generate robot-executable motions, assesses controller performance via the scoring system, and evaluates reliability and bias.

Result: Showed consistent performance evaluation for embodied AI and benchmarked state-of-the-art humanoid controllers.

Conclusion: Switch-JustDance is validated as an effective benchmarking tool, offering insights into humanoid controller strengths and limitations while supporting reproducible evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in whole-body robot control have enabled humanoid and legged robots to perform increasingly agile and coordinated motions. However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating these capabilities in real-world settings, and in direct comparison to humans, remain scarce. Existing evaluations often rely on pre-collected human motion datasets or simulation-based experiments, which limit reproducibility, overlook hardware factors, and hinder fair human-robot comparisons. We present Switch-JustDance, a low-cost and reproducible benchmarking pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games, Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch, to evaluate robot whole-body control. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative platform, Switch-JustDance converts in-game choreography into robot-executable motions through streaming, motion reconstruction, and motion retargeting modules and enables users to evaluate controller performance through the game's built-in scoring system. We first validate the evaluation properties of Just Dance, analyzing its reliability, validity, sensitivity, and potential sources of bias. Our results show that the platform provides consistent and interpretable performance measures, making it a suitable tool for benchmarking embodied AI. Building on this foundation, we benchmark three state-of-the-art humanoid whole-body controllers on hardware and provide insights into their relative strengths and limitations.

TL;DR: RoboArmGS introduces a novel method to refine robotic arm motion modeling using learnable Bézier curves for improved real-world accuracy and rendering quality, supported by a new dataset RoboArm4D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for creating digital assets of robotic arms struggle with modeling real-world noisy motion accurately and producing high-quality renderings due to passive reliance on static URDF-rigged motions.

Method: RoboArmGS introduces a hybrid representation using a learnable Bézier curve motion refiner to correct per-joint residuals, improving the modeling of real-world robotic arm motion.

Result: RoboArmGS outperforms existing methods in modeling real-world motion and rendering quality based on evaluations using the newly introduced RoboArm4D dataset.

Conclusion: RoboArmGS enhances the Real2Sim2Real pipeline by addressing motion mismatches and improving digital asset quality for robotic arms, with a publicly available dataset and code to drive further research.

Abstract: Building high-quality digital assets of robotic arms is crucial yet challenging for the Real2Sim2Real pipeline. Current approaches naively bind static 3D Gaussians according to URDF links, forcing them to follow an URDF-rigged motion passively. However, real-world arm motion is noisy, and the idealized URDF-rigged motion cannot accurately model it, leading to severe rendering artifacts in 3D Gaussians. To address these challenges, we propose RoboArmGS, a novel hybrid representation that refines the URDF-rigged motion with learnable Bézier curves, enabling more accurate real-world motion modeling. To be more specific, we present a learnable Bézier Curve motion refiner that corrects per-joint residuals to address mismatches between real-world motion and URDF-rigged motion. RoboArmGS enables the learning of more accurate real-world motion while achieving a coherent binding of 3D Gaussians across arm parts. To support future research, we contribute a carefully collected dataset named RoboArm4D, which comprises several widely used robotic arms for evaluating the quality of building high-quality digital assets. We evaluate our approach on RoboArm4D, and RoboArmGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world motion modeling and rendering quality. The code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inconsistency issue in VINS, which stems from a lack of comprehensive understanding of the dynamic emergence of inconsistency across different estimation steps.

Method: The paper proposes the novel USE framework to track the unobservable subspace's evolution and introduces the USA solution paradigm with two methods: transformation-based and re-evaluation-based interventions.

Result: Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively eliminate inconsistency in VINS while maintaining estimator accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Selective intervention at specific estimation steps to address observability misalignment resolves inconsistency effectively, offering both practical and computationally efficient solutions for VINS.

Abstract: The inconsistency issue in the Visual-Inertial Navigation System (VINS) is a long-standing and fundamental challenge. While existing studies primarily attribute the inconsistency to observability mismatch, these analyses are often based on simplified theoretical formulations that consider only prediction and SLAM correction. Such formulations fail to cover the non-standard estimation steps, such as MSCKF correction and delayed initialization, which are critical for practical VINS estimators. Furthermore, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of how inconsistency dynamically emerges across estimation steps has hindered the development of precise and efficient solutions. As a result, current approaches often face a trade-off between estimator accuracy, consistency, and implementation complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel analysis framework termed Unobservable Subspace Evolution (USE), which systematically characterizes how the unobservable subspace evolves throughout the entire estimation pipeline by explicitly tracking changes in its evaluation points. This perspective sheds new light on how individual estimation steps contribute to inconsistency. Our analysis reveals that observability misalignment induced by certain steps is the antecedent of observability mismatch. Guided by this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution paradigm, Unobservable Subspace Alignment (USA), which eliminates inconsistency by selectively intervening only in those estimation steps that induce misalignment. We design two USA methods: transformation-based and re-evaluation-based, both offering accurate and computationally lightweight solutions. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of continual learning capabilities in Vision-Language-Action models which are heavily reliant on task-specific fine-tuning despite massive pretraining data.

Method: Proposed Stellar VLA with two variants, T-Stellar and TS-Stellar, which focus on self-supervised knowledge evolution by modeling task-centric knowledge and hierarchical task-skill structures.

Result: Experiments show Stellar VLA achieves over 50% improvement in success rates compared to baselines, with TS-Stellar excelling in complex action inference and effective knowledge retention and discovery.

Conclusion: Stellar VLA offers a resource-efficient framework for continual learning in robots, enabling better task specialization and performance without requiring extensive manual fine-tuning.

Abstract: Developing general robot intelligence in open environments requires continual skill learning. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage massive pretraining data to support diverse manipulation tasks, but they still depend heavily on task-specific fine-tuning, revealing a lack of continual learning capability. Existing continual learning methods are also resource-intensive to scale to VLA models. We propose Stellar VLA, a knowledge-driven continual learning framework with two variants: T-Stellar, modeling task-centric knowledge space, and TS-Stellar, capturing hierarchical task-skill structure. Stellar VLA enables self-supervised knowledge evolution through joint learning of task latent representation and the knowledge space, reducing annotation needs. Knowledge-guided expert routing provide task specialization without extra network parameters, lowering training overhead.Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world tasks show over 50 percentage average improvement in final success rates relative to baselines. TS-Stellar further excels in complex action inference, and in-depth analyses verify effective knowledge retention and discovery. Our code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV swarms rely on wireless communication for mission coordination, making them vulnerable to jamming, which disrupts system efficiency and success.

Method: The framework integrates GA for trajectory stabilization, SL for replication under known structures, and RL using Proximal Policy Optimization for adaptability. Null-steering antennas are incorporated for interference resistance, enhancing system resilience.

Result: GA provided stable but computationally expensive solutions, while SL faced challenges in dynamic environments. RL exhibited adaptability, real-time decision-making, and efficient operation. The Adaptive Movement Model generalized UAV motion directions effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully mitigates jamming in UAV swarms while maintaining stable communication and mission efficiency, offering a reproducible model for future advancements in swarm communication systems.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms represent a key advancement in autonomous systems, enabling coordinated missions through inter-UAV communication. However, their reliance on wireless links makes them vulnerable to jamming, which can disrupt coordination and mission success. This work investigates whether a UAV swarm can effectively overcome jamming while maintaining communication and mission efficiency.
  To address this, a unified optimization framework combining Genetic Algorithms (GA), Supervised Learning (SL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) is proposed. The mission model, structured into epochs and timeslots, allows dynamic path planning, antenna orientation, and swarm formation while progressively enforcing collision rules. Null-steering antennas enhance resilience by directing antenna nulls toward interference sources.
  Results show that the GA achieved stable, collision-free trajectories but with high computational cost. SL models replicated GA-based configurations but struggled to generalize under dynamic or constrained settings. RL, trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), demonstrated adaptability and real-time decision-making with consistent communication and lower computational demand. Additionally, the Adaptive Movement Model generalized UAV motion to arbitrary directions through a rotation-based mechanism, validating the scalability of the proposed system.
  Overall, UAV swarms equipped with null-steering antennas and guided by intelligent optimization algorithms effectively mitigate jamming while maintaining communication stability, formation cohesion, and collision safety. The proposed framework establishes a unified, flexible, and reproducible basis for future research on resilient swarm communication systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for intrinsic perception in tendon-driven continuum robots using motor signals, demonstrated through various experiments with the Spirob robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tendon-driven continuum robots are intrinsically safe, but their reliance on external sensors limits scalability and increases hardware complexity, motivating the need for intrinsic perception based on robot dynamics.

Method: The paper develops a unified multi-dynamics modeling framework incorporating motor electrical dynamics, motor-winch dynamics, and continuum robot dynamics, enabling intrinsic perception through motor signal analysis.

Result: The proposed framework successfully detects passive contacts, enables active sensing, and estimates object size using intrinsic motor signals, validated experimentally and via simulation.

Conclusion: The framework offers a physically grounded approach to interpret motor signals for intrinsic perception, enhancing the capabilities of tendon-driven continuum robots.

Abstract: Tendon-driven continuum robots offer intrinsically safe and contact-rich interactions owing to their kinematic redundancy and structural compliance. However, their perception often depends on external sensors, which increase hardware complexity and limit scalability. This work introduces a unified multi-dynamics modeling framework for tendon-driven continuum robotic systems, exemplified by a spiral-inspired robot named Spirob. The framework integrates motor electrical dynamics, motor-winch dynamics, and continuum robot dynamics into a coherent system model. Within this framework, motor signals such as current and angular displacement are modeled to expose the electromechanical signatures of external interactions, enabling perception grounded in intrinsic dynamics. The model captures and validates key physical behaviors of the real system, including actuation hysteresis and self-contact at motion limits. Building on this foundation, the framework is applied to environmental interaction: first for passive contact detection, verified experimentally against simulation data; then for active contact sensing, where control and perception strategies from simulation are successfully applied to the real robot; and finally for object size estimation, where a policy learned in simulation is directly deployed on hardware. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides a physically grounded way to interpret interaction signatures from intrinsic motor signals in tendon-driven continuum robots.

TL;DR: EchoVLA is a new memory-aware Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model designed for long-horizon mobile manipulation, utilizing a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models are limited to short-horizon tasks and lack the necessary reasoning and memory capabilities for complex, long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks.

Method: EchoVLA introduces a synergistic declarative memory system combining scene memory (spatial-semantic maps) and episodic memory (multimodal task experiences). It uses updates and retrieval mechanisms based on observations, instructions, and task history to guide mobile-arm diffusion policies. A new benchmark, MoMani, supports large-scale model training and evaluation using MLLM planning and robot demonstrations.

Result: EchoVLA demonstrated enhanced performance in both simulated and real-world experiments, improving success rates (SR) in manipulation/navigation and mobile manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: EchoVLA is effective in overcoming the limitations of existing VLAs, showing promise for real-world applications in long-horizon mobile manipulation.

Abstract: Recent progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models has enabled embodied agents to interpret multimodal instructions and perform complex tasks. However, existing VLAs are mostly confined to short-horizon, table-top manipulation, lacking the memory and reasoning capability required for long-horizon mobile manipulation, where agents must coordinate navigation and manipulation under changing spatial contexts. In this work, we present EchoVLA, a memory-aware VLA model for long-horizon mobile manipulation. EchoVLA incorporates a synergistic declarative memory inspired by the human brain, consisting of a scene memory that maintains a collection of spatial-semantic maps and an episodic memory that stores task-level experiences with multimodal contextual features. During both training and inference, the two memories are individually stored, updated, and retrieved based on current observations, task history, and instructions, and their retrieved representations are fused via coarse- and fine-grained attention to guide mobile-arm diffusion policies. To support large-scale training and evaluation, we further introduce MoMani, an automated benchmark that generates expert-level long-horizon trajectories through multimodal large language model (MLLM)-guided planning and feedback-driven refinement, supplemented with real-robot demonstrations. Experiments in simulated and real-world settings show that EchoVLA improves long-horizon performance, reaching 0.52 SR on manipulation/navigation and 0.31 on mobile manipulation, exceeding $π_{0.5}$ by +0.08 and +0.11.

*Yilong Wang,Cheng Qian,Ruomeng Fan,Edward Johns*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ObAct, an active vision imitation learning framework for a dual-arm robotic system, significantly enhancing policy performance through dynamic observer-act roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imitation learning methods struggle with occlusions and suboptimal observations, reducing the clarity of object and gripper representations in robotic systems.

Method: The observer arm optimally positions itself using a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation constructed from images, while the actor arm uses these inputs to execute imitation learning policies.

Result: Compared to static-camera setups, the framework improves policy performance remarkably: trajectory transfer by 145%-233% and behavior cloning by 75%-143%.

Conclusion: Dynamic observer-actor roles lead to clearer observations, minimized occlusions, and robust training distribution alignment, significantly improving robotic imitation learning.

Abstract: We propose Observer Actor (ObAct), a novel framework for active vision imitation learning in which the observer moves to optimal visual observations for the actor. We study ObAct on a dual-arm robotic system equipped with wrist-mounted cameras. At test time, ObAct dynamically assigns observer and actor roles: the observer arm constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation from three images, virtually explores this to find an optimal camera pose, then moves to this pose; the actor arm then executes a policy using the observer's observations. This formulation enhances the clarity and visibility of both the object and the gripper in the policy's observations. As a result, we enable the training of ambidextrous policies on observations that remain closer to the occlusion-free training distribution, leading to more robust policies. We study this formulation with two existing imitation learning methods -- trajectory transfer and behavior cloning -- and experiments show that ObAct significantly outperforms static-camera setups: trajectory transfer improves by 145% without occlusion and 233% with occlusion, while behavior cloning improves by 75% and 143%, respectively.

Motivation: Address the need for precise and damage-free assembly in delicate snap-fit tasks, particularly in applications like eyewear or electronics assembly.

Method: Developed SnapNet, a lightweight neural network, and integrated it with a dual-arm coordination framework based on dynamical systems for detecting and modulating forces in real-time.

Result: Demonstrated high detection accuracy (96%+ recall) and a 30% reduction in peak impact forces during experiments with diverse geometries.

Conclusion: Proves that proprioceptive signals can enable reliable detection and coordination during delicate assembly tasks, improving precision and minimizing damage.

Abstract: Delicate snap-fit assemblies, such as inserting a lens into an eye-wear frame or during electronics assembly, demand timely engagement detection and rapid force attenuation to prevent overshoot-induced component damage or assembly failure. We address these challenges with two key contributions. First, we introduce SnapNet, a lightweight neural network that detects snap-fit engagement from joint-velocity transients in real-time, showing that reliable detection can be achieved using proprioceptive signals without external sensors. Second, we present a dynamical-systems-based dual-arm coordination framework that integrates SnapNet driven detection with an event-triggered impedance modulation, enabling accurate alignment and compliant insertion during delicate snap-fit assemblies. Experiments across diverse geometries on a heterogeneous bimanual platform demonstrate high detection accuracy (over 96% recall) and up to a 30% reduction in peak impact forces compared to standard impedance control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in safe navigation within dynamic environments caused by uncertain obstacle behaviors and lack of formal prediction guarantees.

Method: Proposed two CP-based frameworks: (1) a global planner integrating Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP) for long-term safety guarantees and (2) a local reactive planner with adaptive CP for handling uncertainties dynamically. They introduced an adaptive quantile mechanism to automatically adjust safety margins.

Result: Numerical experiments validate that the frameworks efficiently navigate dynamic and cluttered environments while maintaining safety and trajectory feasibility.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks improve robust and adaptive motion planning under uncertainty, offering a significant advancement in safe and feasible navigation strategies.

Abstract: Safe navigation in dynamic environments remains challenging due to uncertain obstacle behaviors and the lack of formal prediction guarantees. We propose two motion planning frameworks that leverage conformal prediction (CP): a global planner that integrates Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP) for uncertainty-aware trajectory generation, and a local planner that performs online reactive planning. The global planner offers distribution-free safety guarantees for long-horizon navigation, while the local planner mitigates inaccuracies in obstacle trajectory predictions through adaptive CP, enabling robust and responsive motion in dynamic environments. To further enhance trajectory feasibility, we introduce an adaptive quantile mechanism in the CP-based uncertainty quantification. Instead of using a fixed confidence level, the quantile is automatically tuned to the optimal value that preserves trajectory feasibility, allowing the planner to adaptively tighten safety margins in regions with higher uncertainty. We validate the proposed framework through numerical experiments conducted in dynamic and cluttered environments. The project page is available at https://time-aware-planning.github.io

### [723] [Off-Road Navigation via Implicit Neural Representation of Terrain Traversability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18183)
*Yixuan Jia,Qingyuan Li,Jonathan P. How*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRAIL, a framework to improve off-road robot navigation by considering terrain properties and optimizing path geometry and speed using an implicit neural representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods for off-road robots are constrained by short-term control and lack the ability to adjust speed based on terrain bumpiness, which compromises smooth navigation.

Method: TRAIL uses an implicit neural representation to parameterize terrain traversability and integrates it with gradient-based trajectory optimization for better path geometry and speed adjustment.

Result: The framework introduces spatial gradients that enhance the robot's ability to adapt speed and trajectory based on terrain properties.

Conclusion: TRAIL improves off-road navigation by enabling smooth traversal and better optimization of paths, overcoming the limitations of short-term planning methods.

Abstract: Autonomous off-road navigation requires robots to estimate terrain traversability from onboard sensors and plan accordingly. Conventional approaches typically rely on sampling-based planners such as MPPI to generate short-term control actions that aim to minimize traversal time and risk measures derived from the traversability estimates. These planners can react quickly but optimize only over a short look-ahead window, limiting their ability to reason about the full path geometry, which is important for navigating in challenging off-road environments. Moreover, they lack the ability to adjust speed based on the terrain bumpiness, which is important for smooth navigation on challenging terrains. In this paper, we introduce TRAIL (Traversability with an Implicit Learned Representation), an off-road navigation framework that leverages an implicit neural representation to continuously parameterize terrain properties. This representation yields spatial gradients that enable integration with a novel gradient-based trajectory optimization method that adapts the path geometry and speed profile based on terrain traversability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SkillWrapper, a method to create symbolic predicates from raw sensory inputs to aid robots in solving long-horizon tasks with black-box skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the challenge of generalizing low-level skill execution to solve long-horizon tasks, leveraging symbolic and object-centric abstractions compatible with planners.

Method: Proposes a formal theory for generative predicate invention and introduces SkillWrapper, which uses foundation models and RGB observations to learn symbolic, plannable representations.

Result: SkillWrapper demonstrates success in learning abstractions that allow robots to solve unseen, long-horizon tasks in simulations and real-world settings.

Conclusion: SkillWrapper bridges the gap between low-level sensory data and abstract planning, proving efficient for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Generalizing from individual skill executions to solving long-horizon tasks remains a core challenge in building autonomous agents. A promising direction is learning high-level, symbolic abstractions of the low-level skills of the agents, enabling reasoning and planning independent of the low-level state space. Among possible high-level representations, object-centric skill abstraction with symbolic predicates has been proven to be efficient because of its compatibility with domain-independent planners. Recent advances in foundation models have made it possible to generate symbolic predicates that operate on raw sensory inputs, a process we call generative predicate invention, to facilitate downstream abstraction learning. However, it remains unclear which formal properties the learned representations must satisfy, and how they can be learned to guarantee these properties. In this paper, we address both questions by presenting a formal theory of generative predicate invention for skill abstraction, resulting in symbolic operators that can be used for provably sound and complete planning. Within this framework, we propose SkillWrapper, a method that leverages foundation models to actively collect robot data and learn human-interpretable, plannable representations of black-box skills, using only RGB image observations. Our extensive empirical evaluation in simulation and on real robots shows that SkillWrapper learns abstract representations that enable solving unseen, long-horizon tasks in the real world with black-box skills.

*Shangyuan Yuan,Preston Fairchild,Yu Mei,Xinyu Zhou,Xiaobo Tan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision-based framework for soft robot shape reconstruction that is markerless and training-free, leveraging natural surface features for reliable operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-based methods for soft robots are limited by reliance on complex setups, specific backgrounds, or large datasets which hinder real-world applicability.

Method: A hierarchical matching strategy is used to align local partitions and perform global kinematic optimization based on the robot’s surface features. Only initial 3D reconstruction is required.

Result: Experimental results show a 2.6% average tip error during real-time operation with stable performance in closed-loop control tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective in real-world environments, offering a low-cost, robust, and reliable solution for soft robot shape tracking.

Abstract: Accurate shape reconstruction is essential for precise control and reliable operation of soft robots. Compared to sensor-based approaches, vision-based methods offer advantages in cost, simplicity, and ease of deployment. However, existing vision-based methods often rely on complex camera setups, specific backgrounds, or large-scale training datasets, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a vision-based, markerless, and training-free framework for soft robot shape reconstruction that directly leverages the robot's natural surface appearance. These surface features act as implicit visual markers, enabling a hierarchical matching strategy that decouples local partition alignment from global kinematic optimization. Requiring only an initial 3D reconstruction and kinematic alignment, our method achieves real-time shape tracking across diverse environments while maintaining robustness to occlusions and variations in camera viewpoints. Experimental validation on a continuum soft robot demonstrates an average tip error of 2.6% during real-time operation, as well as stable performance in practical closed-loop control tasks. These results highlight the potential of the proposed approach for reliable, low-cost deployment in dynamic real-world settings.

*Nuno Soares,António Grilo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes APULSE, an advanced algorithm for solving large-scale RCSPP efficiently, offering faster and near-optimal results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RCSPP is critical for applications like autonomous navigation but struggles with scalability on large, dense graphs, particularly needed in scenarios like UGV mission planning.

Method: APULSE combines A* heuristic-driven best-first search with Pulse-style pruning and time-bucketing for efficient state-space reduction.

Result: APULSE outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, consistently achieving near-optimal solutions with significantly higher speed and robustness, especially on large-scale problems.

Conclusion: APULSE enhances scalability for RCSPP in complex environments, enabling real-time decision support and dynamic replanning.

Abstract: The resource-constrained shortest path problem (RCSPP) is a fundamental NP-hard optimization challenge with broad applications, from network routing to autonomous navigation. This problem involves finding a path that minimizes a primary cost subject to a budget on a secondary resource. While various RCSPP solvers exist, they often face critical scalability limitations when applied to the large, dense graphs characteristic of complex, real-world scenarios, making them impractical for time-critical planning. This challenge is particularly acute in domains like mission planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which demand solutions on large-scale terrain graphs. This paper introduces APULSE, a hybrid label-setting algorithm designed to efficiently solve the RCSPP on such challenging graphs. APULSE integrates a best-first search guided by an A* heuristic with aggressive, Pulse-style pruning mechanisms and a time-bucketing strategy for effective state-space reduction. A computational study, using a large-scale UGV planning scenario, benchmarks APULSE against state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that APULSE consistently finds near-optimal solutions while being orders of magnitude faster and more robust, particularly on large problem instances where competing methods fail. This superior scalability establishes APULSE as an effective solution for RCSPP in complex, large-scale environments, enabling capabilities such as interactive decision support and dynamic replanning.

*Eashan Vytla,Bhavanishankar Kalavakolanu,Andrew Perrault,Matthew McCrink*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of applying Dreamer RL to aerial robots by proposing a physics-informed world model approach for enhancing policy performance and model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial robots require robust control systems to operate efficiently in dynamic and adverse environments. Current reinforcement learning methods, particularly Dreamer, face limitations such as sample inefficiency and poor generalization, necessitating new approaches to improve their applicability.

Method: The paper introduces a physics-informed world model that predicts net forces and moments on a quadcopter. These predictions are integrated using a 6-DOF Runge-Kutta integrator to simulate future states, comparing this method against traditional RNN-based world models.

Result: While both models performed adequately on training data, neither succeeded in generalizing effectively to novel trajectories, leading to rapid divergence during state rollouts and preventing policy convergence.

Conclusion: The findings reveal that improving generalization capabilities in world models remains a significant challenge for reinforcement learning in aerial systems, highlighting the necessity for further research in this area.

Abstract: Current control algorithms for aerial robots struggle with robustness in dynamic environments and adverse conditions. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong potential in handling these challenges while remaining sample-efficient. Additionally, Dreamer has demonstrated that online model-based RL can be achieved using a recurrent world model trained on replay buffer data. However, applying Dreamer to aerial systems has been quite challenging due to its sample inefficiency and poor generalization of dynamics models. Our work explores a physics-informed approach to world model learning and improves policy performance. The world model treats the quadcopter as a free-body system and predicts the net forces and moments acting on it, which are then passed through a 6-DOF Runge-Kutta integrator (RK4) to predict future state rollouts. In this paper, we compare this physics-informed method to a standard RNN-based world model. Although both models perform well on the training data, we observed that they fail to generalize to new trajectories, leading to rapid divergence in state rollouts, preventing policy convergence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the intelligence of autonomous aerial vehicles using LLMs while addressing their limitations in spatial reasoning and reproducibility.

Method: A two-stage framework involving diversified action space, physics-informed reward functions, and MCTS-based fine-tuning of LLMs.

Result: Validated efficiency and superiority through simulations and real-world experiments, showing improved inference acceleration and solution quality.

Conclusion: Skypilot successfully addresses the challenges of grounding LLMs in physical reality for better AAV operations. Experiments demonstrate its practical advantages.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) have played a pivotal role in coverage operations and search missions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities to augment AAV intelligence. These advances help address complex challenges like area coverage optimization, dynamic path planning, and adaptive decision-making. However, the absence of physical grounding in LLMs leads to hallucination and reproducibility problems in spatial reasoning and decision-making. To tackle these issues, we present Skypilot, an LLM-enhanced two-stage framework that grounds language models in physical reality by integrating monte carlo tree search (MCTS). In the first stage, we introduce a diversified action space that encompasses generate, regenerate, fine-tune, and evaluate operations, coupled with physics-informed reward functions to ensure trajectory feasibility. In the second stage, we fine-tune Qwen3-4B on 23,000 MCTS-generated samples, achieving substantial inference acceleration while maintaining solution quality. Extensive numerical simulations and real-world flight experiments validate the efficiency and superiority of our proposed approach.

*Shuai Zhang,Jingsong Mu,Cancan Zhao,Leiqi Tian,Zhijun Xing,Bo Ouyang,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces AIA-UltraNeRF, an acoustic-impedance-aware NeRF model for ultrasound imaging, integrated with a robotic system to enhance reconstruction and localization speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous NeRF-based ultrasound reconstruction methods fail to account for acoustic impedance, which plays a crucial role in ultrasound imaging quality. Localization methods face limitations due to dependencies on initial pose selection.

Method: The method involves creating a robotic ultrasound system (RUSS) with an acoustic-impedance-aware NeRF model (AIA-UltraNeRF) that uses hash-encoded 3D spatial coordinates for ultrasound map reconstruction. A dual-supervised network hashes and encodes rendered images for efficient localization, bypassing image re-rendering.

Result: AIA-UltraNeRF demonstrated improved reconstruction and localization speeds, achieving inference speeds 9.9 times faster than vanilla NeRF. It effectively characterized acoustic impedance, leading to better representation of ultrasound image colors in experiments.

Conclusion: Acoustic impedance is shown to be critical for effective ultrasound imaging and localization tasks. AIA-UltraNeRF and the robotic ultrasound system surpass traditional methods in speed and quality, enabling operator-independent workflows and decoupling scanning from diagnostics.

Abstract: Neural radiance field (NeRF) is a promising approach for reconstruction and new view synthesis. However, previous NeRF-based reconstruction methods overlook the critical role of acoustic impedance in ultrasound imaging. Localization methods face challenges related to local minima due to the selection of initial poses. In this study, we design a robotic ultrasound system (RUSS) with an acoustic-impedance-aware ultrasound NeRF (AIA-UltraNeRF) to decouple the scanning and diagnostic processes. Specifically, AIA-UltraNeRF models a continuous function of hash-encoded spatial coordinates for the 3D ultrasound map, allowing for the storage of acoustic impedance without dense sampling. This approach accelerates both reconstruction and inference speeds. We then propose a dual-supervised network that leverages teacher and student models to hash-encode the rendered ultrasound images from the reconstructed map. AIA-UltraNeRF retrieves the most similar hash values without the need to render images again, providing an offline initial image position for localization. Moreover, we develop a RUSS with a spherical remote center of motion mechanism to hold the probe, implementing operator-independent scanning modes that separate image acquisition from diagnostic workflows. Experimental results on a phantom and human subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of acoustic impedance in implicitly characterizing the color of ultrasound images. AIAUltraNeRF achieves both reconstruction and localization with inference speeds that are 9.9 faster than those of vanilla NeRF.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes MicCheck, an acoustic sensing method using a Bluetooth pin microphone for contact-rich robotic tasks, demonstrating improved performance in manipulation and material classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of vision-based imitation learning in capturing fine interaction cues by introducing a tactile sensing method that's both cost-effective and easy to integrate.

Method: MicCheck repurposes an off-the-shelf Bluetooth pin microphone as a contact sensor, integrated into a 3D-printed gripper insert, streaming audio via standard USB technology.

Result: MicCheck achieves 92.9% accuracy in material classification and increases manipulation success rates, particularly in tasks such as picking, pouring, unplugging, and sorting.

Conclusion: MicCheck offers a practical solution for acoustic contact sensing, enabling low-cost and accessible robotic setups with improved performance in contact-rich tasks.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation tasks are contact-rich, yet most imitation learning (IL) approaches rely primarily on vision, which struggles to capture stiffness, roughness, slip, and other fine interaction cues. Tactile signals can address this gap, but existing sensors often require expensive, delicate, or integration-heavy hardware. In this work, we introduce MicCheck, a plug-and-play acoustic sensing approach that repurposes an off-the-shelf Bluetooth pin microphone as a low-cost contact sensor. The microphone clips into a 3D-printed gripper insert and streams audio via a standard USB receiver, requiring no custom electronics or drivers. Despite its simplicity, the microphone provides signals informative enough for both perception and control. In material classification, it achieves 92.9% accuracy on a 10-class benchmark across four interaction types (tap, knock, slow press, drag). For manipulation, integrating pin microphone into an IL pipeline with open source hardware improves the success rate on picking and pouring task from 0.40 to 0.80 and enables reliable execution of contact-rich skills such as unplugging and sound-based sorting. Compared with high-resolution tactile sensors, pin microphones trade spatial detail for cost and ease of integration, offering a practical pathway for deploying acoustic contact sensing in low-cost robot setups.

Motivation: To overcome the limitations of data-driven approaches lacking physical interpretability and model-based approaches requiring prior knowledge and being computationally expensive for soft continuum robots.

Method: The method introduces the Attention Broadcast Decoder (ABCD) module for autoencoder-based latent dynamics learning, generating attention maps and coupling them with 2D oscillator networks for visual dynamics representation.

Result: The approach significantly reduces prediction error (5.7x for Koopman operators, 3.5x for oscillator networks), enables smooth extrapolation beyond training data, and discovers physical properties autonomously.

Conclusion: ABCD models offer a fully data-driven framework delivering compact, accurate, and interpretable dynamics for SCRs, ideal for control purposes.

Abstract: Data-driven learning of soft continuum robot (SCR) dynamics from high-dimensional observations offers flexibility but often lacks physical interpretability, while model-based approaches require prior knowledge and can be computationally expensive. We bridge this gap by introducing (1) the Attention Broadcast Decoder (ABCD), a plug-and-play module for autoencoder-based latent dynamics learning that generates pixel-accurate attention maps localizing each latent dimension's contribution while filtering static backgrounds. (2) By coupling these attention maps to 2D oscillator networks, we enable direct on-image visualization of learned dynamics (masses, stiffness, and forces) without prior knowledge. We validate our approach on single- and double-segment SCRs, demonstrating that ABCD-based models significantly improve multi-step prediction accuracy: 5.7x error reduction for Koopman operators and 3.5x for oscillator networks on the two-segment robot. The learned oscillator network autonomously discovers a chain structure of oscillators. Unlike standard methods, ABCD models enable smooth latent space extrapolation beyond training data. This fully data-driven approach yields compact, physically interpretable models suitable for control applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unmanned aerial vehicle planning strategy with optimization heuristics to improve search effectiveness in dense forest terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance search and rescue missions in occluded environments like dense forests, improving UAV-based exploration strategies.

Method: Development of an efficient algorithm with two novel heuristics (geometry and visibility) for optimizing camera viewpoints to improve object detection.

Result: Visibility heuristic showed better performance, identifying over 90% of hidden objects and achieving 10% better detection rates versus the geometry heuristic.

Conclusion: Visibility heuristic outperforms geometry heuristic in improving UAV-based search performance, making it effective for missions in occluded terrains.

Abstract: Search and rescue missions are often critical following sudden natural disasters or in high-risk environmental situations. The most challenging search and rescue missions involve difficult-to-access terrains, such as dense forests with high occlusion. Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles for exploration can significantly enhance search effectiveness, facilitate access to challenging environments, and reduce search time. However, in dense forests, the effectiveness of unmanned aerial vehicles depends on their ability to capture clear views of the ground, necessitating a robust search strategy to optimize camera positioning and perspective. This work presents an optimized planning strategy and an efficient algorithm for the next best view problem in occluded environments. Two novel optimization heuristics, a geometry heuristic, and a visibility heuristic, are proposed to enhance search performance by selecting optimal camera viewpoints. Comparative evaluations in both simulated and real-world settings reveal that the visibility heuristic achieves greater performance, identifying over 90% of hidden objects in simulated forests and offering 10% better detection rates than the geometry heuristic. Additionally, real-world experiments demonstrate that the visibility heuristic provides better coverage under the canopy, highlighting its potential for improving search and rescue missions in occluded environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a closed-form upper bound on the Hausdorff distance for truncated minimal robust positively invariant sets, providing an explicit quantification of truncation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of computable expressions quantifying truncation error in existing minimal robust positively invariant set approximations.

Method: The paper derives an explicit formula for the Hausdorff distance based on a geometric and analytic approach, leveraging the contraction factor and disturbance set.

Result: The derived bound is an analytical formula requiring no iterative computations, demonstrating convergence properties and validated through experiments.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for tighter horizon selection in invariant set computations and tube-based MPC design through a novel, precise bound.

Abstract: This paper establishes the first explicit and closed-form upper bound on the Hausdorff distance between the truncated minimal robust positively invariant (mRPI) set and its infinite-horizon limit. While existing mRPI approximations guarantee asymptotic convergence through geometric or norm-based arguments, none provides a computable expression that quantifies the truncation error for a given horizon. We show that the error satisfies \( d_H(\mathcal{E}_N,\mathcal{E}_\infty) \le r_W\,γ^{N+1}/(1-γ), \) where $γ<1$ is the induced-norm contraction factor and $r_W$ depends only on the disturbance set. The bound is fully analytic, requires no iterative set computations, and directly characterizes the decay rate of the truncated Minkowski series. We further demonstrate that the choice of vector norm serves as a design parameter that accelerates convergence, enabling substantially tighter horizon selection for robust invariant-set computations and tube-based MPC. Numerical experiments validate the sharpness, scalability, and practical relevance of the proposed bound.

TL;DR: The paper presents methods to expand electromagnetic navigation system (eMNS) workspaces through motion-centric control strategies, cutting current requirements significantly while achieving stable magnetic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the constrained workspace problem in electromagnetically driven surgeries due to power and thermal limits.

Method: It proposes a system-level control strategy leveraging torque/force objectives, energy optimization, real-time estimation, dynamic feedback, and advanced components.

Result: The strategy reduces required currents (e.g., 0.1-0.2 A against 8-14 A in conventional methods), enabling multi-agent magnetic actuation and stable operation at larger distances.

Conclusion: The findings highlight feedback control design as key to scalable, efficient, and clinically practical eMNS applications.

Abstract: Electromagnetic navigation systems (eMNS) enable a number of magnetically guided surgical procedures. A challenge in magnetically manipulating surgical tools is that the effective workspace of an eMNS is often severely constrained by power and thermal limits. We show that system-level control design significantly expands this workspace by reducing the currents needed to achieve a desired motion. We identified five key system approaches that enable this expansion: (i) motion-centric torque/force objectives, (ii) energy-optimal current allocation, (iii) real-time pose estimation, (iv) dynamic feedback, and (v) high-bandwidth eMNS components. As a result, we stabilize a 3D inverted pendulum on an eight-coil OctoMag eMNS with significantly lower currents (0.1-0.2 A vs. 8-14 A), by replacing a field-centric field-alignment strategy with a motion-centric torque/force-based approach. We generalize to multi-agent control by simultaneously stabilizing two inverted pendulums within a shared workspace, exploiting magnetic-field nonlinearity and coil redundancy for independent actuation. A structured analysis compares the electromagnetic workspaces of both paradigms and examines current-allocation strategies that map motion objectives to coil currents. Cross-platform evaluation of the clinically oriented Navion eMNS further demonstrates substantial workspace expansion by maintaining stable balancing at distances up to 50 cm from the coils. The results demonstrate that feedback is a practical path to scalable, efficient, and clinically relevant magnetic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots are prone to falls during bipedal locomotion, leading to damage to expensive components, which is a major hindrance to their deployment.

Method: SafeFall integrates a GRU-based fall predictor for timely detection and a reinforcement learning policy tailored for damage mitigation based on robot-specific vulnerabilities.

Result: Validated on the Unitree G1 humanoid, SafeFall reduced peak contact forces by 68.3%, peak joint torques by 78.4%, and eliminated 99.3% of collisions with sensitive components.

Conclusion: SafeFall enables humanoid robots to fail safely, improving their reliability and facilitating adoption in complex real-world tasks.

Abstract: Bipedal locomotion makes humanoid robots inherently prone to falls, causing catastrophic damage to the expensive sensors, actuators, and structural components of full-scale robots. To address this critical barrier to real-world deployment, we present \method, a framework that learns to predict imminent, unavoidable falls and execute protective maneuvers to minimize hardware damage. SafeFall is designed to operate seamlessly alongside existing nominal controller, ensuring no interference during normal operation. It combines two synergistic components: a lightweight, GRU-based fall predictor that continuously monitors the robot's state, and a reinforcement learning policy for damage mitigation. The protective policy remains dormant until the predictor identifies a fall as unavoidable, at which point it activates to take control and execute a damage-minimizing response. This policy is trained with a novel, damage-aware reward function that incorporates the robot's specific structural vulnerabilities, learning to shield critical components like the head and hands while absorbing energy with more robust parts of its body. Validated on a full-scale Unitree G1 humanoid, SafeFall demonstrated significant performance improvements over unprotected falls. It reduced peak contact forces by 68.3\%, peak joint torques by 78.4\%, and eliminated 99.3\% of collisions with vulnerable components. By enabling humanoids to fail safely, SafeFall provides a crucial safety net that allows for more aggressive experiments and accelerates the deployment of these robots in complex, real-world environments.

Conclusion: Splatblox demonstrates robust semantic and geometric reasoning, excelling in navigating complex outdoor tasks, highlighting its potential for real-world autonomous systems.

Abstract: We present Splatblox, a real-time system for autonomous navigation in outdoor environments with dense vegetation, irregular obstacles, and complex terrain. Our method fuses segmented RGB images and LiDAR point clouds using Gaussian Splatting to construct a traversability-aware Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) that jointly encodes geometry and semantics. Updated online, this field enables semantic reasoning to distinguish traversable vegetation (e.g., tall grass) from rigid obstacles (e.g., trees), while LiDAR ensures 360-degree geometric coverage for extended planning horizons. We validate Splatblox on a quadruped robot and demonstrate transfer to a wheeled platform. In field trials across vegetation-rich scenarios, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods with over 50% higher success rate, 40% fewer freezing incidents, 5% shorter paths, and up to 13% faster time to goal, while supporting long-range missions up to 100 meters.

*Cem Bilaloglu,Tobias Löw,Sylvain Calinon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes Diffused Orientation Fields (DOF) for transferring tasks across curved objects in robotics, addressing challenges posed by geometry variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in transferring object-centric tasks across curved objects due to geometry and position dependency, as opposed to planar surfaces.

Method: The approach uses Diffused Orientation Fields (DOF), a smooth representation of local reference frames generated by diffusion processes based on partial differential equations using sparse keypoint correspondences.

Result: The method successfully transfers complex tasks like inspection, slicing, and peeling across varied curved objects, even under perturbations in geometry, topology, and localization.

Conclusion: DOF enables effective skill transfer for robotics across curved objects, leveraging smooth local frames and sparse correspondences for successful task execution.

Abstract: Curved objects pose a fundamental challenge for skill transfer in robotics: unlike planar surfaces, they do not admit a global reference frame. As a result, task-relevant directions such as "toward" or "along" the surface vary with position and geometry, making object-centric tasks difficult to transfer across shapes. To address this, we introduce an approach using Diffused Orientation Fields (DOF), a smooth representation of local reference frames, for transfer learning of tasks across curved objects. By expressing manipulation tasks in these smoothly varying local frames, we reduce the problem of transferring tasks across curved objects to establishing sparse keypoint correspondences.

*Hannah Lee,James D. Motes,Marco Morales,Nancy M. Amato*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper studies the impact of different constraints on multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) and multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) algorithms, categorizing and guiding their usage for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to optimize the design and application of MAPF and MRMP algorithms by thoroughly analyzing constraint-based search behaviors.

Method: The authors categorize constraints as "conservative" or "aggressive" and evaluate their performance on CBS and CBSw/P under hybrid grid-roadmap representations with varying resolutions.

Result: Aggressive constraints (priority-based) solve more cases under higher agent counts and resolutions, while conservative constraints offer stronger solution quality when feasible.

Conclusion: The study provides a decision-making flowchart to assist users in selecting constraints based on problem characteristics and outlines recommendations for MRMP design, highlighting the significance of topological features.

Abstract: This study informs the design of future multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) and multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) algorithms by guiding choices based on constraint classification for constraint-based search algorithms. We categorize constraints as conservative or aggressive and provide insights into their search behavior, focusing specifically on vanilla Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Conflict-Based Search with Priorities (CBSw/P). Under a hybrid grid-roadmap representation with varying resolution, we observe that aggressive (priority constraint) formulations tend to solve more instances as agent count or resolution increases, whereas conservative (motion constraint) formulations yield stronger solution quality when both succeed. Findings are synthesized in a decision flowchart, aiding users in selecting suitable constraints. Recommendations extend to Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), emphasizing the importance of considering topological features alongside problem, solution, and representation features.

### [739] [How to Train Your Latent Control Barrier Function: Smooth Safety Filtering Under Hard-to-Model Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18606)
*Kensuke Nakamura,Arun L. Bishop,Steven Man,Aaron M. Johnson,Zachary Manchester,Andrea Bajcsy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces LatentCBF for safe visuomotor control, improving over prior methods that undermined task performance by proposing smooth safety filtering tailored for real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent safety filters for visuomotor control under hard-to-model constraints rely on switching between policies, compromising performance. Existing methods with HJ reachability and RL approximations are incompatible for smooth safety filtering.

Method: The proposed LatentCBF leverages gradient penalties to create smooth margin functions (avoiding discontinuous jumps) and a value-training procedure combining nominal and safety policy data for accurate control barrier functions.

Result: The LatentCBF method achieves smooth safety filtering and doubles task completion rates compared to prior switching methods.

Conclusion: LatentCBF surmounts key limitations in existing safety control approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness for safety and task performance in visuomotor applications through both theory and experiments.

Abstract: Latent safety filters extend Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability to operate on latent state representations and dynamics learned directly from high-dimensional observations, enabling safe visuomotor control under hard-to-model constraints. However, existing methods implement "least-restrictive" filtering that discretely switch between nominal and safety policies, potentially undermining the task performance that makes modern visuomotor policies valuable. While reachability value functions can, in principle, be adapted to be control barrier functions (CBFs) for smooth optimization-based filtering, we theoretically and empirically show that current latent-space learning methods produce fundamentally incompatible value functions. We identify two sources of incompatibility: First, in HJ reachability, failures are encoded via a "margin function" in latent space, whose sign indicates whether or not a latent is in the constraint set. However, representing the margin function as a classifier yields saturated value functions that exhibit discontinuous jumps. We prove that the value function's Lipschitz constant scales linearly with the margin function's Lipschitz constant, revealing that smooth CBFs require smooth margins. Second, reinforcement learning (RL) approximations trained solely on safety policy data yield inaccurate value estimates for nominal policy actions, precisely where CBF filtering needs them. We propose the LatentCBF, which addresses both challenges through gradient penalties that lead to smooth margin functions without additional labeling, and a value-training procedure that mixes data from both nominal and safety policy distributions. Experiments on simulated benchmarks and hardware with a vision-based manipulation policy demonstrate that LatentCBF enables smooth safety filtering while doubling the task-completion rate over prior switching methods.

*Litian Gong,Fatemeh Bahrani,Yutai Zhou,Amin Banayeeanzade,Jiachen Li,Erdem Biyik*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AutoFocus-IL improves visual imitation learning by leveraging vision-language models to guide attention towards task-relevant features, outperforming supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve data efficiency and generalization in visual imitation learning by focusing on task-relevant features and avoiding reliance on costly supervision such as human gaze or saliency annotations.

Method: AutoFocus-IL uses vision-language models to create temporal saliency maps highlighting causal visual signals and suppressing distractors, which are then applied to behavior cloning policies for attention guidance.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance to standard behavior cloning and supervised baselines in both CARLA simulation and real-robot tasks.

Conclusion: AutoFocus-IL offers a cost-effective and highly effective method for guiding attention in visual imitation learning.

Abstract: AutoFocus-IL is a simple yet effective method to improve data efficiency and generalization in visual imitation learning by guiding policies to attend to task-relevant features rather than distractors and spurious correlations. Although saliency regularization has emerged as a promising way to achieve this, existing approaches typically require costly supervision such as human gaze data or manual saliency annotations. In contrast, AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. These maps are then used to regularize behavior cloning policies, yielding stronger alignment between visual attention and task-relevant cues. Experiments in both the CARLA simulator and real-robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that AutoFocus-IL not only outperforms standard behavior cloning but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that assume privileged access to human supervision, such as gaze data. Code, datasets, and trained policy videos are available at https://AutoFocus-IL.github.io/.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances trajectory tracking of marine vehicles under diverse environmental disturbances, balancing robustness and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are easily influenced by environmental disturbances such as wind and waves, making accurate trajectory tracking a persistent challenge in dynamic marine conditions.

This design enables adaptive and robust control while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations in numerical simulations, the Virtual RobotX (VRX) simulator, and real-world field experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior tracking accuracy under various disturbance scenarios compared with existing approaches.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scalable GNSS-based tracking system for marine robots using visual detection, multi-object tracking, and Kalman filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine robots face challenges in localization due to unreliable GNSS signals and shortcomings of traditional methods like error accumulation or infrastructure dependence.

Method: The system combines visual detection, GNSS-based triangulation, Extended Kalman Filter, and a cross-drone tracking ID alignment algorithm for multi-drone tracking.

Result: The proposed system is validated in diverse complex environments, demonstrating scalability and robustness for real-time GNSS-based localization.

Conclusion: The presented method offers an efficient and reliable solution for GNSS localization in surface and near-surface marine robots, overcoming traditional limitations.

Abstract: Accurate localization is essential for marine robotics, yet Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are unreliable or unavailable even at a very short distance below the water surface. Traditional alternatives, such as inertial navigation, Doppler Velocity Loggers (DVL), SLAM, and acoustic methods, suffer from error accumulation, high computational demands, or infrastructure dependence. In this work, we present a scalable multi-drone GNSS-based tracking system for surface and near-surface marine robots. Our approach combines efficient visual detection, lightweight multi-object tracking, GNSS-based triangulation, and a confidence-weighted Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to provide stable GNSS estimation in real time. We further introduce a cross-drone tracking ID alignment algorithm that enforces global consistency across views, enabling robust multi-robot tracking with redundant aerial coverage. We validate our system in diversified complex settings to show the scalability and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

*Xueyan Oh,Leonard Loh,Shaohui Foong,Zhong Bao Andy Koh,Kow Leong Ng,Poh Kang Tan,Pei Lin Pearlin Toh,U-Xuan Tan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to automate aircraft exterior damage inspection using a pan-tilt-zoom camera without infrastructure, achieving accurate camera pose estimation through a neural network fine-tuned on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection processes for aircraft damage are time-consuming and highly dependent on human labor, which is unsuitable for quick turnover operations at airports. The need for automation to reduce downtime and reliance on humans drives this research.

Method: The authors propose a camera pose estimation and localisation approach using a pan-tilt-zoom camera and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks fine-tuned on synthetic images. They use domain randomisation for data generation and modify the loss function leveraging aircraft geometry.

Result: Experimental results show accurate camera pose estimation errors of less than 0.24 m and 2 degrees using a pan-tilt-zoom camera system on real aircraft.

Conclusion: This infrastructure-free approach simplifies deployment, supports real-world operations, and addresses constraints in airport environments for automated aircraft damage inspection.

Abstract: General Visual Inspection is a manual inspection process regularly used to detect and localise obvious damage on the exterior of commercial aircraft. There has been increasing demand to perform this process at the boarding gate to minimise the downtime of the aircraft and automating this process is desired to reduce the reliance on human labour. Automating this typically requires estimating a camera's pose with respect to the aircraft for initialisation but most existing localisation methods require infrastructure, which is very challenging in uncontrolled outdoor environments and within the limited turnover time (approximately 2 hours) on an airport tarmac. Additionally, many airlines and airports do not allow contact with the aircraft's surface or using UAVs for inspection between flights, and restrict access to commercial aircraft. Hence, this paper proposes an on-site method that is infrastructure-free and easy to deploy for estimating a pan-tilt-zoom camera's pose and localising scan images. This method initialises using the same pan-tilt-zoom camera used for the inspection task by utilising a Deep Convolutional Neural Network fine-tuned on only synthetic images to predict its own pose. We apply domain randomisation to generate the dataset for fine-tuning the network and modify its loss function by leveraging aircraft geometry to improve accuracy. We also propose a workflow for initialisation, scan path planning, and precise localisation of images captured from a pan-tilt-zoom camera. We evaluate and demonstrate our approach through experiments with real aircraft, achieving root-mean-square camera pose estimation errors of less than 0.24 m and 2 degrees for all real scenes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Delay-Aware ADMM (DA-ADMM) approach to improve multi-robot coordination under realistic communication delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in coordinating multi-robot systems under communication delays, focusing on scalability and robustness in dynamic, real-time scenarios.

Method: It proposes DA-ADMM, which adapts penalty parameters based on real-time delay statistics, prioritizing recent updates during optimizations.

Result: Experiments in 2D and 3D environments showed that DA-ADMM significantly outperforms traditional methods in robustness, success rates, and solution quality under various delay conditions.

Conclusion: DA-ADMM offers a robust, efficient, and principled solution for motion planning in multi-robot systems, even under imperfect communication.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of coordinating multi-robot systems under realistic communication delays using distributed optimization. We focus on consensus ADMM as a scalable framework for generating collision-free, dynamically feasible motion plans in both trajectory optimization and receding-horizon control settings. In practice, however, these algorithms are sensitive to penalty tuning or adaptation schemes (e.g. residual balancing and adaptive parameter heuristics) that do not explicitly consider delays. To address this, we introduce a Delay-Aware ADMM (DA-ADMM) variant that adapts penalty parameters based on real-time delay statistics, allowing agents to down-weight stale information and prioritize recent updates during consensus and dual updates. Through extensive simulations in 2D and 3D environments with double-integrator, Dubins-car, and drone dynamics, we show that DA-ADMM significantly improves robustness, success rate, and solution quality compared to fixed-parameter, residual-balancing, and fixed-constraint baselines. Our results highlight that performance degradation is not solely determined by delay length or frequency, but by the optimizer's ability to contextually reason over delayed information. The proposed DA-ADMM achieves consistently better coordination performance across a wide range of delay conditions, offering a principled and efficient mechanism for resilient multi-robot motion planning under imperfect communication.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new topological map updating method for robotic exploration based on Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD), addressing issues of accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of real-time updating of detailed and accurate environmental topological maps for robotic exploration tasks.

Method: The method involves denoising newly observed areas, hierarchical GVD generation, node clustering with connectivity constraints, and a frontier extraction method. It also introduces a cost function for real-time viewpoint adjustments.

Result: The proposed system improves efficiency, reduces path backtracking, ensures reachability of frontiers, and demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Conclusion: The approach significantly enhances robotic exploration tasks by providing a more efficient, accurate, and adaptable topological map updating mechanism.

Abstract: Topological maps are more suitable than metric maps for robotic exploration tasks. However, real-time updating of accurate and detail-rich environmental topological maps remains a challenge. This paper presents a topological map updating method based on the Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD). First, the newly observed areas are denoised to avoid low-efficiency GVD nodes misleading the topological structure. Subsequently, a multi-granularity hierarchical GVD generation method is designed to control the sampling granularity at both global and local levels. This not only ensures the accuracy of the topological structure but also enhances the ability to capture detail features, reduces the probability of path backtracking, and ensures no overlap between GVDs through the maintenance of a coverage map, thereby improving GVD utilization efficiency. Second, a node clustering method with connectivity constraints and a connectivity method based on a switching mechanism are designed to avoid the generation of unreachable nodes and erroneous nodes caused by obstacle attraction. A special cache structure is used to store all connectivity information, thereby improving exploration efficiency. Finally, to address the issue of frontiers misjudgment caused by obstacles within the scope of GVD units, a frontiers extraction method based on morphological dilation is designed to effectively ensure the reachability of frontiers. On this basis, a lightweight cost function is used to assess and switch to the next viewpoint in real time. This allows the robot to quickly adjust its strategy when signs of path backtracking appear, thereby escaping the predicament and increasing exploration flexibility. And the performance of system for exploration task is verified through comparative tests with SOTA methods.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method utilizing foundation models for manipulator-based UV surface disinfection, reducing human intervention and eliminating the need for extensive model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient, automated UV surface disinfection methods to overcome challenges like complicated automation, large-scale impracticality due to deep learning-based methods, and ensuring scene understanding to prevent unintended UV exposure.

Method: The approach employs foundation models for simplified surface selection and VLM-assisted segmentation refinement to detect and exclude thin/small non-target objects.

Result: The method achieves a success rate of over 92% in correctly segmenting target and non-target surfaces, validated via real-world experiments involving simulated UV light and manipulators.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates practical potential for real-world manipulator-based UV disinfection applications by enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) germicidal radiation is an established non-contact method for surface disinfection in medical environments. Traditional approaches require substantial human intervention to define disinfection areas, complicating automation, while deep learning-based methods often need extensive fine-tuning and large datasets, which can be impractical for large-scale deployment. Additionally, these methods often do not address scene understanding for partial surface disinfection, which is crucial for avoiding unintended UV exposure. We propose a solution that leverages foundation models to simplify surface selection for manipulator-based UV disinfection, reducing human involvement and removing the need for model training. Additionally, we propose a VLM-assisted segmentation refinement to detect and exclude thin and small non-target objects, showing that this reduces mis-segmentation errors. Our approach achieves over 92\% success rate in correctly segmenting target and non-target surfaces, and real-world experiments with a manipulator and simulated UV light demonstrate its practical potential for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of head instability in wheeled bipedal robots navigating uneven terrain, which affects sensor accuracy and fragile payloads.

Method: A model-based ground force estimation method coupled with an admittance control algorithm was developed to improve stability and terrain adaptability.

Result: Simulation experiments demonstrated real-time performance of the force estimator and improved robustness on uneven terrain.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential for active stabilization techniques to improve operational stability of wheeled bipedal robots in challenging environments.

Abstract: Wheeled bipedal robots are emerging as flexible platforms for field exploration. However, head instability induced by uneven terrain can degrade the accuracy of onboard sensors or damage fragile payloads. Existing research primarily focuses on stabilizing the mobile platform but overlooks active stabilization of the head in the world frame, resulting in vertical oscillations that undermine overall stability. To address this challenge, we developed a model-based ground force estimation method for our 6-degree-of-freedom wheeled bipedal robot. Leveraging these force estimates, we implemented an admittance control algorithm to enhance terrain adaptability. Simulation experiments validated the real-time performance of the force estimator and the robot's robustness when traversing uneven terrain.

Conclusion: The proposed SP-VINS offers a superior alternative to SOTA methods by balancing computational efficiency with long-term localization accuracy through innovative mapping and filter techniques.

Abstract: Filter-based visual inertial navigation system (VINS) has attracted mobile-robot researchers for the good balance between accuracy and efficiency, but its limited mapping quality hampers long-term high-accuracy state estimation. To this end, we first propose a novel filter-based stereo VINS, differing from traditional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems based on 3D map, which performs efficient loop closure constraints with implicit environmental map composed of keyframes and 2D keypoints. Secondly, we proposed a hybrid residual filter framework that combines landmark reprojection and ray constraints to construct a unified Jacobian matrix for measurement updates. Finally, considering the degraded environment, we incorporated the camera-IMU extrinsic parameters into visual description to achieve online calibration. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that the proposed SP-VINS achieves high computational efficiency while maintaining long-term high-accuracy localization performance, and is superior to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MergeVLA, a vision-language-action architecture designed to solve the challenge of merging multiple task-specific models effectively, achieving strong generalization across tasks and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key motivation is the difficulty of extending current VLA models to multi-skill settings without losing performance due to conflicts in task-specific tuning.

Method: The authors propose MergeVLA, which uses sparsely activated LoRA adapters via task masks and replaces self-attention with cross-attention-only blocks in action experts, preserving modularity and enabling adaptive task inference via a test-time task router.

Result: The proposed MergeVLA demonstrates task performance that matches or surpasses fine-tuned task-specific experts across various benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, RoboTwin, and real robotic arm settings.

Conclusion: MergeVLA successfully addresses the challenges of merging VLA models by designing its architecture for modularity and adaptability, providing robust performance across tasks, embodiments, and environments.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models reformulate vision-language models by tuning them with millions of robotic demonstrations. While they perform well when fine-tuned for a single embodiment or task family, extending them to multi-skill settings remains challenging: directly merging VLA experts trained on different tasks results in near-zero success rates. This raises a fundamental question: what prevents VLAs from mastering multiple skills within one model? With an empirical decomposition of learnable parameters during VLA fine-tuning, we identify two key sources of non-mergeability: (1) Finetuning drives LoRA adapters in the VLM backbone toward divergent, task-specific directions beyond the capacity of existing merging methods to unify. (2) Action experts develop inter-block dependencies through self-attention feedback, causing task information to spread across layers and preventing modular recombination. To address these challenges, we present MergeVLA, a merging-oriented VLA architecture that preserves mergeability by design. MergeVLA introduces sparsely activated LoRA adapters via task masks to retain consistent parameters and reduce irreconcilable conflicts in the VLM. Its action expert replaces self-attention with cross-attention-only blocks to keep specialization localized and composable. When the task is unknown, it uses a test-time task router to adaptively select the appropriate task mask and expert head from the initial observation, enabling unsupervised task inference. Across LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, RoboTwin, and multi-task experiments on the real SO101 robotic arm, MergeVLA achieves performance comparable to or even exceeding individually finetuned experts, demonstrating robust generalization across tasks, embodiments, and environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in legged robot navigation in GPS-denied and visually degraded environments where visual odometry fails.

Method: Proposes a two-stage paradigm with simulation data learning in Stage 1 and autoregressive enhancement via real-world data in Stage 2.

Result: AutoOdom outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the Booster T1 robot by improving trajectory and pose errors by 36.2%-59.2%.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively bridges the simulation-to-reality gap, improving resilience to noise and robustness in dynamic conditions.

Abstract: Accurate proprioceptive odometry is fundamental for legged robot navigation in GPS-denied and visually degraded environments where conventional visual odometry systems fail. Current approaches face critical limitations: analytical filtering methods suffer from modeling uncertainties and cumulative drift, hybrid learning-filtering approaches remain constrained by their analytical components, while pure learning-based methods struggle with simulation-to-reality transfer and demand extensive real-world data collection. This paper introduces AutoOdom, a novel autoregressive proprioceptive odometry system that overcomes these challenges through an innovative two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 employs large-scale simulation data to learn complex nonlinear dynamics and rapidly changing contact states inherent in legged locomotion, while Stage 2 introduces an autoregressive enhancement mechanism using limited real-world data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. The key innovation lies in our autoregressive training approach, where the model learns from its own predictions to develop resilience against sensor noise and improve robustness in highly dynamic environments. Comprehensive experimental validation on the Booster T1 humanoid robot demonstrates that AutoOdom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation metrics, achieving 57.2% improvement in absolute trajectory error, 59.2% improvement in Umeyama-aligned error, and 36.2% improvement in relative pose error compared to the Legolas baseline. Extensive ablation studies provide critical insights into sensor modality selection and temporal modeling, revealing counterintuitive findings about IMU acceleration data and validating our systematic design choices for robust proprioceptive odometry in challenging locomotion scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper explores how neural feedback from EEG signals can accelerate reinforcement learning (RL) in robotic manipulation tasks, showing success in obstacle-rich environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if neural evaluative signals, specifically EEG, can enhance policy learning for complex high-dimensional robotic manipulation tasks, overcoming challenges seen in sparse-reward RL settings.

Method: The authors integrate error-related potentials decoded from EEG classifiers into reward shaping and evaluate their impact on a 7-DoF manipulator's RL performance in reaching tasks with obstacles.

Result: Experiments show that neural feedback accelerates RL and improves task success rates, even outperforming sparse-reward baselines under optimal human-feedback weighting.

Conclusion: Neural feedback using EEG signals is effective in improving RL for robotic manipulation, demonstrating robustness across subjects and scalability beyond locomotion tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how implicit neural feed back can accelerate reinforcement learning in complex robotic manipulation settings. While prior electroencephalogram (EEG) guided reinforcement learning studies have primarily focused on navigation or low-dimensional locomotion tasks, we aim to understand whether such neural evaluative signals can improve policy learning in high-dimensional manipulation tasks involving obstacles and precise end-effector control. We integrate error related potentials decoded from offline-trained EEG classifiers into reward shaping and systematically evaluate the impact of human-feedback weighting. Experiments on a 7-DoF manipulator in an obstacle-rich reaching environment show that neural feedback accelerates reinforcement learning and, depending on the human-feedback weighting, can yield task success rates that at times exceed those of sparse-reward baselines. Moreover, when applying the best-performing feedback weighting across all sub jects, we observe consistent acceleration of reinforcement learning relative to the sparse-reward setting. Furthermore, leave-one subject-out evaluations confirm that the proposed framework remains robust despite the intrinsic inter-individual variability in EEG decodability. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based reinforcement learning can scale beyond locomotion tasks and provide a viable pathway for human-aligned manipulation skill acquisition.

*Samuel Cerezo,Seong Hun Lee,Javier Civera*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a closed-form initialization method that avoids nonlinear optimization and achieves reliable, efficient visual-inertial state recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies, complexity, and computational overhead of iterative solvers for visual-inertial initialization.

Method: A closed-form initialization method based on small-rotation and constant-velocity approximations, coupled with an observability-driven, two-stage scheme.

Result: Experimental validation shows 10-20% lower initialization error, 4x shorter initialization windows, and 5x lower computational cost compared to optimization-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method is robust, efficient, and offers significant performance improvements over traditional optimization-based approaches in visual-inertial initialization.

Abstract: In this letter, we present a closed-form initialization method that recovers the full visual-inertial state without nonlinear optimization. Unlike previous approaches that rely on iterative solvers, our formulation yields analytical, easy-to-implement, and numerically stable solutions for reliable start-up. Our method builds on small-rotation and constant-velocity approximations, which keep the formulation compact while preserving the essential coupling between motion and inertial measurements. We further propose an observability-driven, two-stage initialization scheme that balances accuracy with initialization latency. Extensive experiments on the EuRoC dataset validate our assumptions: our method achieves 10-20% lower initialization error than optimization-based approaches, while using 4x shorter initialization windows and reducing computational cost by 5x.

*Juntao Gao,Feiyang Ye,Jing Zhang,Wenjing Qian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Compressor-VLA improves efficiency in Embodied AI models by reducing visual token processing while maintaining task-critical information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time robotic deployment is hindered by computational overhead caused by redundant visual token processing, which existing methods cannot adequately address when preserving critical task-relevant data.

Method: Compressor-VLA introduces hybrid token compression modules: Semantic Task Compressor for holistic context and Spatial Refinement Compressor for fine-grained spatial details, modulated by natural language instructions.

Result: Compressor-VLA reduces FLOPs by 59% and visual token count by 3x while achieving competitive results on the LIBERO benchmark, validated by tests on real robots.

Conclusion: The framework is effective in balancing efficiency and performance, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications in Embodied AI.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in Embodied AI. However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address traffic congestion, accidents, and carbon emissions caused by rising vehicle ownership, by providing a better vehicle platooning solution.

Method: An end-to-end method that uses a semantic mask for causal confusion in multi-frame data fusion and a dynamic sampling mechanism for trajectory tracking, applied via a camera-based system.

Result: The proposed system outperforms traditional methods in vehicle following across various scenarios, validated through real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The framework provides a cost-effective and versatile solution for autonomous vehicle platooning, applicable to general scenarios without relying on expensive sensors or lane markings.

Abstract: The increase in vehicle ownership has led to increased traffic congestion, more accidents, and higher carbon emissions. Vehicle platooning is a promising solution to address these issues by improving road capacity and reducing fuel consumption. However, existing platooning systems face challenges such as reliance on lane markings and expensive high-precision sensors, which limits their general applicability. To address these issues, we propose a vehicle following framework that expands its capability from restricted scenarios to general scenario applications using only a camera. This is achieved through our newly proposed end-to-end method, which improves overall driving performance. The method incorporates a semantic mask to address causal confusion in multi-frame data fusion. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic sampling mechanism to precisely track the trajectories of preceding vehicles. Extensive closed-loop validation in real-world vehicle experiments demonstrates the system's ability to follow vehicles in various scenarios, outperforming traditional multi-stage algorithms. This makes it a promising solution for cost-effective autonomous vehicle platooning. A complete real-world vehicle experiment is available at https://youtu.be/zL1bcVb9kqQ.

*Haihang Wu,Yuchen Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extension to MASt3R-SLAM, creating the first multi-agent monocular dense SLAM system that improves computational efficiency while maintaining mapping accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular SLAM systems are computationally heavy due to iterative optimization, and MASt3R-SLAM is limited to a single agent, necessitating a scalable multi-agent solution.

Method: The presented method extends MASt3R-SLAM by employing 3D reconstruction priors for local mapping per agent and incorporates a loop-closure-based map fusion mechanism to create a globally consistent map.

Result: The proposed system achieves better computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods and preserves mapping accuracy, as proven by evaluations on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The multi-agent SLAM system successfully addresses the computational challenges of monocular SLAM, demonstrating feasibility and performance comparable to or better than existing techniques.

Abstract: Monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) aims to estimate a robot's pose while simultaneously reconstructing an unknown 3D scene using a single camera. While existing monocular SLAM systems generate detailed 3D geometry through dense scene representations, they are computationally expensive due to the need for iterative optimization. To address this challenge, MASt3R-SLAM utilizes learned 3D reconstruction priors, enabling more efficient and accurate estimation of both 3D structures and camera poses. However, MASt3R-SLAM is limited to single-agent operation. In this paper, we extend MASt3R-SLAM to introduce the first multi-agent monocular dense SLAM system. Each agent performs local SLAM using a 3D reconstruction prior, and their individual maps are fused into a globally consistent map through a loop-closure-based map fusion mechanism. Our approach improves computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining similar mapping accuracy when evaluated on real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety implementations for collaborative robots often reduce task efficiency due to overly restrictive speed limitations.

Method: The paper presents a human-robot-safety framework utilizing deep learning approaches like body recognition, segmentation, pose estimation, and body part segmentation for dynamic robot speed adjustments.

Result: Experiments show a reduction in cycle time of up to 15% with the new framework compared to traditional safety systems.

Conclusion: The framework optimizes robot processes by accurately identifying human body parts, balancing safety compliance with enhanced efficiency.

Abstract: Over the last years collaborative robots have gained great success in manufacturing applications where human and robot work together in close proximity. However, current ISO/TS-15066-compliant implementations often limit the efficiency of collaborative tasks due to conservative speed restrictions. For this reason, this paper introduces a deep-learning-based human-robot-safety framework (HRSF) that aims at a dynamical adaptation of robot velocities depending on the separation distance between human and robot while respecting maximum biomechanical force and pressure limits. The applicability of the framework was investigated for four different deep learning approaches that can be used for human body extraction: human body recognition, human body segmentation, human pose estimation, and human body part segmentation. Unlike conventional industrial safety systems, the proposed HRSF differentiates individual human body parts from other objects, enabling optimized robot process execution. Experiments demonstrated a quantitative reduction in cycle time of up to 15% compared to conventional safety technology.

TL;DR: This paper addresses autonomous UAV docking on blimps for extended flight missions by predicting wind responses and generating collision-free trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flight time limitations of UAVs due to battery capacity and the need for mid-flight recharging and data offloading.

Method: Temporal convolutional network for predicting blimp responses to wind gusts and a model predictive controller for collision-free docking trajectories.

Result: Improved docking performance compared to baseline models in simulations and successful validation in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively tackles challenges of docking UAVs on blimps, providing reliable advances for extended UAV missions outside simulation.

Abstract: Multi-rotor UAVs face limited flight time due to battery constraints. Autonomous docking on blimps with onboard battery recharging and data offloading offers a promising solution for extended UAV missions. However, the vulnerability of blimps to wind gusts causes trajectory deviations, requiring precise, obstacle-aware docking strategies. To this end, this work introduces two key novelties: (i) a temporal convolutional network that predicts blimp responses to wind gusts, enabling rapid gust detection and estimation of points where the wind gust effect has subsided; (ii) a model predictive controller (MPC) that leverages these predictions to compute collision-free trajectories for docking, enabled by a novel obstacle avoidance method for close-range manoeuvres near the blimp. Simulation results show our method outperforms a baseline constant-velocity model of the blimp significantly across different scenarios. We further validate the approach in real-world experiments, demonstrating the first autonomous multi-rotor docking control strategy on blimps shown outside simulation.

*Ann-Sophia Müller,Moonkwang Jeong,Jiyuan Tian,Meng Zhang,Tian Qiu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents an innovative stable 2D magnetic force trap using permanent magnets for millirobot manipulation in biomedical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current challenges in biomedical millirobots include achieving high actuation forces across large distances for minimally invasive surgeries.

Method: The authors propose a novel GPU-accelerated optimization algorithm using MSE and Adam optimizer to design a permanent magnet array for stable 2D force trapping.

Result: The experiment successfully demonstrated millirobot control along complex trajectories and scalable optimization of arrays with up to 100 magnets.

Conclusion: This approach offers promising advancements in magnetic manipulation for biomedical tools with scalable and efficient optimization for desired force fields.

Abstract: Untethered magnetic manipulation of biomedical millirobots has a high potential for minimally invasive surgical applications. However, it is still challenging to exert high actuation forces on the small robots over a large distance. Permanent magnets offer stronger magnetic torques and forces than electromagnetic coils, however, feedback control is more difficult. As proven by Earnshaw's theorem, it is not possible to achieve a stable magnetic trap in 3D by static permanent magnets. Here, we report a stable 2D magnetic force trap by an array of permanent magnets to control a millirobot. The trap is located in an open space with a tunable distance to the magnet array in the range of 20 - 120mm, which is relevant to human anatomical scales. The design is achieved by a novel GPU-accelerated optimization algorithm that uses mean squared error (MSE) and Adam optimizer to efficiently compute the optimal angles for any number of magnets in the array. The algorithm is verified using numerical simulation and physical experiments with an array of two magnets. A millirobot is successfully trapped and controlled to follow a complex trajectory. The algorithm demonstrates high scalability by optimizing the angles for 100 magnets in under three seconds. Moreover, the optimization workflow can be adapted to optimize a permanent magnet array to achieve the desired force vector fields.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) framework that enables quadrupedal and humanoid robots to exhibit emergent locomotion behaviors and complex motions without predefined gait patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate reliance on handcrafted gait patterns or predefined contact sequences in robotic locomotion and enable emergent motion purely driven by high-level objectives.

Method: The method employs model predictive path integral (MPPI) with a dual-space spline parameterization for trajectory sampling, operating on position and velocity control points, allowing contact-adaptive strategies with reduced sample needs.

Result: The framework enabled diverse real-time locomotion patterns like trotting, jumping, handstands, and dynamic balancing on quadrupedal and humanoid robots, validated both experimentally and in simulation.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates efficient real-time control allowing emergent gaits and complex locomotion behaviors on standard hardware, removing the need for GPU acceleration and offline training.

Abstract: We present a sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) framework that enables emergent locomotion without relying on handcrafted gait patterns or predefined contact sequences. Our method discovers diverse motion patterns, ranging from trotting to galloping, robust standing policies, jumping, and handstand balancing, purely through the optimization of high-level objectives. Building on model predictive path integral (MPPI), we propose a dual-space spline parameterization that operates on position and velocity control points. Our approach enables contact-making and contact-breaking strategies that adapt automatically to task requirements, requiring only a limited number of sampled trajectories. This sample efficiency allows us to achieve real-time control on standard CPU hardware, eliminating the need for GPU acceleration typically required by other state-of-the-art MPPI methods. We validate our approach on the Go2 quadrupedal robot, demonstrating various emergent gaits and basic jumping capabilities. In simulation, we further showcase more complex behaviors, such as backflips, dynamic handstand balancing and locomotion on a Humanoid, all without requiring reference tracking or offline pre-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to improve the performance of soft pneumatic grippers by optimizing their design through advanced modeling techniques that account for actuation-specific factors.

Method: The paper uses a topology optimization approach based on Darcy's law with a drainage term. A robust optimization method is applied with constraints on strain-energy and volume, with MMA to solve the optimization problem.

Result: The optimized 2D unit outperforms a conventional rectangular design. It was scaled to a 3D module, and 3D-printed arms showcased improved gripping performance tested on objects of varying properties.

Conclusion: The proposed design and optimization framework lead to significant performance improvements in soft pneumatic grippers, demonstrating versatility across different object types.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic topology optimization framework for designing a soft pneumatic gripper (SPG), explicitly considering the design-dependent nature of the actuating load. The load is modeled using Darcy's law with an added drainage term. A 2D soft arm unit is optimized by formulating it as a compliant mechanism design problem using the robust formulation. The problem is posed as a min-max optimization, where the output deformations of blueprint and eroded designs are considered. A volume constraint is imposed on the blueprint part, while a strain-energy constraint is enforced on the eroded part. The MMA is employed to solve the optimization problem and obtain the optimized soft unit. Finite element analysis with the Ogden material model confirms that the optimized 2D unit outperforms a conventional rectangular design under pneumatic loading. The optimized 2D unit is extruded to obtain a 3D module, and ten such units are assembled to create a soft arm. Deformation profiles of the optimized arm are analysed under different pressure loads. Four arms are 3D-printed and integrated with a supporting structure to realize the proposed SPG. The gripping performance of the SPG is demonstrated on objects with different weights, sizes, stiffness, and shapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in humanoid control systems where teleoperation is human-driven, and modular systems lack a tight connection between language commands and physical actions.

Method: A novel model, SENTINEL, is developed by constructing a dataset pairing human motion simulations with text annotations, enabling direct mapping of language commands to low-level actions using flow matching and a refinement process.

Result: SENTINEL demonstrates strong semantic understanding and stable execution of tasks on humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world scenarios, along with multi-modal functionalities.

Conclusion: The proposed model sets a new benchmark in humanoid robotics by linking language inputs directly to physical actions, proving its adaptability and efficacy in practical deployment.

Abstract: Existing humanoid control systems often rely on teleoperation or modular generation pipelines that separate language understanding from physical execution. However, the former is entirely human-driven, and the latter lacks tight alignment between language commands and physical behaviors. In this paper, we present SENTINEL, a fully end-to-end language-action model for humanoid whole-body control. We construct a large-scale dataset by tracking human motions in simulation using a pretrained whole body controller, combined with their text annotations. The model directly maps language commands and proprioceptive inputs to low-level actions without any intermediate representation. The model generates action chunks using flow matching, which can be subsequently refined by a residual action head for real-world deployment. Our method exhibits strong semantic understanding and stable execution on humanoid robots in both simulation and real-world deployment, and also supports multi-modal extensions by converting inputs into texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the tradeoff between vision-language model comprehension and generalization when translating human instructions into action-executable representations for robot manipulation.

Method: The method involves designing SEAM, a semantic assembly representation based on context-free grammar principles, and implementing a new open-vocabulary segmentation paradigm with retrieval-augmented few-shot learning for localization of object parts.

Result: SEAM achieves superior performance in action-generalizability and VLM-comprehensibility, supported by novel metrics and SOTA results in real-world settings with efficient inference time.

Conclusion: SEAM is an effective and efficient representation for improving robot manipulation by balancing comprehensibility and generalizability, outperforming contemporary approaches.

Abstract: Vision-Language Model (VLM) is an important component to enable robust robot manipulation. Yet, using it to translate human instructions into an action-resolvable intermediate representation often needs a tradeoff between VLM-comprehensibility and generalizability. Inspired by context-free grammar, we design the Semantic Assembly representation named SEAM, by decomposing the intermediate representation into vocabulary and grammar. Doing so leads us to a concise vocabulary of semantically-rich operations and a VLM-friendly grammar for handling diverse unseen tasks. In addition, we design a new open-vocabulary segmentation paradigm with a retrieval-augmented few-shot learning strategy to localize fine-grained object parts for manipulation, effectively with the shortest inference time over all state-of-the-art parallel works. Also, we formulate new metrics for action-generalizability and VLM-comprehensibility, demonstrating the compelling performance of SEAM over mainstream representations on both aspects. Extensive real-world experiments further manifest its SOTA performance under varying settings and tasks.

Conclusion: The mechanism is effective for space missions, showing promising results in combining mechanical optimization and AI for accurate structural design.

Abstract: Given the increasing need for large aperture antennas in space missions, the difficulty of fitting such structures into small launch vehicles has prompted the design of deployable antenna systems. The thesis introduces a new Triple Scissors Deployable Truss Mechanism (TSDTM) for space antenna missions. The new mechanism is to be stowed during launch and efficiently deploy in orbit, offering maximum aperture size while taking up minimal launch volume. The thesis covers the entire design process from geometric modeling, kinematic analysis with screw theory and Newtonian approaches, dynamic analysis by eigenvalue and simulation methods, and verification with SolidWorks. In addition, optimization routines were coded based on Support Vector Machines for material choice in LEO environments and machine learning method for geometric setup. The TSDTM presented has enhanced structural dynamics with good comparison between simulation and analytical predictions. The structure optimized proved highly accurate, with a deviation of just 1.94% between machine learning-predicted and simulated natural frequencies, demonstrating the potential of incorporating AI-based methods in space structural design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inherent trade-off in action chunk length, which affects either global foresight or fine-grained accuracy in robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: The paper introduces Mixture of Horizons (MoH), which processes action chunks of varying horizons in parallel and fuses them via a shared action transformer and linear gating mechanism. This allows joint exploitation of both short-term and long-term capabilities.

Result: MoH significantly improves performance and generalizability in simulations and real-world environments, achieving superior performance with a 99% success rate on LIBERO under mixed-task setting in reduced training iterations.

Conclusion: MoH is an effective and efficient strategy for improving vision-language-action models by balancing trade-offs, enhancing performance, and enabling adaptive and dynamic inference for robotic tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation, but their performance is sensitive to the $\textbf{action chunk length}$ used during training, termed $\textbf{horizon}$. Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $π_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the evolving nature of requirements quality in software engineering, particularly with the shift towards AI consumers, by proposing Agentic AI simulations for research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quality in Requirements Engineering is still based on intuition and lacks empirical data, especially with the emergence of AI-driven development, necessitating new evaluation methods for efficient and effective requirements styles.

Method: The authors propose using Agentic AI simulations, which replicate software engineering processes in simulations with standardized agents to examine the quality of requirements in a dynamic and cost-effective manner.

Result: The paper presents a concept, roadmap, prototype, and feasibility study for RE simulations. Results show that even a basic implementation yields executable simulations, encouraging further refinement and application.

Conclusion: Agentic AI simulations are a promising addition to assessing requirements quality in RE, offering new avenues for research despite challenges replicating human behavior, with further refinement anticipated.

Abstract: Context and motivation. Quality in Requirements Engineering (RE) is still predominantly anecdotal and intuition-driven. Creating a solid requirements quality model requires broad sets of empirical evidence to evaluate quality factors and their context. Problem. However, empirical data on the detailed effects of requirements quality defects is scarce, since it is costly to obtain. Furthermore, with the advent of AI-based development, the requirements quality factors may change: Requirements are no longer only consumed by humans, but increasingly also by AI agents, which might lead to a different efficient and effective requirements style. Principal ideas. We propose to extend the RE research toolbox with Agentic AI simulations, in which software engineering (SE) processes are replicated by standardized agents in stochastic, dynamic, event-driven, qualitative simulations. We argue that their speed and simplicity makes them a valuable addition to RE research, although limitations in replicating human behavior need to be studied and understood. Contribution. This paper contributes a first concept, a research roadmap, a prototype, and a first feasibility study for RE simulations with agentic AI. Study results indicate that even a naive implementation leads to executable simulations, encouraging technical improvements along with broader application in RE research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A configurable rule engine was developed to validate API design quality, using 75 rules to automatically detect structural violations in OpenAPI specifications, contributing to consistency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in evaluating API design quality, which is currently a mostly manual process, particularly during early development stages, ensuring interoperability, evolution, and governance.

Method: Using Design Science Research methodology, the study identified 75 API design rules from literature, implemented a configurable rule engine, and evaluated it via experiments and industry expert analysis.

Result: The tool validated non-functional API requirements, provided actionable feedback, automated checks, and aligned with enterprise architecture processes, enhancing API design and interoperability.

Conclusion: The tool operationalizes API design principles into verifiable constraints, embedding them into validation processes, thus improving consistency and continuous compliance in API development.

Abstract: RESTful APIs are central in developing interoperable, modular, and maintainable software systems in enterprises today. Also, it is essential to support system evolution, service interoperability, and governance across organizational boundaries to ensure good quality and consistency of these APIs. However, evaluating API design quality, which is part of non-functional requirement tasks, remains a largely manual and ad hoc process, particularly during early development. Using a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, we elicited user needs, identified 75 API design rules using a literature review, and implemented a configurable rule engine to detect structural violations in OpenAPI specifications. The proposed tool supports organizational adaptability by allowing rules to be customized, enabled, or disabled, enabling integration of domain-specific standards. The evaluation was conducted through structured experiments and thematic analysis involving industry experts. API quality validation contributes to aligning technical designs with requirements and enterprise architecture by strengthening interoperability and governance between enterprise systems. The results show that S.E.O.R.A facilitates early validation of non-functional API requirements, provides actionable and traceable feedback, and aligns well with requirements elicitation and quality assurance processes. It improves the API design process by automating checks that would otherwise require manual inspection, thus supporting consistent and reusable conformance practices. This work contributes to requirements engineering by operationalizing design principles as verifiable constraints and embedding them into a practical validation tool. Future directions include IDE integration, expanded rule coverage, and real-world deployment to support continuous compliance in agile API development lifecycles.

Conclusion: SLMFix demonstrates its potential as an effective, computationally efficient alternative to traditional finetuning methods, improving program quality and generalizability across diverse programming languages.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown very impressive capabilities in code generation across many programming languages. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs generate programs that contains syntactic errors and fail to complete the given tasks, especially for low-resource programming languages (LRPLs). In addition, high training cost makes finetuning LLMs unaffordable with constrained computational resources, further undermining the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation. In this work, we propose SLMFix, a novel code generation pipeline that leverages a small language model (SLM) finetuned using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to fix syntactic errors in LLM-generated programs to improve the quality of LLM-generated programs for domain-specific languages (DSLs). In specific, we applied RL on the SLM for the program repair task using a reward calculated using both a static validator and a static semantic similarity metric. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across multiple DSLs, achieving more than 95% pass rate on the static validator. Notably, SLMFix brings substantial improvement to the base model and outperforms supervised finetuning approach even for 7B models on a LRPL, showing the potential of our approach as an alternative to traditional finetuning approaches.

### [770] [Synthesizing Precise Protocol Specs from Natural Language for Effective Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17977)
*Kuangxiangzi Liu,Dhiman Chakraborty,Alexander Liggesmeyer,Andreas Zeller*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents AUTOSPEC, a two-stage pipeline which uses large language models to bridge the gap between natural language specifications and formal specifications, enabling scalable automated testing of critical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual derivation of test cases from natural language specifications is slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale. Formal specifications support automated test generation but are challenging to create and maintain.

Method: The method involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) extracting protocol elements from natural language specifications using LLMs; (2) synthesizing formal specifications from these elements for automated test generation through the use of protocol implementations.

Result: The AUTOSPEC prototype demonstrated feasibility and showed significant success in generating formal specifications for five internet protocols, recovering a high percentage of message types and achieving considerable message acceptance in real systems.

Conclusion: The approach appears superior to end-to-end LLM-based test generation due to enhanced traceability, human-readability, and potential for iterative refinement and building datasets for further LLM training in natural-to-formal specification mapping.

Abstract: Safety- and security-critical systems have to be thoroughly tested against their specifications. The state of practice is to have _natural language_ specifications, from which test cases are derived manually - a process that is slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale. _Formal_ specifications, on the other hand, are well-suited for automated test generation, but are tedious to write and maintain. In this work, we propose a two-stage pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap: First, we extract _protocol elements_ from natural-language specifications; second, leveraging a protocol implementation, we synthesize and refine a formal _protocol specification_ from these elements, which we can then use to massively test further implementations.
  We see this two-stage approach to be superior to end-to-end LLM-based test generation, as 1. it produces an _inspectable specification_ that preserves traceability to the original text; 2. the generation of actual test cases _no longer requires an LLM_; 3. the resulting formal specs are _human-readable_, and can be reviewed, version-controlled, and incrementally refined; and 4. over time, we can build a _corpus_ of natural-language-to-formal-specification mappings that can be used to further train and refine LLMs for more automatic translations.
  Our prototype, AUTOSPEC, successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our approach on five widely used _internet protocols_ (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP, and ManageSieve) by applying its methods on their _RFC specifications_ written in natural-language, and the recent _I/O grammar_ formalism for protocol specification and fuzzing. In its evaluation, AUTOSPEC recovers on average 92.8% of client and 80.2% of server message types, and achieves 81.5% message acceptance across diverse, real-world systems.

*Jiaolong Kong,Xiaofei Xie,Yiheng Xiong,Yuekun Wang,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TokenRepair introduces an advanced two-level refinement framework for automated program repair that improves performance by integrating internal token-level evaluations with external patch-quality feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for automated program repair rely on coarse-grained feedback and lack fine-grained error localization, leading to inefficiency and poor refinement results.

Method: TokenRepair uses token-level uncertainty analysis for identifying faulty code tokens, applies Chain-of-Thought guided rewriting for targeted correction, and incorporates external feedback to filter low-quality patches.

Result: TokenRepair achieves state-of-the-art results, fixing 88 bugs on Defects4J 1.2 and 139 bugs on HumanEval-Java, with improvements ranging from 8.2% to 34.9% on Defects4J 1.2 and 3.3% to 16.1% on HumanEval-Java.

Conclusion: The integration of internal token analysis and external feedback makes TokenRepair an effective and fine-grained approach for automated program repair, achieving notable performance gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential for automated program repair (APR). However, existing LLM-based techniques primarily rely on coarse-grained external feedback (e.g.,test results) to guide iterative patch generation, while lacking fine-grained internal signals that reveal why a patch fails or which parts of the generated code are likely incorrect. This limitation often leads to inefficient refinement, error propagation, and suboptimal repair performance. In this work, we propose TokenRepair, a novel two-level refinement framework that enhances APR by integrating internal reflection for localizing potentially faulty tokens with external feedback for quality-aware patch refinement. Specifically, TokenRepair first performs internal reflection by analyzing context-aware token-level uncertainty fluctuations to identify suspicious or low-confidence tokens within a patch. It then applies Chain-of-Thought guided rewriting to refine only these localized tokens, enabling targeted and fine-grained correction. To further stabilize the iterative repair loop, TokenRepair incorporates a quality-aware external feedback mechanism that evaluates patch quality and filters out low-quality candidates before refinement. Experimental results show that TokenRepair achieves new state-of-the-art repair performance, correctly fixing 88 bugs on Defects4J 1.2 and 139 bugs on HumanEval-Java, demonstrating substantial improvements ranging from 8.2% to 34.9% across all models on Defects4J 1.2 and from 3.3% to 16.1% on HumanEval-Java.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces MASTEST, a multi-agent system leveraging large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and DeepSeek to automate API testing. It covers the full workflow, from generating scenarios to executing tests and analyzing responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the increasing importance of automated API testing for cloud-native applications, leveraging advancements in LLMs to improve the quality and efficiency of testing processes.

Method: MASTEST combines LLM-based agents and programmed agents to generate and execute test scenarios and scripts, analyze responses, and ensure test coverage. It incorporates human oversight to refine test artifacts.

Result: Evaluation with five public APIs shows high performance for LLMs in API operation coverage and bug detection. DeepSeek leads in data type and status code correctness, while GPT-4o excels in API operation coverage.

Conclusion: MASTEST demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using LLMs for automated API testing, requiring minimal manual intervention for semantic correctness and achieving strong performance across various metrics.

Abstract: Testing RESTful API is increasingly important in quality assurance of cloud-native applications. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated that various testing activities can be performed automatically by large language models (LLMs) with reasonable accuracy. This paper develops a multi-agent system called MASTEST that combines LLM-based and programmed agents to form a complete tool chain that covers the whole workflow of API test starting from generating unit and system test scenarios from API specification in the OpenAPI Swagger format, to generating of Pytest test scripts, executing test scripts to interact with web services, to analysing web service response messages to determine test correctness and calculate test coverage. The system also supports the incorporation of human testers in reviewing and correcting LLM generated test artefacts to ensure the quality of testing activities. MASTEST system is evaluated on two LLMs, GPT-4o and DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner with five public APIs. The performances of LLMs on various testing activities are measured by a wide range of metrics, including unit and system test scenario coverage and API operation coverage for the quality of generated test scenarios, data type correctness, status code coverage and script syntax correctness for the quality of LLM generated test scripts, as well as bug detection ability and usability of LLM generated test scenarios and scripts. Experiment results demonstrated that both DeepSeek and GPT-4o achieved a high overall performance. DeepSeek excels in data type correctness and status code detection, while GPT-4o performs best in API operation coverage. For both models, LLM generated test scripts maintained 100\% syntax correctness and only required minimal manual edits for semantic correctness. These findings indicate the effectiveness and feasibility of MASTEST.

*Sebastian Dingler,Philip Rehkop,Florian Mayer,Ralf Muenzenberger*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper develops a White-Box methodology using Event-Chain Modeling to address timing constraints in Automated Driving Systems, leveraging a detailed case study to demonstrate compliance and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address stringent timing constraints imposed by international regulations on Automated Driving Systems for safety and compliance.

Method: A structured White-Box methodology based on Event-Chain Modeling is employed, enabling clear modelling, validation, and simulation of timing constraints in ADS systems.

Result: The case study shows enhanced regulatory compliance, optimization of system design, early detection of compliance issues, and probabilistic analysis for evidence generation.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology improves transparency, compliance, and design efficiency in ADS timing analysis, offering a systematic approach for early verification and optimization.

Abstract: Automated Driving Systems (ADS), including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), must fulfill not only high functional expectations but also stringent timing constraints mandated by international regulations and standards. Regulatory frameworks such as UN regulations, NCAP standards, ISO norms, and NHTSA guidelines impose strict bounds on system reaction times to ensure safe vehicle operation. This paper presents a structured, White-Box methodology based on Event-Chain Modeling to address these timing challenges. Unlike Black-Box approaches, Event-Chain Analysis offers transparent insights into the timing behavior of each functional component - from perception and planning to actuation and human interaction. This perspective is also aligned with multiple regulations, which require that homologation dossiers provide evidence that the chosen system architecture is suitable to ensure compliance with the specified requirements. Our methodology enables the derivation, modeling, and validation of end-to-end timing constraints at the architectural level and facilitates early verification through simulation. Through a detailed case study, we demonstrate how this Event-Chain-centric approach enhances regulatory compliance, optimizes system design, and supports model-based safety analysis techniques, with results showing early identification of compliance issues, systematic parameter optimization, and quantitative evidence generation through probabilistic analysis.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Hierarchical Planning (HP), introducing L2HP for generating HP models and comparing LLM performance on Automated Planning (AP) and HP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in the application of LLMs in generating Hierarchical Planning (HP) models, a field less advanced than non-hierarchical planning systems.

Method: The researchers developed L2HP, an extension of L2P, which supports HP model generation. Experiments were conducted comparing LLMs’ capabilities for AP and HP using the PlanBench dataset.

Result: The parsing success rate for both AP and HP models was around 36%, but the syntactic validity was much lower for HP models (1%) compared to AP models (20%), revealing distinct challenges in hierarchical settings.

Conclusion: Hierarchical Planning presents unique challenges for Large Language Models, necessitating further research to enhance the accuracy and quality of generated models in this domain.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Automated Planning (AP) models has been widely explored; however, their application to Hierarchical Planning (HP) is still far from reaching the level of sophistication observed in non-hierarchical architectures. In this work, we try to address this gap. We present two main contributions. First, we propose L2HP, an extension of L2P (a library to LLM-driven PDDL models generation) that support HP model generation and follows a design philosophy of generality and extensibility. Second, we apply our framework to perform experiments where we compare the modeling capabilities of LLMs for AP and HP. On the PlanBench dataset, results show that parsing success is limited but comparable in both settings (around 36\%), while syntactic validity is substantially lower in the hierarchical case (1\% vs. 20\% of instances). These findings underscore the unique challenges HP presents for LLMs, highlighting the need for further research to improve the quality of generated HP models.

*Sristy Sumana Nath,Banani Roy,Munima Jahan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of traceability links in software release notes in open-source development, proposing a dataset and using large language models (LLMs) for automatic link recovery with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current challenges include frequent absence or errors in traceability links in software release notes, hindering the management of technical debt and maintainability in open-source development.

Method: The paper analyzed release notes for key information, curated a benchmark dataset of traceability instances, and implemented LLM-based approaches (like Gemini 1.5 Pro) combining time proximity for establishing traceability links automatically.

Result: The LLM-based approach achieved a high Precision@1 value of 0.73 in recovering traceability links, showing its effectiveness in aligning release notes with PRs, commits, and issues.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves traceability in software development artifacts and shows potential for adoption, as validated through an online survey, underlining its importance and partial industry readiness.

Abstract: Maintaining traceability links between software release notes and corresponding development artifacts, e.g., pull requests (PRs), commits, and issues, is essential for managing technical debt and ensuring maintainability. However, in open-source environments where contributors work remotely and asynchronously, establishing and maintaining these links is often error-prone, time-consuming, and frequently overlooked. Our empirical study of GitHub repositories revealed that 47% of release artifacts lacked traceability links, and 12% contained broken links. To address this gap, we first analyzed release notes to identify their What, Why, and How information and assessed how these align with PRs, commits, and issues. We curated a benchmark dataset consisting of 3,500 filtered and validated traceability link instances. Then, we implemented LLM-based approaches to automatically establish traceability links of three pairs between release note contents & PRs, release note contents & PRs and release note contents & issues. By combining the time proximity feature, the LLM-based approach, e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, achieved a high Precision@1 value of 0.73 for PR traceability recovery. To evaluate the usability and adoption potential of this approach, we conducted an online survey involving 33 open-source practitioners. 16% of respondents rated as very important, and 68% as somewhat important for traceability maintenance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CodeMetaAgent (CMA), which uses Metamorphic Relations (MRs) to refine task specifications and improve the consistency of test case generation in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of ambiguity and inconsistency in LLM-generated software engineering outputs caused by improper user specifications.

Method: The authors proposed CodeMetaAgent (CMA), a framework that incorporates Metamorphic Relations (MRs) to systematically refine task inputs and generate semantically constrained test cases with LLMs, contrasting it with traditional uses of MRs.

Result: CMA improved code generation accuracy by up to 17% and code coverage by up to 99.81% across datasets such as HumanEval-Pro, MBPP-Pro, and SWE-Bench_Lite while using LLMs like GPT-4o, Mistral Large, GPT-OSS, and Qwen3-Coder.

Conclusion: Metamorphic Relations serve as an effective tool to guide LLMs in improving software development processes, leading to significant gains in accuracy and coverage.

Abstract: Metamorphic Relations (MRs) serve as a foundational mechanism for generating semantically equivalent mutations. Software engineering has advanced significantly in recent years with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reliability of LLMs in software engineering is often compromised by ambiguities and inconsistencies due to improper user specification. To address this challenge, we present CodeMetaAgent (CMA), a metamorphic relation-driven LLM agent that systematically refines task specifications and generates semantically constrained test cases. Our proposed framework uses MRs with LLMs to improve generation consistency and reduce variability caused by specifications, unlike the traditional use of MRs as post validations. Our framework has been evaluated on the HumanEval-Pro, MBPP-Pro, and SWE-Bench_Lite datasets using the GPT-4o, Mistral Large, GPT-OSS, and Qwen3-Coder models. It improved code generation accuracy by up to 17% and achieved code coverage gains of up to 99.81%. These results show that metamorphic relations can be a simple but effective guide in assisting LLM-based software development.

*Wenhan Wang,Kaibo Liu,Zeyu Sun,An Ran Chen,Ge Li,Gang Huang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to address path constraint solving issues in symbolic execution, showing their effectiveness in generating test cases and improving test coverage for real-world software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic execution faces limitations in solving complex execution path constraints, especially those involving data structures or external API calls. The researchers aim to investigate if LLMs can overcome these challenges to enhance symbolic execution.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs in two tasks—test input generation and path classification. Using newly built pipelines and benchmarks sourced from competition-level programs and real-world repositories, the effectiveness of LLMs is examined.

Result: Experiments reveal that LLMs achieve 60% accuracy in generating test cases for specified execution paths, and improve test coverage by handling paths traditional symbolic execution tools cannot.

Conclusion: LLMs hold promise for extending symbolic execution techniques, potentially overcoming existing limitations and broadening their applicability to diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Symbolic execution is an important software analysis technique which benefits downstream tasks such as software testing and debugging. However, several limitations hinder symbolic execution from application on real-world software. One of the limitations is the inability to solve diverse execution path constraints: traditional symbolic execution based on SMT solvers is difficult to handle execution paths with complex data structures or external API calls. In this paper, we focus on investigating the possibility of adopting large language models (LLM) for path constraint solving instead of traditional solver-based techniques in symbolic execution. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate the ability of LLMs in two types of path constraint solving: generating test inputs to facilitate an execution path, and determining whether a given execution path can be satisfied without triggering any bugs. We build new evaluation pipelines and benchmarks for two tasks: test case generation and path classification, which include data sources from both competition-level programs and real-world repositories. Our experiment results show that state-of-the-art LLMs are able to solve path constraints in both generation and classification tasks, with 60% of generated test cases that accurately cover the given execution path. Moreover, LLMs are capable of improving test coverage by covering execution paths in real-world repositories where traditional symbolic execution tools cannot be applied. These findings highlight the possibility of extending symbolic execution techniques with LLMs in the future to improve the ability and generalizability of symbolic execution.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving artifact recommendation in open source development by proposing TreeRec, a feature tree-guided framework that enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers face challenges in finding reusable artifacts due to the large number of available options and the limitations of traditional artifact recommendation methods.

Method: The paper introduces IntentRecBench, a benchmark for evaluating artifact recommendation. It compares LLMs and traditional methods, and proposes TreeRec, a framework that organizes artifacts into a semantic tree using LLM-based abstraction.

Result: Results demonstrate that LLMs outperform traditional methods but face precision and inference cost issues. Using TreeRec significantly boosts LLM performance across ecosystems.

Conclusion: TreeRec proves to be effective and generalizable for improving LLM-based artifact recommendation, with potential for practical application.

Abstract: In open source software development, the reuse of existing artifacts has been widely adopted to avoid redundant implementation work. Reusable artifacts are considered more efficient and reliable than developing software components from scratch. However, when faced with a large number of reusable artifacts, developers often struggle to find artifacts that can meet their expected needs. To reduce this burden, retrieval-based and learning-based techniques have been proposed to automate artifact recommendations. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to understand intentions, perform semantic alignment, and recommend usable artifacts. Nevertheless, their effectiveness has not been thoroughly explored. To fill this gap, we construct an intent-driven artifact recommendation benchmark named IntentRecBench, covering three representative open source ecosystems. Using IntentRecBench, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of five popular LLMs and six traditional approaches in terms of precision and efficiency. Our results show that although LLMs outperform traditional methods, they still suffer from low precision and high inference cost due to the large candidate space. Inspired by the ontology-based semantic organization in software engineering, we propose TreeRec, a feature tree-guided recommendation framework to mitigate these issues. TreeRec leverages LLM-based semantic abstraction to organize artifacts into a hierarchical semantic tree, enabling intent and function alignment and reducing reasoning time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TreeRec consistently improves the performance of diverse LLMs across ecosystems, highlighting its generalizability and potential for practical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model (LLM)-based systems are sensitive to minor input variations that may compromise their utility. This paper addresses the challenge in evaluating and improving the robustness of systems using COBOL code as input.

Method: The authors created a library of COBOL code perturbation techniques, expanded a benchmark dataset with input variations, assessed robustness via metric analysis of system outputs, and introduced visualization dashboards for debugging and understanding system sensitivity.

Result: The study provided tools for measuring and visualizing the sensitivity of LLM-based systems to COBOL input variations, with examples of debugging and improving system robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework aids in evaluating and enhancing the robustness of LLM-based systems for COBOL by identifying input variations and facilitating systemic improvements through intuitive visualization tools.

Abstract: Systems incorporating large language models (LLMs) as a component are known to be sensitive (i.e., non-robust) to minor input variations that do not change the meaning of the input; such sensitivity may reduce the system's usefulness. Here, we present a framework to evaluate robustness of systems using COBOL code as input; our application is translation between COBOL and Java programming languages, but the approach extends to other tasks such as code generation or explanation. Targeting robustness of systems with COBOL as input is essential yet challenging. Many business-critical applications are written in COBOL, yet these are typically proprietary legacy applications and their code is unavailable to LLMs for training. We develop a library of COBOL paragraph and full-program perturbation methods, and create variant-expanded versions of a benchmark dataset of examples for a specific task. The robustness of the LLM-based system is evaluated by measuring changes in values of individual and aggregate metrics calculated on the system's outputs. Finally, we present a series of dynamic table and chart visualization dashboards that assist in debugging the system's outputs, and monitoring and understanding root causes of the system's sensitivity to input variation. These tools can be further used to improve the system by, for instance, indicating variations that should be handled by pre-processing steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for assessing hybrid quantum programs as integrated workflows instead of isolating devices or algorithms.

Method: Formalized metrics like Quantum Readiness Level (QRL), Utility of Quantumness (UQ) speedup, timing-and-drift audits, and Python implementations for reproducibility.

Result: Defined metrics along with Python reference examples compatible with Qiskit or PennyLane, ensuring matched budgets and reproducibility.

Conclusion: The introduced metrics and implementations provide a practical framework to evaluate the utility and readiness of hybrid quantum programs within workflows.

Abstract: We study how to evaluate hybrid quantum programs as end-to-end workflows rather than as isolated devices or algorithms. Building on the Hybrid Quantum Program Evaluation Framework (HQPEF), we formalize a workflow-aware Quantum Readiness Level (QRL) score; define a normalized speedup under quality constraints for the Utility of Quantumness (UQ); and provide a timing-and-drift audit for hybrid pipelines. We complement these definitions with concise Python reference implementations that illustrate how to instantiate the metrics and audit procedures with state-of-the-art classical and quantum solvers (e.g., via Qiskit or PennyLane), while preserving matched-budget discipline and reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the dual problem of overlogging (costly and redundant) and underlogging (risk of missing critical information) and to overcome limitations in existing tools by addressing the entire logging pipeline.

Method: Autologger employs a classifier named Judger for whether-to-log decisions, followed by specialized multi-agents for where and what to log, integrating program analysis and retrieval tools.

Result: Autologger achieves 96.63% F1-score in deciding whether to log, improves logging quality by 16.13% compared to the best baseline, and provides a generalizable framework boosting different LLMs.

Conclusion: Autologger effectively addresses the composite nature of software logging, proving its accuracy and efficiency while offering a scalable solution suited for diverse applications.

Abstract: Software logging is critical for system observability, yet developers face a dual crisis of costly overlogging and risky underlogging. Existing automated logging tools often overlook the fundamental whether-to-log decision and struggle with the composite nature of logging. In this paper, we propose Autologger, a novel hybrid framework that addresses the complete the end-to-end logging pipeline. Autologger first employs a fine-tuned classifier, the Judger, to accurately determine if a method requires new logging statements. If logging is needed, a multi-agent system is activated. The system includes specialized agents: a Locator dedicated to determining where to log, and a Generator focused on what to log. These agents work together, utilizing our designed program analysis and retrieval tools. We evaluate Autologger on a large corpus from three mature open-source projects against state-of-the-art baselines. Our results show that Autologger achieves 96.63\% F1-score on the crucial whether-to-log decision. In an end-to-end setting, Autologger improves the overall quality of generated logging statements by 16.13\% over the strongest baseline, as measured by an LLM-as-a-judge score. We also demonstrate that our framework is generalizable, consistently boosting the performance of various backbone LLMs.

While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.

### [784] [From Reviewers' Lens: Understanding Bug Bounty Report Invalid Reasons with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18608)
*Jiangrui Zheng,Yingming Zhou,Ali Abdullah Ahmad,Hanqing Yao,Xueqing Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper conducts an empirical study to help bug hunters understand invalid bug reports, leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a taxonomy-based framework to enhance detection and reduce bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bug bounty platforms rely on crowdsourced vulnerability reports but struggle with identifying invalid reports, especially with an increase in AI-generated submissions.

Method: The authors analyzed 9,942 disclosed bug bounty reports, tested LLMs like GPT-5 and RoBERTa, built a taxonomy for rejection reasons, and improved prediction via a retrieval-augmented generation framework.

Result: Models generally struggled with detecting invalid reports, showing over-acceptance tendencies. The RAG framework improved classification consistency and mitigated bias. Additionally, reporter reputation influenced reviewer decisions.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with structured reviewer knowledge significantly boosts transparent invalid report identification and supports fairer bug bounty report review processes.

Abstract: Bug bounty platforms (e.g., HackerOne, BugCrowd) leverage crowd-sourced vulnerability discovery to improve continuous coverage, reduce the cost of discovery, and serve as an integral complement to internal red teams. With the rise of AI-generated bug reports, little work exists to help bug hunters understand why these reports are labeled as invalid. To improve report quality and reduce reviewers' burden, it is critical to predict invalid reports and interpret invalid reasons.
  In this work, we conduct an empirical study with the purpose of helping bug hunters understand the validity of reports. We collect a dataset of 9,942 disclosed bug bounty reports, including 1,400 invalid reports, and evaluate whether state-of-the-art large language models can identify invalid reports. While models such as GPT-5, DeepSeek, and a fine-tuned RoBERTa achieve strong overall accuracy, they consistently struggle to detect invalid cases, showing a tendency to over-accept reports. To improve invalidity detection, we build a taxonomy of rejection reasons for Information Disclosure vulnerabilities and incorporate it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. This approach substantially improves classification consistency and reduces bias. We also examine whether reviewer decisions may be influenced by factors beyond the content of the report. Our analysis shows that reporters with higher reputations tend to receive more favorable outcomes in borderline cases, suggesting that perceived expertise can influence review judgments.
  Overall, our findings highlight the challenges of invalid report identification and show that combining LLMs with structured reviewer knowledge can support more transparent and consistent vulnerability report review.

*Wei Wang,Hourieh Khalajzadeh,John Grundy,Anuradha Madugalla,Humphrey O. Obie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines user preferences and trade-offs in designing adaptive user interfaces (AUIs) for mobile health (mHealth) applications to enhance chronic disease management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address usability and accessibility challenges of mHealth applications by studying user preferences in adaptive user interface design, ensuring widespread adoption and improved user experience.

Method: A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) with 186 participants was conducted, analyzing preference heterogeneity using a mixed logit model, supplemented by subgroup analyses based on demographic and behavioral factors.

Result: Key factors for adoption include maintaining usability, controllability, infrequent adaptations, and small-scale changes, while frequent function changes and caregiver involvement decrease perceived value. Variations in preferences were observed across subgroups.

Conclusion: The study provides guidance for developing adaptive mHealth applications by identifying user preferences and trade-offs, offering insights to prioritize requirements for future designs in software engineering.

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) applications are widely used for chronic disease management, but usability and accessibility challenges persist due to the diverse needs of users. Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) offer a personalized solution to enhance user experience, yet barriers to adoption remain. Understanding user preferences and trade-offs is essential to ensure widespread acceptance of adaptation designs. This study identifies key factors influencing user preferences and trade-offs in mHealth adaptation design. A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was conducted with 186 participants who have chronic diseases and use mHealth applications. Participants were asked to select preferred adaptation designs from choices featuring six attributes with varying levels. A mixed logit model was used to analyze preference heterogeneity and determine the factors most likely influencing adoption. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed to explore differences by age, gender, health conditions, and coping mechanisms. Maintaining usability while ensuring controllability over adaptations, infrequent adaptations, and small-scale changes are key factors that facilitate the adoption of adaptive mHealth app designs. In contrast, frequently used functions and caregiver involvement can diminish the perceived value of such adaptations. This study employs a data-driven approach to quantify user preferences, identify key trade-offs, and reveal variations across demographic and behavioral subgroups through preference heterogeneity modeling. Furthermore, our results offer valuable guidance for developing future adaptive mHealth applications and lay the groundwork for continued exploration into requirements prioritization within the field of software engineering.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ChroniUXMag introduces a framework to address inclusivity challenges in mHealth app design through persona-driven evaluations and inclusivity facets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent challenges in accessibility and engagement for mHealth applications, especially for patients with evolving needs, necessitate better inclusivity in requirements engineering.

Method: Developed through two stages involving a literature review, surveys, and interviews to identify facets; then synthesized into personas for inclusivity assessments.

Result: Thirteen inclusivity facets were identified to guide persona-driven evaluations, addressing barriers missed by traditional approaches.

Conclusion: ChroniUXMag offers a structured, evidence-based approach to embedding inclusivity in mHealth design, with plans for real-world evaluation by practitioners.

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) applications are increasingly adopted for chronic disease management, yet they face persistent challenges related to accessibility, inclusivity, and sustained engagement. Patients' needs evolve dynamically with their health progression, adherence, and caregiver support, creating unique requirements engineering (RE) challenges that traditional approaches often overlook. This study introduces ChroniUXMag, a framework for eliciting and analysing inclusivity requirements in mHealth design. Building on InclusiveMag and GenderMag principles, the framework aims to help researchers and practitioners systematically capture and evaluate factors that influence how individuals with chronic conditions perceive, trust, and interact with mHealth systems. The framework was developed through two stages of the InclusiveMag process. In the first stage, inclusivity facets were identified through a systematic literature review, focus groups, interviews, and a large-scale survey. In the second stage, these facets were synthesised into personas representing diverse health situations, attitudes, and digital practices, and integrated into an adapted cognitive walkthrough form. Thirteen facets were identified that capture the socio-technical complexity of mHealth use, including trust, digital literacy, dependency, and cultural context. These facets support structured, persona-driven evaluations that reveal inclusivity barriers often missed by traditional usability assessments. ChroniUXMag contributes to RE by offering a reproducible, evidence-based approach for embedding inclusivity into mHealth requirements. Future work will extend the third stage Apply through practitioner-led evaluation in real-world design contexts.

### [787] [Summary-Mediated Repair: Can LLMs use code summarisation as a tool for program repair?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18782)
*Lukas Twist*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'summary-mediated repair,' a prompt-only method leveraging code summaries to improve program repair for LLM-generated code errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate code with subtle implementation-level bugs, which are hard to detect but can affect behavior significantly. The paper seeks to capitalize on LLMs’ ability to summarize code to address these bugs.

Method: Summary-mediated repair involves adding a natural-language code summarization step to program repair pipelines, evaluating its effectiveness using various LLMs and benchmarks.

Result: Error-aware diagnostic summaries improve error correction by up to 65%, outperforming direct repair by an average of 5%, although improvements depend on LLMs and are modest.

Conclusion: Summaries are a useful diagnostic tool for program repair pipelines but should complement, not replace, other approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce code with subtle implementation-level bugs despite strong benchmark performance. These errors are hard for LLMs to spot and can have large behavioural effects; yet when asked to summarise code, LLMs can frequently surface high-level intent and sometimes overlook this low-level noise. Motivated by this, we propose summary-mediated repair, a prompt-only pipeline for program repair that leverages natural-language code summarisation as an explicit intermediate step, extending previous work that has already shown code summarisation to be a useful intermediary for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method across eight production-grade LLMs on two function level benchmarks (HumanEvalPack and MBPP), comparing several summary styles against a direct repair baseline. Error-aware diagnostic summaries consistently yield the largest gains - repairing up to 65% of unseen errors, on average of 5% more than the baseline - though overall improvements are modest and LLM-dependent. Our results position summaries as a cheap, human-interpretable diagnostic artefact that can be integrated into program-repair pipelines rather than a stand-alone fix-all.

### [788] [Optimizing LLM Code Suggestions: Feedback-Driven Timing with Lightweight State Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18842)
*Mohammad Nour Al Awad,Sergey Ivanov,Olga Tikhonova*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the efficiency of code auto-completion in Large Language Models by introducing an adaptive timing mechanism for offering suggestions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness of code auto-completion and reduce inefficiencies caused by poorly-timed suggestions.

Method: The method uses an adaptive timing mechanism based on logistic transforms of acceptance rates and a binary prediction of developers' cognitive states, with bounded delay ranges.

Result: The system increased suggestion acceptance from 4.9% (no delay) to 18.6% (adaptive timing), reduced blind rejections from 8.3% to 0.36%, and cut wasted inference calls by 75%.

Conclusion: Adaptive timing mechanisms can significantly enhance the usability and cost-effectiveness of LLM-based code auto-completions for developers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed code auto-completion by generating context-aware suggestions. Yet, deciding when to present these suggestions remains underexplored, often leading to interruptions or wasted inference calls. We propose an adaptive timing mechanism that dynamically adjusts the delay before offering a suggestion based on real-time developer feedback. Our suggested method combines a logistic transform of recent acceptance rates with a bounded delay range, anchored by a high-level binary prediction of the developer's cognitive state. In a two-month deployment with professional developers, our system improved suggestion acceptance from 4.9% with no delay to 15.4% with static delays, and to 18.6% with adaptive timing-while reducing blind rejections (rejections without being read) from 8.3% to 0.36%. Together, these improvements increase acceptance and substantially reduce wasted inference calls by 75%, making LLM-based code assistants more efficient and cost-effective in practice.

*Mohammad Nour Al Awad,Sergey Ivanov,Olga Tikhonova*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a lightweight pre-filtering model aimed at improving acceptance rates of LLM code suggestions and reducing low-value computational overhead by utilizing behavioral telemetry from developers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of low acceptance rates and inefficiencies in LLM-generated code suggestions within code editors.

Method: A lightweight pre-filtering model using real-time developer telemetry like typing speed, file navigation, and editing activity was introduced to predict suggestion acceptance likelihood before engaging LLMs.

Result: The model, deployed in a Visual Studio Code plugin over four months, doubled acceptance rates (18.4% -> 34.2%) and suppressed 35% of unnecessary LLM calls.

Conclusion: Behavioral signals, rather than code content, can significantly enhance user and system performance in LLM-assisted coding, cementing the importance of timing-aware, privacy-preserving adaptations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into code editors to provide AI-powered code suggestions. Yet many of these suggestions are ignored, resulting in wasted computation, increased latency, and unnecessary interruptions. We introduce a lightweight pre-filtering model that predicts the likelihood of suggestion acceptance before invoking the LLM, using only real-time developer telemetry such as typing speed, file navigation, and editing activity. Deployed in a production-grade Visual Studio Code plugin over four months of naturalistic use, our approach nearly doubled acceptance rates (18.4% -> 34.2%) while suppressing 35% of low-value LLM calls. These findings demonstrate that behavioral signals alone can meaningfully improve both user experience and system efficiency in LLM-assisted programming, highlighting the value of timing-aware, privacy-preserving adaptation mechanisms. The filter operates solely on pre-invocation editor telemetry and never inspects code or prompts.

### [790] [Time Travel: LLM-Assisted Semantic Behavior Localization with Git Bisect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18854)
*Yujing Wang,Weize Hong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the Git bisect process by addressing challenges in modern software development like flaky tests and semantic changes. The method improves efficiency and reduces errors in locating software faults.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Git bisect often fails under non-deterministic conditions like flaky tests, nonmonotonic regressions, or semantic divergence, which are common in modern software development. This motivates the need for a new method to handle fault localization under such noisy conditions.

Method: The authors propose integrating LLMs with a structured chain-of-thought process for commit-by-commit analysis. They fine-tuned a model, DeepSeekCoderV2, using QLoRA on labeled diffs and incorporated weak supervision with human-in-the-loop corrections to address annotation overhead.

Result: Experiments demonstrated a 6.4% increase in success rate (from 74.2% to 80.6%) for fault localization on open-source projects. This led to fewer failed traversals and up to a 2x reduction in average bisect time.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of augmenting the Git bisect process with LLMs, achieving better efficiency and performance. Additionally, it highlights the importance of prompt design, temporal reasoning, and customized finetuning strategies for commit-level analysis.

Abstract: We present a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into the Git bisect process for semantic fault localization. Traditional bisect assumes deterministic predicates and binary failure states assumptions often violated in modern software development due to flaky tests, nonmonotonic regressions, and semantic divergence from upstream repositories. Our system augments bisect traversal with structured chain of thought reasoning, enabling commit by commit analysis under noisy conditions. We evaluate multiple open source and proprietary LLMs for their suitability and fine tune DeepSeekCoderV2 using QLoRA on a curated dataset of semantically labeled diffs. We adopt a weak supervision workflow to reduce annotation overhead, incorporating human in the loop corrections and self consistency filtering. Experiments across multiple open source projects show a 6.4 point absolute gain in success rate from 74.2 to 80.6 percent, leading to significantly fewer failed traversals and by experiment up to 2x reduction in average bisect time. We conclude with discussions on temporal reasoning, prompt design, and finetuning strategies tailored for commit level behavior analysis.

### [791] [VecIntrinBench: Benchmarking Cross-Architecture Intrinsic Code Migration for RISC-V Vector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18867)
*Liutong Han,Chu Kang,Mingjie Xing,Yanjun Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces VecIntrinBench, a benchmark for evaluating intrinsic function migration to the RISC-V Vector extension, showcasing the capabilities of various migration approaches, especially Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of benchmarks to assess intrinsic code migration for RISC-V Vector (RVV) extensions, a significant need given the growing demand for algorithm library adaptation in the RISC-V ecosystem.

Method: The authors developed VecIntrinBench, a comprehensive intrinsic benchmark with 50 function-level tasks, evaluating functions across architectures (scalar, RVV, Arm Neon, x86 intrinsics) and testing code migration approaches.

Result: Insights indicate that LLMs perform efficiently in RISC-V code migration, comparable to rule-based methods, while achieving better overall performance.

Conclusion: VecIntrinBench provides an essential tool for the RISC-V community, highlighting LLM potential in code migration and paving the way for future improvements in this field.

Abstract: Intrinsic functions are specialized functions provided by the compiler that efficiently operate on architecture-specific hardware, allowing programmers to write optimized code in a high-level language that fully exploits hardware features. Using intrinsics to vectorize core code blocks is a standard optimization method in high-performance libraries, often requiring specific vector optimization implementations for multiple mainstream architectures. The promising RISC-V software ecosystem has a significant demand for algorithm library migration and adaptation. Translating existing intrinsic functions to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsic functions across architectures is currently a mainstream approach. Rule-based intrinsic mapping methods and LLM-based code generation can help developers address the code migration challenge. However, existing intrinsic code benchmarks focus on mainstream SIMD intrinsics and lack support for the emerging RISC-V architecture. There is currently no benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the intrinsic migration capabilities for the RVV extension. To fill this gap, we propose VecIntrinBench, the first intrinsic benchmark encompassing RVV extensions. It includes 50 function-level tasks from open source repositories, implemented as scalars, RVV intrinsics, Arm Neon intrinsics, and x86 intrinsics, along with comprehensive functional and performance test cases. We systematically evaluated various code migration approaches on VecIntrinBench, yielding a series of insightful findings. The results demonstrate that advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve a similar effect as rule-based mapping approaches for RISC-V code migration, while also delivering superior performance. We further analyze the reasons and identify future directions for LLM development in the code migration field. The VecIntrinBench is open-sourced to benefit the broader community and developers.

TL;DR: This paper introduces OATest, a testing approach aimed at improving bug identification in deep learning (DL) compilers' optimization stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure reliability and security of DL compilers by addressing the challenges in testing their optimization functionality.

Method: OATest synthesizes optimization-aware computational graphs by extracting patterns from documented tests and modifying seed computational graphs using two strategies: edges reusing and auxiliary layers addition.

Result: OATest detects 58 previously unknown bugs, achieves higher code coverage, and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in testing TVM and ONNXRuntime.

Conclusion: OATest successfully improves testing reliability in DL compilers, proving its value in identifying bugs and optimizing software quality.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) compilers have been widely utilized to optimize DL models for efficient deployment across various hardware. Due to their vital role in the DL ecosystem, ensuring their reliability and security is critical. However, existing approaches have limitations in testing optimization stages, which is the core functionality of DL compilers, due to the difficulty in generating optimization-aware tests. In this paper, we proposed OATest, a novel approach for synthesizing optimization-aware computational graphs. The approach combines patterns extracted from documented tests for optimization and incorporates them into seed computational graphs, enabling broader exploration of optimization paths. To guarantee the optimization-awareness of generated graphs, OATest introduces the edges reusing strategy to establish strong connections between patterns and contexts. Additionally, to solve the validity challenge for the generated graphs, OATest employs an auxiliary layers addition strategy to resolve broken constraints. Equipped with two distinct test oracles, OATest applies differential testing to evaluate the two widely used DL compilers (i.e., TVM and ONNXRuntime). Our experimental results show that OATest outperforms the state-of-the-art method by detecting more bugs and achieving higher code coverage in TVM and ONNXRutimes. Additionally, OATest uncovers 58 previously unknown bugs, 36 of which have been confirmed or fixed by developers.

Motivation: The evolution of the Linux kernel frequently breaks drivers due to API/ABI changes, requiring tools to automate driver maintenance and ensure compatibility.

Method: The authors developed AUTODRIVER, a system integrating LLM-driven patch generation, prompt engineering, multi-agent setups, static analysis, and iterative validation. They also created DRIVEBENCH, a corpus of validated kernel-driver evolution cases.

Result: AUTODRIVER achieved 56.4% compilation success in 55 test cases, with most compiled patches maintaining driver initialization verified via QEMU-based testing.

Conclusion: By releasing DRIVEBENCH and AUTODRIVER tools, the authors contribute to automating driver maintenance to align with Linux kernel updates, enabling reproducible research and ongoing improvement of kernel-driver compatibility.

Abstract: Linux kernel evolution breaks drivers through API/ABI changes, semantic shifts, and security-hardening updates. We introduce DRIVEBENCH, an executable corpus of kernel$\rightarrow$driver co-evolution cases, and AUTODRIVER, a closed-loop, LLM-driven system for automating driver maintenance. The system integrates prompt engineering, multi-agent collaboration, static analysis, and iterative validation to ensure that generated patches are not only syntactically correct but also functionally and semantically consistent with kernel conventions. The corpus spans v5.10-v6.10 with 235 validated cases drawn from 612 candidates. In evaluation across 55 cases, AUTODRIVER achieves 56.4% compilation success; QEMU-based boot verification indicates that compiled patches preserve driver initialization in most instances. By releasing DRIVEBENCH and tooling, we enable reproducible research and a practical route to continuous, safe co-evolution of drivers with the Linux kernel.

TL;DR: LLMAID is a framework designed to identify AI features in mobile applications, demonstrating improved performance and efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of detecting AI capabilities in mobile apps, given the limitations of existing manual and rule-based methods that are costly, inefficient, and difficult to adapt to advanced AI techniques.

Method: The proposed system, LLMAID, consists of four primary tasks: (1) candidate extraction, (2) knowledge base interaction, (3) AI capability analysis and detection, and (4) AI service summarization.

Result: LLMAID outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based methods by detecting 242% more AI-related apps, achieving over 90% precision and recall. Developers also prefer summaries generated by LLMAID over original app descriptions.

Conclusion: LLMAID effectively addresses gaps in identifying AI functionality in mobile software, provides precise detection and summarization, and reveals a strong focus on computer vision tasks in AI applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and its widespread integration into mobile software applications have received significant attention, highlighting the growing prominence of AI capabilities in modern software systems. However, the inherent hallucination and reliability issues of AI continue to raise persistent concerns. Consequently, application users and regulators increasingly ask critical questions such as: Does the application incorporate AI capabilities? and What specific types of AI functionalities are embedded? Preliminary efforts have been made to identify AI capabilities in mobile software; however, existing approaches mainly rely on manual inspection and rule-based heuristics. These methods are not only costly and time-consuming but also struggle to adapt advanced AI techniques.
  To address the limitations of existing methods, we propose LLMAID (Large Language Model for AI Discovery). LLMAID includes four main tasks: (1) candidate extraction, (2) knowledge base interaction, (3) AI capability analysis and detection, and (4) AI service summarization. We apply LLMAID to a dataset of 4,201 Android applications and demonstrate that it identifies 242% more real-world AI apps than state-of-the-art rule-based approaches. Our experiments show that LLM4AID achieves high precision and recall, both exceeding 90%, in detecting AI-related components. Additionally, a user study indicates that developers find the AI service summaries generated by LLMAID to be more informative and preferable to the original app descriptions. Finally, we leverage LLMAID to perform an empirical analysis of AI capabilities across Android apps. The results reveal a strong concentration of AI functionality in computer vision (54.80%), with object detection emerging as the most common task (25.19%).

*Rong Feng,Suman Saha*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using fine-tuned LLMs combined with symbolic execution artifacts to deobfuscate programs, achieving enhanced code readability and semantic recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software obfuscation impedes program comprehension, maintenance, testing, and vulnerability detection. Existing analysis tools struggle with recovering original semantics from obfuscated code.

Method: Develop a benchmark with four obfuscation methods on diverse C programs and fine-tune state-of-the-art LLMs using obfuscated/original code pairs with additional symbolic execution artifacts.

Result: GPT-4.1-mini demonstrated superior deobfuscation performance, with symbolic execution artifacts enhancing semantic preservation and compilation success across models.

Conclusion: Symbolic execution and fine-tuned LLMs offer promising methods for overcoming software obfuscation, improving program comprehension and analysis tools.

Abstract: Obfuscation poses a persistent challenge for software engineering tasks such as program comprehension, maintenance, testing, and vulnerability detection. While compiler optimizations and third-party code often introduce transformations that obscure program intent, existing analysis tools and large language models (LLMs) struggle to recover the original semantics. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs, when fine-tuned with symbolic execution artifacts, can effectively deobfuscate programs and restore analyzability. We construct a benchmark by applying four widely studied transformations-control-flow flattening, opaque predicates, arithmetic encoding, and branch encoding-across diverse C programs from TUM Obfuscation Benchmarks, the LLVM test suite, and algorithmic repositories. We then compare three state-of-the-art LLMs under two training configurations: baseline fine-tuning on obfuscated/original code pairs, and enhanced fine-tuning with additional KLEE artifacts such as SMT constraints, path statistics, and test cases. Our evaluation examines syntactic correctness (compilation success), semantic fidelity (behavioral equivalence under symbolic execution), and code quality (readability and structure). Results show that GPT-4.1-mini achieves the strongest deobfuscation overall, and that incorporating KLEE artifacts consistently improves semantic preservation and compilation success across models. These findings highlight deobfuscation as a broader software engineering concern, demonstrating that combining LLMs with symbolic execution can strengthen automated testing, static analysis, and program comprehension in the presence of obfuscation.

*Mohammad Abboush,Ahmad Hatahet,Andreas Rausch*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel LLM-assisted approach to generate fault test cases for fault injection testing of automotive software systems, offering improved efficiency and safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fault injection testing requires manual identification of fault attributes, which becomes inefficient, costly, and labor-intensive for complex systems.

Method: The paper leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically gpt-4o, to automatically generate fault test cases from functional safety requirements, focusing on representativeness and coverage.

Result: The proposed method achieves high performance in fault test case generation and classification with F1-scores of 97.5% and 88%, and successfully executes test cases on a hardware-in-the-loop system.

Conclusion: By automating fault test case generation with LLMs, the approach optimizes real-time testing processes, reduces costs, and enhances the safety properties of automotive software systems.

Abstract: A well-known testing method for the safety evaluation and real-time validation of automotive software systems (ASSs) is Fault Injection (FI). In accordance with the ISO 26262 standard, the faults are introduced artificially for the purpose of analyzing the safety properties and verifying the safety mechanisms during the development phase. However, the current FI method and tools have a significant limitation in that they require manual identification of FI attributes, including fault type, location and time. The more complex the system, the more expensive, time-consuming and labour-intensive the process. To address the aforementioned challenge, a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted fault test cases (TCs) generation approach for utilization during real-time FI tests is proposed in this paper. To this end, considering the representativeness and coverage criteria, the applicability of various LLMs to create fault TCs from the functional safety requirements (FSRs) has been investigated. Through the validation results of LLMs, the superiority of the proposed approach utilizing gpt-4o in comparison to other state-of-the-art models has been demonstrated. Specifically, the proposed approach exhibits high performance in terms of FSRs classification and fault TCs generation with F1-score of 88% and 97.5%, respectively. To illustrate the proposed approach, the generated fault TCs were executed in real time on a hardware-in-the-loop system, where a high-fidelity automotive system model served as a case study. This novel approach offers a means of optimizing the real-time testing process, thereby reducing costs while simultaneously enhancing the safety properties of complex safety-critical ASSs.

### [797] [Synthesizing Test Cases for Narrowing Specification Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19177)
*Alcino Cunha,Nuno Macedo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a technique for selecting the most suitable formal specification among candidates using test cases classified by users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to streamline the selection process of formal specifications by narrowing choices effectively.

Method: Two solver-based algorithms—an optimal algorithm for minimal test suites and a non-optimal algorithm for scalability—are proposed and implemented in a prototype.

Result: The evaluation shows the optimal algorithm is efficient for practical problems, and the non-optimal algorithm handles larger sets while generating manageable test suites.

Conclusion: The proposed technique aids in selecting the best formal specification quickly and effectively, demonstrating scalability and practicality.

Abstract: This paper proposes a technique to help choose the best formal specification candidate among a set of alternatives. Given a set of specifications, our technique generates a suite of test cases that, once classified by the user as desirable or not, narrows down the set of candidates to at most one specification. Two alternative solver-based algorithms are proposed, one that generates a minimal test suite, and another that does not ensure minimality. Both algorithms were implemented in a prototype that can be used generate test suites to help choose among alternative Alloy specifications. Our evaluation of this prototype against a large set of problems showed that the optimal algorithm is efficient enough for many practical problems, and that the non-optimal algorithm can scale up to dozens of candidate specifications while still generating reasonably sized test suites.

*Jayanaka L. Dantanarayana,Savini Kashmira,Thakee Nathees,Zichen Zhang,Krisztian Flautner,Lingjia Tang,Jason Mars*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Engineering, a method to help LLM-based systems better understand developer intent through lightweight semantic enrichment, compared to manual prompt design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contextual cues, developer intent, and domain-specific reasoning are difficult to capture using only static code semantics, creating challenges for LLM integrations in real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose Semantic Context Annotations (SemTexts), allowing developers to embed natural language context into program constructs, integrated in the Jac programming language to enhance automatic prompt generation.

Result: Semantic Engineering improves the quality of generated prompts, achieving comparable performance to Prompt Engineering but with significantly less effort from developers.

Conclusion: Semantic Engineering bridges gaps in developer intent and contextual understanding for LLM-based systems, enhancing alignment and reducing the burden of manual prompt design.

Abstract: AI-Integrated programming is emerging as a foundational paradigm for building intelligent systems with large language models (LLMs). Recent approaches such as Meaning Typed Programming (MTP) automate prompt generation by leveraging the semantics already present in code. However, many real-world applications depend on contextual cues, developer intent, and domain-specific reasoning that extend beyond what static code semantics alone can express. To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Engineering, a lightweight method for enriching program semantics so that LLM-based systems can more accurately reflect developer intent without requiring full manual prompt design. We present Semantic Context Annotations (SemTexts), a language-level mechanism that allows developers to embed natural-language context directly into program constructs. Integrated into the Jac programming language, Semantic Engineering extends MTP to incorporate these enriched semantics during prompt generation. We further introduce a benchmark suite designed to reflect realistic AI-Integrated application scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Semantic Engineering substantially improves prompt fidelity, achieving performance comparable to Prompt Engineering while requiring significantly less developer effort.

*Ahmed Gamal Eldin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores brain-body interaction mechanisms during cognition using EEG, showing bidirectional coupling and thermodynamic processes driving transitions distinct from artificial intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research investigates the role of physiological signals in cognition, challenging the idea that they are mere artifacts corrupting neural processing, given their functional correlation.

Method: High-density EEG (64 channels) was used on 10 subjects and analyzed with Phase Slope Index, Ridge-regularized Granger causality, and time-resolved entropy analysis.

Result: The findings revealed zero-lag synchrony, bidirectional resonance, and thermodynamic sequences causing non-linear information integration, suggesting binary threshold dynamics.

Conclusion: Brain-body resonance operates as a discrete gate enabling complex information processing, highlighting potential distinctions between biological and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Current models treat physiological signals as noise corrupting neural computation. Previously, we showed that removing these "artifacts" eliminates 70% of predictive correlation, suggesting body signals functionally drive cognition. Here, we investigate the mechanism using high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500+ trials) during P300 target recognition.
  Phase Slope Index revealed zero-lag synchrony (PSI=0.000044, p=0.061) with high coherence (0.316, p<0.0001). Ridge-regularized Granger causality showed massive bidirectional coupling (F=100.53 brain-to-body, F=62.76 body-to-brain) peaking simultaneously at 78.1ms, consistent with mutually coupled resonance pairs.
  Time-resolved entropy analysis (200ms windows, 25ms steps) revealed triphasic dynamics: (1) constraint accumulation (0-78ms) building causal drive without entropy change (delta-S=-0.002 bits, p=0.75); (2) supercritical transition (100-600ms) triggering state expansion (58% directional increase, binomial p=0.002); (3) sustained metastability. Critically, transition magnitude was uncorrelated with resonance strength (r=-0.044, p=0.327), indicating binary threshold dynamics.
  Understanding emerges through a thermodynamic sequence: brain-body resonance acts as a discrete gate triggering non-linear information integration. This architecture may fundamentally distinguish biological from artificial intelligence.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Brain-MGF, a multimodal graph fusion network that integrates EEG and fMRI data to analyze psilocybin's effects on brain connectivity, achieving high classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how psychedelics like psilocybin affect brain connectivity across different measurement modalities (EEG and fMRI) to better characterise neural organisation.

Method: The paper develops Brain-MGF, which constructs graph-based embeddings for EEG and fMRI data and fuses them adaptively using a softmax gate for psilocybin analysis.

Result: Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from non-psilocybin states with high accuracy (74.0%-76.0%) and improved multimodal fusion performance.

Conclusion: Adaptive graph fusion effectively combines EEG and fMRI data, providing a robust tool for analysing psilocybin's impact on large-scale brain connectivity, supporting clearer insights.

Abstract: Psychedelics, such as psilocybin, reorganise large-scale brain connectivity, yet how these changes are reflected across electrophysiological (electroencephalogram, EEG) and haemodynamic (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) networks remains unclear. We present Brain-MGF, a multimodal graph fusion network for joint EEG-fMRI connectivity analysis. For each modality, we construct graphs with partial-correlation edges and Pearson-profile node features, and learn subject-level embeddings via graph convolution. An adaptive softmax gate then fuses modalities with sample-specific weights to capture context-dependent contributions. Using the world's largest single-site psilocybin dataset, PsiConnect, Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from no-psilocybin conditions in meditation and rest. Fusion improves over unimodal and non-adaptive variants, achieving 74.0% accuracy and 76.5% F1 score on meditation, and 76.0% accuracy with 85.8% ROC-AUC on rest. UMAP visualisations reveal clearer class separation for fused embeddings. These results indicate that adaptive graph fusion effectively integrates complementary EEG-fMRI information, providing an interpretable framework for characterising psilocybin-induced alterations in large-scale neural organisation.

*Sophie Béraud-Dufour,Ilona Legroux,Thierry Coppola,Patricia Lebrun,Nicolas Blondeau*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of nutraceuticals, natural bioactive compounds, in reducing the risk and impact of ischemic stroke by activating protective pathways and addressing key injury drivers like oxidative stress and inflammation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limited effectiveness of current ischemic stroke pharmacotherapy and the need for novel, safer alternatives to overcome the challenges related to conventional drugs.

Method: The review investigates the protective mechanisms of nutraceutical compounds, such as omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols, and their effects on the neurovascular unit.

Result: Numerous preclinical studies indicate that nutraceuticals can reduce ischemic stroke risks and enhance cellular protection against injury through mechanisms like anti-inflammation and apoptosis reduction.

Conclusion: Nutraceuticals act as brain preconditioners with potential for both preventative and therapeutic neuroprotection against ischemic stroke.

Abstract: Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, with ischemic strokes accounting for nearly 80% of cases. Fewer than 5% of patients receive the sole validated pharmacotherapy, intravenous thrombolysis, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. Within this landscape, the exploration of natural molecules emerges as a promising avenue, particularly as a means to address limitations associated with conventional drugs. Nutraceuticals, bioactive compounds derived from food sources, offer a compelling prospect for health and wellness. The term nutraceutical reflects their dual potential in nutrition and pharmacotherapy, emphasizing their relevance to both disease prevention and treatment. Interestingly, many were initially recognized as ''natural preconditioners'', substances that prime the body for protection against stress or damage. In fact, numerous nutraceuticals have been shown to activate protective pathways similar to those triggered by preconditioning across various organs. Among nutraceuticals, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids sourced from plants or fish, along with polyphenols, have emerged as particularly promising. Their consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, supported by numerous preclinical studies demonstrating their beneficial effects on cellular components within the neurovascular unit. This review explores the shared protective mechanisms of various nutraceuticals against key drivers of ischemic injury, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. By delineating these actions, the review highlights the potential of nutraceuticals as brain preconditioners that enhance neuroprotection, thereby mitigating the impact of cerebral ischemia in both preventive and therapeutic contexts.

### [802] [Quantum Fourier Transform Based Kernel for Solar Irrandiance Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17698)
*Nawfel Mechiche-Alami,Eduardo Rodriguez,Jose M. Cardemil,Enrique Lopez Droguett*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This study introduces a Quantum Fourier Transform-enhanced quantum kernel for short-term time-series forecasting, demonstrating improved predictive performance over classical methods on solar irradiance data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and reduce errors in short-term time-series forecasting, particularly under volatile conditions, using quantum computing enhancements.

Method: Proposed a quantum kernel leveraging Quantum Fourier Transform, amplitude encoding, and a protective rotation layer combined with kernel ridge regression. Exogenous predictors are incorporated by fusing feature-specific kernels.

Result: The proposed kernel showed better performance (higher R2, lower nRMSE, and reduced bias) compared to classical kernels like RBF and polynomials using solar irradiance data. Tight average errors were achieved despite remaining challenges.

Conclusion: The QFT-enhanced kernel outperforms classical methods in time-series forecasting, with demonstrated potential for improved accuracy even under transient conditions. Suggestions for NISQ execution and limitations were discussed.

Abstract: This study proposes a Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)-enhanced quantum kernel for short-term time-series forecasting. Each signal is windowed, amplitude-encoded, transformed by a QFT, then passed through a protective rotation layer to avoid the QFT/QFT adjoint cancellation; the resulting kernel is used in kernel ridge regression (KRR). Exogenous predictors are incorporated by convexly fusing feature-specific kernels. On multi-station solar irradiance data across Koppen climate classes, the proposed kernel consistently improves median R2 and nRMSE over reference classical RBF and polynomials kernels, while also reducing bias (nMBE); complementary MAE/ERMAX analyses indicate tighter average errors with remaining headroom under sharp transients. For both quantum and classical models, the only tuned quantities are the feature-mixing weights and the KRR ridge alpha; classical hyperparameters (gamma, r, d) are fixed, with the same validation set size for all models. Experiments are conducted on a noiseless simulator (5 qubits; window length L=32). Limitations and ablations are discussed, and paths toward NISQ execution are outlined.

*Shreya Sinha-Roy,Richard G. Everitt,Christian P. Robert,Ritabrata Dutta*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes prequential posteriors to advance data assimilation in deep generative forecasting models (DGFMs), using scalable and efficient methods for dynamic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Bayesian data assimilation approaches are limited for DGFMs due to their intractable likelihood functions. There is a need to overcome this challenge to improve forecasting models in various domains.

Method: The paper introduces prequential posteriors based on a predictive-sequential loss function. It employs wastefree sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers with preconditioned gradient-based kernels for scalable inference.

Result: The proposed method is validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating improved data assimilation performance for complex dynamical systems.

Conclusion: Prequential posteriors enable effective assimilation of temporally dependent data in DGFMs, offering practical utility for forecasting tasks in high-dimensional and complex settings.

Abstract: Data assimilation is a fundamental task in updating forecasting models upon observing new data, with applications ranging from weather prediction to online reinforcement learning. Deep generative forecasting models (DGFMs) have shown excellent performance in these areas, but assimilating data into such models is challenging due to their intractable likelihood functions. This limitation restricts the use of standard Bayesian data assimilation methodologies for DGFMs. To overcome this, we introduce prequential posteriors, based upon a predictive-sequential (prequential) loss function; an approach naturally suited for temporally dependent data which is the focus of forecasting tasks. Since the true data-generating process often lies outside the assumed model class, we adopt an alternative notion of consistency and prove that, under mild conditions, both the prequential loss minimizer and the prequential posterior concentrate around parameters with optimal predictive performance. For scalable inference, we employ easily parallelizable wastefree sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers with preconditioned gradient-based kernels, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces such as those in DGFMs. We validate our method on both a synthetic multi-dimensional time series and a real-world meteorological dataset; highlighting its practical utility for data assimilation for complex dynamical systems.

### [804] [Variational Estimators for Node Popularity Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17783)
*Jony Karki,Dongzhou Huang,Yunpeng Zhao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper develops a computationally efficient method, VEM framework, for modeling node popularity in bipartite and undirected networks, improving accuracy and practical effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Node popularity is a key aspect of modeling heterogeneous connections in networks, but existing methods like TSDC have limitations in accuracy or applicability.

Method: The authors propose a variational expectation-maximization (VEM) framework tailored to the TNPM, ensuring label consistency and improved computational efficiency.

Result: Simulations and real-world evaluations demonstrate superior estimation accuracy and robustness of the VEM method in bipartite and undirected networks compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The VEM framework advances the modeling of node popularity by providing an accurate and efficient solution for both bipartite and undirected networks.

Abstract: Node popularity is recognized as a key factor in modeling real-world networks, capturing heterogeneity in connectivity across communities. This concept is equally important in bipartite networks, where nodes in different partitions may exhibit varying popularity patterns, motivating models such as the Two-Way Node Popularity Model (TNPM). Existing methods, such as the Two-Stage Divided Cosine (TSDC) algorithm, provide a scalable estimation approach but may have limitations in terms of accuracy or applicability across different types of networks. In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient and theoretically justified variational expectation-maximization (VEM) framework for the TNPM. We establish label consistency for the estimated community assignments produced by the proposed variational estimator in bipartite networks. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our method achieves superior estimation accuracy across a range of bipartite as well as undirected networks compared to existing algorithms. Finally, we evaluate our method on real-world bipartite and undirected networks, further demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness.

*Francesca Romana Crucinio,Sahani Pathiraja*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of operator ordering in Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) gradient flows and reveals that specific splitting schemes can outperform the exact WFR flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches used operator splitting techniques for WFR gradient flows but lacked systematic analysis of the ordering impact on convergence speed and target distribution.

Method: Quantitative analysis through variational formulae and theoretical investigation of sequential splitting schemes. Additionally, preservation of log-concavity and derivation of sharp decay bounds for WFR flows.

Result: It demonstrates that specific step sizes and operator order in split schemes can achieve faster convergence compared to exact WFR flows.

Conclusion: Optimal ordering and step size selection in WFR split schemes can improve convergence to target distributions, enhancing their practical utility.

Abstract: Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) gradient flows have been recently proposed as a powerful sampling tool that combines the advantages of pure Wasserstein (W) and pure Fisher-Rao (FR) gradient flows. Existing algorithmic developments implicitly make use of operator splitting techniques to numerically approximate the WFR partial differential equation, whereby the W flow is evaluated over a given step size and then the FR flow (or vice versa). This works investigates the impact of the order in which the W and FR operator are evaluated and aims to provide a quantitative analysis. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that with a judicious choice of step size and operator ordering, the split scheme can converge to the target distribution faster than the exact WFR flow (in terms of model time). We obtain variational formulae describing the evolution over one time step of both sequential splitting schemes and investigate in which settings the W-FR split should be preferred to the FR-W split. As a step towards this goal we show that the WFR gradient flow preserves log-concavity and obtain the first sharp decay bound for WFR.

*Lucas P. Amaral,Luben M. C. Cabezas,Thiago R. Ramos,Gustavo H. G. A. Pereira*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces conformal prediction methods for compositional responses, ensuring finite-sample coverage while preserving simplex geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve uncertainty quantification in prediction tasks where responses are compositional proportions that sum to one.

Method: The authors build on Dirichlet regression, introducing quantile residual- and grid-refined HDR-based conformal approaches. These methods respect simplex geometry and maintain finite-sample coverage guarantees under exchangeability.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations show that grid-refined HDR methods provide close-to-target coverage and narrower prediction intervals compared to other approaches. Application on real-world data demonstrates practical utility.

Conclusion: Conformal prediction on compositional data can achieve both calibration and efficiency, offering effective uncertainty quantification in related tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a set of conformal prediction procedures tailored to compositional responses, where outcomes are proportions that must be positive and sum to one. Building on Dirichlet regression, we introduce a split conformal approach based on quantile residuals and a highest-density region strategy that combines a fast coordinate-floor approximation with an internal grid refinement to restore sharpness. Both constructions are model-agnostic at the conformal layer and guarantee finite-sample marginal coverage under exchangeability, while respecting the geometry of the simplex. A comprehensive Monte Carlo study spanning homoscedastic and heteroscedastic designs shows that the quantile residual and grid-refined HDR methods achieve empirical coverage close to the nominal 90\% level and produce substantially narrower regions than the coordinate-floor approximation, which tends to be conservative. We further demonstrate the methods on household budget shares from the BudgetItaly dataset, using standardized socioeconomic and price covariates with a train, calibration, and test split. In this application, the grid-refined HDR attains coverage closest to the target with the smallest average widths, closely followed by the quantile residual approach, while the simple triangular HDR yields wider, less informative sets. Overall, the results indicate that conformal prediction on the simplex can be both calibrated and efficient, providing practical uncertainty quantification for compositional prediction tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high dimensional M-estimation problems, there is a need for algorithms that maintain stable performance even as the ambient dimension increases, without sacrificing solution sparsity and accuracy.

Method: The paper analyzes Sparse Polyak's adaptive step-size rule and proposes a novel variant that enhances solution sparsity and statistical accuracy while preserving adaptive scaling properties.

Result: The proposed variant achieves sparser and more accurate solutions for high-dimensional M-estimation problems while retaining favorable scaling properties.

Conclusion: The variant of Sparse Polyak successfully addresses the trade-off between sparsity, statistical accuracy, and scalability for high-dimensional M-estimation problems.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a variant of Sparse Polyak for high dimensional M-estimation problems. Sparse Polyak proposes a novel adaptive step-size rule tailored to suitably estimate the problem's curvature in the high-dimensional setting, guaranteeing that the algorithm's performance does not deteriorate when the ambient dimension increases. However, convergence guarantees can only be obtained by sacrificing solution sparsity and statistical accuracy. In this work, we introduce a variant of Sparse Polyak that retains its desirable scaling properties with respect to the ambient dimension while obtaining sparser and more accurate solutions.

*Genesis Hang,Annie Chen,Hope Neveux,Matthew K. Nock,Yaniv Yacoby*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces Latent Similarity Gaussian Processes (LSGPs) to improve predictions of rare suicide attempts by utilizing patient similarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to predict rare events like suicide attempts due to patient heterogeneity and data sparsity.

Method: The study proposes LSGPs, which use trends from similar patients to address limited data and avoid overfitting in individualized models.

Result: Preliminary results show LSGPs outperform most baseline models and provide insights into patient similarities.

Conclusion: LSGPs represent a promising approach for handling patient heterogeneity and addressing limitations in predicting suicidal behaviors.

Abstract: Ecological Momentary Assessment provides real-time data on suicidal thoughts and behaviors, but predicting suicide attempts remains challenging due to their rarity and patient heterogeneity. We show that single models fit to all patients perform poorly, while individualized models improve performance but still overfit to patients with limited data. To address this, we introduce Latent Similarity Gaussian Processes (LSGPs) to capture patient heterogeneity, enabling those with little data to leverage similar patients' trends. Preliminary results show promise: even without kernel-design, we outperform all but one baseline while offering a new understanding of patient similarity.

TL;DR: The paper develops a new method to select the best heterogeneous treatment effect estimator without observing the treatment effect, using a novel statistically valid procedure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting the best HTE estimator in situations where the treatment effects cannot be directly observed, ensuring reliability and validity in the estimator selection process.

Method: The authors propose a procedure based on a cross-fitted, exponentially weighted test statistic utilizing a two-way sample splitting scheme. This approach isolates nuisance estimation from weight learning, facilitating valid inference via a stability-based central limit theorem.

Result: The proposed method achieves reliable error control while significantly reducing false selections compared to existing methods in benchmarks such as ACIC 2016, IHDP, and Twins datasets.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates feasibility and high performance even in the absence of ground-truth treatment effects, offering a robust solution for HTE estimator selection.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting the best heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimator from a collection of candidates in settings where the treatment effect is fundamentally unobserved. We cast estimator selection as a multiple testing problem and introduce a ground-truth-free procedure based on a cross-fitted, exponentially weighted test statistic. A key component of our method is a two-way sample splitting scheme that decouples nuisance estimation from weight learning and ensures the stability required for valid inference. Leveraging a stability-based central limit theorem, we establish asymptotic familywise error rate control under mild regularity conditions. Empirically, our procedure provides reliable error control while substantially reducing false selections compared with commonly used methods across ACIC 2016, IHDP, and Twins benchmarks, demonstrating that our method is feasible and powerful even without ground-truth treatment effects.

Motivation: To address the challenges in conditional density estimation, particularly in high-dimensional settings, by leveraging effective regression methods.

Method: The paper introduces a transformation of conditional density estimation into a single nonparametric regression task using auxiliary samples and showcases a method called condensité for achieving this.

Result: The paper finds that condensité matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing accurate conditional densities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach, condensité, demonstrates new possibilities for regression-based conditional density estimation and shows strong promise for applied research.

Abstract: We propose a way of transforming the problem of conditional density estimation into a single nonparametric regression task via the introduction of auxiliary samples. This allows leveraging regression methods that work well in high dimensions, such as neural networks and decision trees. Our main theoretical result characterizes and establishes the convergence of our estimator to the true conditional density in the data limit. We develop condensité, a method that implements this approach. We demonstrate the benefit of the auxiliary samples on synthetic data and showcase that condensité can achieve good out-of-the-box results. We evaluate our method on a large population survey dataset and on a satellite imaging dataset. In both cases, we find that condensité matches or outperforms the state of the art and yields conditional densities in line with established findings in the literature on each dataset. Our contribution opens up new possibilities for regression-based conditional density estimation and the empirical results indicate strong promise for applied research.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of split conformal prediction under adversarial perturbations, focusing on both coverage validity and prediction set size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of how conformal prediction can maintain its coverage guarantees and robustness under adversarial perturbations and distribution shifts.

Method: Theoretical analysis was conducted to understand the effects of adversarial calibration-time attacks, complemented by experiments. The method also examines adversarial training to control coverage and improve prediction set informativeness.

Result: The study found that prediction coverage depends on calibration-time attack strength, optimal calibration attacks can maintain target coverage across different perturbation levels, and adversarial training leads to more informative and narrower prediction sets.

Conclusion: With careful calibration-time attack strength and adversarial training during model training, split conformal prediction can effectively adapt to adversarial conditions while maintaining coverage and informativeness.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides distribution-free, finite-sample coverage guarantees but critically relies on exchangeability, a condition often violated under distribution shift. We study the robustness of split conformal prediction under adversarial perturbations at test time, focusing on both coverage validity and the resulting prediction set size. Our theoretical analysis characterizes how the strength of adversarial perturbations during calibration affects coverage guarantees under adversarial test conditions. We further examine the impact of adversarial training at the model-training stage. Extensive experiments support our theory: (i) Prediction coverage varies monotonically with the calibration-time attack strength, enabling the use of nonzero calibration-time attack to predictably control coverage under adversarial tests; (ii) target coverage can hold over a range of test-time attacks: with a suitable calibration attack, coverage stays within any chosen tolerance band across a contiguous set of perturbation levels; and (iii) adversarial training at the training stage produces tighter prediction sets that retain high informativeness.

### [812] [Differential privacy with dependent data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18583)
*Valentin Roth,Marco Avella-Medina*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of differential privacy (DP) in datasets involving dependent data, showing how Winsorized mean estimators can be employed effectively under these conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for this research arises from the challenge of ensuring data privacy in datasets with dependent data, where traditional independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumptions may not hold. This is crucial for sensitive information in social and health sciences.

Method: The authors adapt Winsorized mean estimators for dependent data using a weak dependence notion formalized via log-Sobolev inequalities. They extend existing methods like stable histograms and randomized response histograms to provide guarantees under these conditions.

Result: They demonstrate how Winsorized mean estimators achieve strong performance for dependent data in both bounded and unbounded cases. Additionally, they extend these insights to applications such as random effects models and regression.

Conclusion: This research lays the groundwork for studying differential privacy in contexts with dependent data, broadening the scope and applicability of DP in statistical analyses.

Abstract: Dependent data underlies many statistical studies in the social and health sciences, which often involve sensitive or private information. Differential privacy (DP) and in particular \textit{user-level} DP provide a natural formalization of privacy requirements for processing dependent data where each individual provides multiple observations to the dataset. However, dependence introduced, e.g., through repeated measurements challenges the existing statistical theory under DP-constraints. In \iid{} settings, noisy Winsorized mean estimators have been shown to be minimax optimal for standard (\textit{item-level}) and \textit{user-level} DP estimation of a mean $μ\in \R^d$. Yet, their behavior on potentially dependent observations has not previously been studied. We fill this gap and show that Winsorized mean estimators can also be used under dependence for bounded and unbounded data, and can lead to asymptotic and finite sample guarantees that resemble their \iid{} counterparts under a weak notion of dependence. For this, we formalize dependence via log-Sobolev inequalities on the joint distribution of observations. This enables us to adapt the stable histogram by Karwa and Vadhan (2018) to a non-\iid{} setting, which we then use to estimate the private projection intervals of the Winsorized estimator. The resulting guarantees for our item-level mean estimator extend to \textit{user-level} mean estimation and transfer to the local model via a randomized response histogram. Using the mean estimators as building blocks, we provide extensions to random effects models, longitudinal linear regression and nonparametric regression. Therefore, our work constitutes a first step towards a systematic study of DP for dependent data.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates scaling laws in nonlinear regression with anisotropic data and develops a tractable reduction showing a three-phase learning trajectory. It derives explicit scaling laws for mean-squared error and confirms results with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how scaling laws manifest in nonlinear regression tasks with anisotropic data, and how anisotropy impacts learning dynamics.

Method: The authors analyze phase retrieval with anisotropic Gaussian inputs, utilizing a reduction to a hierarchical set of equations governing the system and deriving explicit scaling laws from this framework.

Result: A three-phase learning trajectory is uncovered: fast escape, slow convergence, and spectral-tail learning. Scaling laws for mean-squared error are derived and experimental results validate the theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: This study rigorously characterizes scaling laws in nonlinear regression with anisotropic data, demonstrating how anisotropy qualitatively alters learning dynamics.

Abstract: Scaling laws describe how learning performance improves with data, compute, or training time, and have become a central theme in modern deep learning. We study this phenomenon in a canonical nonlinear model: phase retrieval with anisotropic Gaussian inputs whose covariance spectrum follows a power law. Unlike the isotropic case, where dynamics collapse to a two-dimensional system, anisotropy yields a qualitatively new regime in which an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations governs the evolution of the summary statistics. We develop a tractable reduction that reveals a three-phase trajectory: (i) fast escape from low alignment, (ii) slow convergence of the summary statistics, and (iii) spectral-tail learning in low-variance directions. From this decomposition, we derive explicit scaling laws for the mean-squared error, showing how spectral decay dictates convergence times and error curves. Experiments confirm the predicted phases and exponents. These results provide the first rigorous characterization of scaling laws in nonlinear regression with anisotropic data, highlighting how anisotropy reshapes learning dynamics.

### [814] [On Instability of Minimax Optimal Optimism-Based Bandit Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18750)
*Samya Praharaj,Koulik Khamaru*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies the relationship between stability and minimax optimality in multi-armed bandit algorithms, showing that widely-used minimax-optimal algorithms fail stability criteria and questioning whether both traits can coexist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of ensuring statistical inference in adaptive multi-armed bandit algorithms, where the sample averages of rewards can fail to meet classical assumptions of asymptotic normality.

Method: The researchers analyze the stability properties of several widely-used minimax-optimal bandit algorithms and establish structural conditions under which they violate the Lai-Wei stability criterion. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are employed.

Result: They demonstrate that minimax-optimal bandit algorithms such as MOSS, ADA-UCB, KL-MOSS, and others fail to satisfy the stability criterion, preventing asymptotic normality of sample averages.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a fundamental tension between statistical stability and minimax optimal regret in bandit algorithms, suggesting that the coexistence of these properties remains an open research problem.

Abstract: Statistical inference from data generated by multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms is challenging due to their adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature. A classical manifestation is that sample averages of arm rewards under bandit sampling may fail to satisfy a central limit theorem. Lai and Wei's stability condition provides a sufficient, and essentially necessary criterion, for asymptotic normality in bandit problems. While the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm satisfies this stability condition, it is not minimax optimal, raising the question of whether minimax optimality and statistical stability can be achieved simultaneously. In this paper, we analyze the stability properties of a broad class of bandit algorithms that are based on the optimism principle. We establish general structural conditions under which such algorithms violate the Lai-Wei stability criterion. As a consequence, we show that widely used minimax-optimal UCB-style algorithms, including MOSS, Anytime-MOSS, Vanilla-MOSS, ADA-UCB, OC-UCB, KL-MOSS, KL-UCB++, KL-UCB-SWITCH, and Anytime KL-UCB-SWITCH, are unstable. We further complement our theoretical results with numerical simulations demonstrating that, in all these cases, the sample means fail to exhibit asymptotic normality.
  Overall, our findings suggest a fundamental tension between stability and minimax optimal regret, raising the question of whether it is possible to design bandit algorithms that achieve both. Understanding whether such simultaneously stable and minimax optimal strategies exist remains an important open direction.

*Sing-Yuan Yeh,Chun-Hao Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Predictive Topological Uncertainty (pTU) for Bayesian neural networks, analyzing uncertainty in model-input interactions and applying it for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability and statistical analysis of models by studying how they interact with input data, specifically addressing the problem of detecting out-of-distribution inputs that can lead to unreliable predictions.

Method: The authors propose a pTU measure to assess model interaction uncertainty and utilize it for OOD detection using a statistical significance test.

Result: It demonstrates the proposed approach's effectiveness across various experiments in terms of statistical power, sensitivity, and robustness.

Conclusion: pTU offers a robust, architecture-insensitive means to assess model reliability and addresses OOD detection challenges effectively.

Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) is a crucial concept in computational topology, providing a multiscale topological description of a space. It is particularly significant in topological data analysis, which aims to make statistical inference from a topological perspective. In this work, we introduce a new topological summary for Bayesian neural networks, termed the predictive topological uncertainty (pTU). The proposed pTU measures the uncertainty in the interaction between the model and the inputs. It provides insights from the model perspective: if two samples interact with a model in a similar way, then they are considered identically distributed. We also show that the pTU is insensitive to the model architecture. As an application, pTU is used to solve the out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, which is critical to ensure model reliability. Failure to detect OOD input can lead to incorrect and unreliable predictions. To address this issue, we propose a significance test for OOD based on the pTU, providing a statistical framework for this issue. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through various experiments, in terms of its statistical power, sensitivity, and robustness.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper develops DP2DP, an algorithm ensuring both differential privacy and demographic parity, challenging the notion that privacy compromises fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address fairness and privacy jointly in machine learning applications, as current research often treats them as conflicting goals.

Method: A postprocessing algorithm, DP2DP, is designed to integrate both differential privacy and demographic parity with minimal fairness impacts, supported by theoretical analysis.

Result: DP2DP demonstrates convergence on fairness objectives with comparable rates to non-private methods and achieves strong performance on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Differential privacy can coexist with fairness enhancement, achieving optimal accuracy/fairness/privacy balances using the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning in sensitive applications demands algorithms that simultaneously preserve data privacy and ensure fairness across potentially sensitive sub-populations. While privacy and fairness have each been extensively studied, their joint treatment remains poorly understood. Existing research often frames them as conflicting objectives, with multiple studies suggesting that strong privacy notions such as differential privacy inevitably compromise fairness. In this work, we challenge that perspective by showing that differential privacy can be integrated into a fairness-enhancing pipeline with minimal impact on fairness guarantees. We design a postprocessing algorithm, called DP2DP, that enforces both demographic parity and differential privacy. Our analysis reveals that our algorithm converges towards its demographic parity objective at essentially the same rate (up logarithmic factor) as the best non-private methods from the literature. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets confirm our theoretical results, showing that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy/fairness/privacy trade-offs.

*Zineddine Tighidet,Lazhar Labiod,Mohamed Nadif*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel algorithm combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm to address dimensionality and convergence issues in clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering models, particularly Gaussian models and the EM algorithm, face challenges with dimensionality and slow convergence. The study seeks to improve clustering efficiency while addressing these limitations.

Method: The algorithm integrates PCA for dimensionality reduction and CEM for faster clustering in a simultaneous, non-sequential approach.

Result: The proposed approach enhances both data embedding and clustering efficiency, with demonstrated benefits over existing methods.

Conclusion: The combination of PCA and CEM offers a practical solution to dimensionality and convergence issues in clustering, presenting connections with other clustering methodologies.

Abstract: The mixture model is undoubtedly one of the greatest contributions to clustering. For continuous data, Gaussian models are often used and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is particularly suitable for estimating parameters from which clustering is inferred. If these models are particularly popular in various domains including image clustering, they however suffer from the dimensionality and also from the slowness of convergence of the EM algorithm. However, the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm, a classifying version, offers a fast convergence solution while dimensionality reduction still remains a challenge. Thus we propose in this paper an algorithm combining simultaneously and non-sequentially the two tasks --Data embedding and Clustering-- relying on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and CEM. We demonstrate the interest of such approach in terms of clustering and data embedding. We also establish different connections with other clustering approaches.

*Emanuele Pardini,Katerina Papagiannouli*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cost-Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (CR-UOT) to address challenges in predefined ground transport cost for comparing data in heterogeneous spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitation of predefined ground transport cost in Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT), especially for datasets in heterogeneous spaces, and improve applications like single-cell omics profiling.

Method: The authors extend UOT by developing CR-UOT, which allows varying the ground cost while permitting mass creation/removal. They utilize entropic regularization and propose algorithms for CR-UOT.

Result: The proposed CR-UOT framework handles unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein type problems and achieves better alignment in heterogeneous single-cell omics profiles.

Conclusion: CR-UOT improves flexibility in data matching across Euclidean spaces and provides better results in cases where traditional UOT struggles, particularly in biological data applications.

Abstract: Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) provides a flexible way to match or compare nonnegative finite Radon measures. However, UOT requires a predefined ground transport cost, which may misrepresent the data's underlying geometry. Choosing such a cost is particularly challenging when datasets live in heterogeneous spaces, often motivating practitioners to adopt Gromov-Wasserstein formulations. To address this challenge, we introduce cost-regularized unbalanced optimal transport (CR-UOT), a framework that allows the ground cost to vary while allowing mass creation and removal. We show that CR-UOT incorporates unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein type problems through families of inner-product costs parameterized by linear transformations, enabling the matching of measures or point clouds across Euclidean spaces. We develop algorithms for such CR-UOT problems using entropic regularization and demonstrate that this approach improves the alignment of heterogeneous single-cell omics profiles, especially when many cells lack direct matches.

*Zikai Shen,Zonghao Chen,Dimitri Meunier,Ingo Steinwart,Arthur Gretton,Zhu Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses nonparametric instrumental variable regression with observed covariates (NPIV-O), which aids causal identification and heterogeneous effect estimation but is theoretically challenging due to partial identity structures and anisotropic smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance causal identification and heterogeneous causal effect estimation in NPIV by addressing challenges introduced by observed covariates, such as partial identity structures and anisotropic smoothness.

Method: The authors propose a novel Fourier measure for partial smoothing and adapt the kernel 2SLS instrumental variable (KIV-O) algorithm to incorporate Gaussian kernel lengthscales tailored to anisotropic smoothness.

Result: Proved upper $L^2$-learning rates and introduced first $L^2$-minimax lower rates for NPIV-O, identifying gaps in bounds linked to kernel lengthscale choices. These results also extend to proximal causal inference.

Conclusion: The framework bridges theoretical gaps in NPIV-O with observed covariates, advancing causal estimation methods and extending insights to proximal causal inference.

Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric instrumental variable regression with observed covariates, which we refer to as NPIV-O. Compared with standard nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV), the additional observed covariates facilitate causal identification and enables heterogeneous causal effect estimation. However, the presence of observed covariates introduces two challenges for its theoretical analysis. First, it induces a partial identity structure, which renders previous NPIV analyses - based on measures of ill-posedness, stability conditions, or link conditions - inapplicable. Second, it imposes anisotropic smoothness on the structural function. To address the first challenge, we introduce a novel Fourier measure of partial smoothing; for the second challenge, we extend the existing kernel 2SLS instrumental variable algorithm with observed covariates, termed KIV-O, to incorporate Gaussian kernel lengthscales adaptive to the anisotropic smoothness. We prove upper $L^2$-learning rates for KIV-O and the first $L^2$-minimax lower learning rates for NPIV-O. Both rates interpolate between known optimal rates of NPIV and nonparametric regression (NPR). Interestingly, we identify a gap between our upper and lower bounds, which arises from the choice of kernel lengthscales tuned to minimize a projected risk. Our theoretical analysis also applies to proximal causal inference, an emerging framework for causal effect estimation that shares the same conditional moment restriction as NPIV-O.

*Qifeng Hu,Inanc Senocak*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neural network-based, meshless method for solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, achieving high accuracy in challenging flow cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a computational method for solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in advection-dominated regimes efficiently and with high accuracy.

Method: A single neural network is used to parameterize velocity and pressure fields, minimizing residuals of a Poisson pressure equation with constraints from momentum and continuity equations, supported by Fourier feature mappings.

Result: The method achieves excellent agreement with benchmark solutions for high Reynolds number flows and laminar flows, demonstrating its reliability and accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the algorithmic advantages of using the Poisson's equation-centered formulation and neural networks, showing superior results for complex advection flows without relying on labeled data.

Abstract: We present a meshless method for the solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in advection-dominated regimes using physics- and equality-constrained artificial neural networks combined with a conditionally adaptive augmented Lagrangian formulation. A single neural network parameterizes both the velocity and pressure fields, and is trained by minimizing the residual of a Poisson's equation for pressure, constrained by the momentum and continuity equations, together with boundary conditions on the velocity field. No boundary conditions are imposed on the pressure field aside from anchoring the pressure at a point to prevent its unbounded development. The training is performed from scratch without labeled data, relying solely on the governing equations and constraints. To enhance accuracy in advection-dominated flows, we employ a single Fourier feature mapping of the input coordinates. The proposed method is demonstrated for the canonical lid-driven cavity flow up to a Reynolds number of 7,500 and for laminar flow over a circular cylinder with inflow-outflow boundary conditions, achieving excellent agreement with benchmark solutions. We further compare the present formulation against alternative objective-function constructions based on different arrangements of the flow equations, thereby highlighting the algorithmic advantages of the proposed formulation centered around the Poisson's equation for pressure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether time series foundation models can be effectively applied to noisy and heterogeneous financial data.

Method: It evaluates TSFMs through zero-shot inference, fine-tuning, and pre-training on large financial datasets, using benchmarks for comparison.

Result: Pre-trained TSFMs off-the-shelf perform poorly, but models pre-trained specifically on financial data achieve better forecasting accuracy and economic gains.

Conclusion: Domain-specific adaptation of TSFMs is crucial for achieving optimal performance in financial forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is central to trading, portfolio optimization, and risk management, yet it remains challenging due to noisy, non-stationary, and heterogeneous data. Recent advances in time series foundation models (TSFMs), inspired by large language models, offer a new paradigm for learning generalizable temporal representations from large and diverse datasets. This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of TSFMs in global financial markets. Using a large-scale dataset of daily excess returns across diverse markets, we evaluate zero-shot inference, fine-tuning, and pre-training from scratch against strong benchmark models. We find that off-the-shelf pre-trained TSFMs perform poorly in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, whereas models pre-trained from scratch on financial data achieve substantial forecasting and economic improvements, underscoring the value of domain-specific adaptation. Increasing the dataset size, incorporating synthetic data augmentation, and applying hyperparameter tuning further enhance performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Constructed Political Coordinates (CPC), a new embedding space to reduce political filter bubbles in news recommender systems (NRSs). The approach encourages bias diversity through collaborative filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this study is to address the unintended consequences of news recommender systems, specifically filter bubbles and political polarization, caused by biases in user reading history and topic coverage.

Method: The authors propose a novel CPC embedding space to model user political partisanship relative to broader populations. They use collaborative filtering (CF) with CPC-based correlations to recommend articles from users with opposing biases.

Result: The study finds that CPC-based methods promote bias diversity and align with users' true political tolerance better than classical collaborative filtering methods, which tend to perpetuate biases.

Conclusion: By leveraging CPC-based methods in news recommendation, it is possible to enhance political bias diversity, helping reduce filter bubbles and fostering a more politically tolerant information ecosystem.

Abstract: In the past two decades, open access to news and information has increased rapidly, empowering educated political growth within democratic societies. News recommender systems (NRSs) have shown to be useful in this process, minimizing political disengagement and information overload by providing individuals with articles on topics that matter to them. Unfortunately, NRSs often conflate underlying user interest with the partisan bias of the articles in their reading history and with the most popular biases present in the coverage of their favored topics. Over extended interaction, this can result in the formation of filter bubbles and the polarization of user partisanship. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding space called Constructed Political Coordinates (CPC), which models the political partisanship of users over a given topic-space, relative to a larger sample population. We apply a simple collaborative filtering (CF) framework using CPC-based correlation to recommend articles sourced from oppositional users, who have different biases from the user in question. We compare against classical CF methods and find that CPC-based methods promote pointed bias diversity and better match the true political tolerance of users, while classical methods implicitly exploit biases to maximize interaction.

*Ashley S. Dale,Kangming Li,Brian DeCost,Hao Wan,Yuchen Han,Yao Fehlis,Jason Hattrick-Simpers*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper evaluates uncertainty estimation methods for active learning in material discovery, focusing on how they impact model generalization to out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on addressing the critical role of uncertainty estimation in active learning for material discovery, aiming to enhance model learning and generalization to unseen data.

Method: Various uncertainty estimation methods and calibration approaches are compared using different model architectures (ALIGNN, XGBoost, Random Forests, and neural networks) for predicting solubility, bandgap, and formation energy. The methods are tested on their ability to generalize during active learning.

Result: Calibrated uncertainties struggle to outperform random sampling or uncalibrated uncertainties in reducing required data for model improvement on out-of-distribution data. Poor uncertainty estimates impact multiple models, indicating intrinsic challenges linked to data rather than just model capacity.

Conclusion: Uncertainty calibration approaches require further investigation, particularly to address issues related to empirical uncertainties in the feature input space and ensemble prediction variance limitations, to improve model generalization.

Abstract: Efficiently and meaningfully estimating prediction uncertainty is important for exploration in active learning campaigns in materials discovery, where samples with high uncertainty are interpreted as containing information missing from the model. In this work, the effect of different uncertainty estimation and calibration methods are evaluated for active learning when using ensembles of ALIGNN, eXtreme Gradient Boost, Random Forest, and Neural Network model architectures. We compare uncertainty estimates from ALIGNN deep ensembles to loss landscape uncertainty estimates obtained for solubility, bandgap, and formation energy prediction tasks. We then evaluate how the quality of the uncertainty estimate impacts an active learning campaign that seeks model generalization to out-of-distribution data. Uncertainty calibration methods were found to variably generalize from in-domain data to out-of-domain data. Furthermore, calibrated uncertainties were generally unsuccessful in reducing the amount of data required by a model to improve during an active learning campaign on out-of-distribution data when compared to random sampling and uncalibrated uncertainties. The impact of poor-quality uncertainty persists for random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models trained on the same data for the same tasks, indicating that this is at least partially intrinsic to the data and not due to model capacity alone. Analysis of the target, in-distribution uncertainty, out-of-distribution uncertainty, and training residual distributions suggest that future work focus on understanding empirical uncertainties in the feature input space for cases where ensemble prediction variances do not accurately capture the missing information required for the model to generalize.

Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of integrating computational predictions with experimental validation for high-entropy alloys, which have complex phase stability in vast compositional spaces.

Method: Introduces a confidence metric to quantify agreement between computational predictions (via DFT and CALPHAD) and experimental data from high-throughput synchrotron X-ray diffraction of FeNiMnCr alloy libraries.

Result: The methodology highlights agreements between predicted and observed phases, identifying strong correlations and discrepancies, particularly in FCC/BCC phase predictions in Mn-rich regions.

Conclusion: The integrated computational-experimental approach enhances model reliability, informs future refinements, and underscores discrepancies for targeted improvements in high-throughput alloy discovery.

Abstract: High-throughput methods enable accelerated discovery of novel materials in complex systems such as high-entropy alloys, which exhibit intricate phase stability across vast compositional spaces. Computational approaches, including Density Functional Theory (DFT) and calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD), facilitate screening of phase formability as a function of composition and temperature. However, the integration of computational predictions with experimental validation remains challenging in high-throughput studies. In this work, we introduce a quantitative confidence metric to assess the agreement between predictions and experimental observations, providing a quantitative measure of the confidence of machine learning models trained on either DFT or CALPHAD input in accounting for experimental evidence. The experimental dataset was generated via high-throughput in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction on compositionally varied FeNiMnCr alloy libraries, heated from room temperature to ~1000 °C. Agreement between the observed and predicted phases was evaluated using either temperature-independent phase classification or a model that incorporates a temperature-dependent probability of phase formation. This integrated approach demonstrates where strong overall agreement between computation and experiment exists, while also identifying key discrepancies, particularly in FCC/BCC predictions at Mn-rich regions to inform future model refinement.

Motivation: Discovering high-performance photosensitizers has faced challenges due to the inefficiency of traditional trial-and-error methods.

Conclusion: This workflow accelerates innovation in photosensitizer design and holds promise for advancing applications such as photodynamic therapy.

Abstract: The discovery of high-performance photosensitizers has long been hindered by the time-consuming and resource-intensive nature of traditional trial-and-error approaches. Here, we present \textbf{A}I-\textbf{A}ccelerated \textbf{P}hoto\textbf{S}ensitizer \textbf{I}nnovation (AAPSI), a closed-loop workflow that integrates expert knowledge, scaffold-based molecule generation, and Bayesian optimization to accelerate the design of novel photosensitizers. The scaffold-driven generation in AAPSI ensures structural novelty and synthetic feasibility, while the iterative AI-experiment loop accelerates the discovery of novel photosensitizers. AAPSI leverages a curated database of 102,534 photosensitizer-solvent pairs and generate 6,148 synthetically accessible candidates. These candidates are screened via graph transformers trained to predict singlet oxygen quantum yield ($φ_Δ$) and absorption maxima ($λ_{max}$), following experimental validation. This work generates several novel candidates for photodynamic therapy (PDT), among which the hypocrellin-based candidate HB4Ph exhibits exceptional performance at the Pareto frontier of high quantum yield of singlet oxygen and long absorption maxima among current photosensitizers ($φ_Δ$=0.85, $λ_{max}$=650nm).

TL;DR: DKAN is a novel model for predicting spatial gene expression that addresses current limitations by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles with biologically informed methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in predicting spatial gene expression from whole slide images, such as lack of biological context usage, reliance on exemplar retrieval, and poor multi-modal alignment.

Method: The paper proposes DKAN, a model with a gene semantic representation module using external gene databases, a unified learning paradigm combining contrastive learning and supervised learning, and a dual-path module for effective feature integration.

Result: DKAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial gene expression prediction across three public ST datasets.

Conclusion: DKAN establishes a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and serves as an effective tool for advancing biological and clinical research.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a technology that measures gene expression profiles within tissue sections while retaining spatial context. It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.

By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function. In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications near [Fe--S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction of the time.

### [832] [SYNAPSE: Synergizing an Adapter and Finetuning for High-Fidelity EEG Synthesis from a CLIP-Aligned Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17547)
*Jeyoung Lee,Hochul Kang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes SYNAPSE, a framework for generating images from EEG signals, focusing on semantic representation and image quality using lightweight models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance understanding of human perception and mental representation by generating images from noisy and variable EEG signals, overcoming the limitations of current models.

Method: SYNAPSE employs a two-stage framework: Stage 1 uses a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder for latent representation learning, while Stage 2 integrates this with a streamlined Stable Diffusion for efficient EEG-based image synthesis.

Result: SYNAPSE achieves state-of-the-art results for perceptual fidelity and effectiveness in EEG-to-image tasks on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: Generalizing EEG signals to image synthesis requires capturing perceptions rather than classifications, which SYNAPSE achieves effectively with minimal training overhead.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based generative models has enabled high-quality image synthesis conditioned on diverse modalities. Extending such models to brain signals could deepen our understanding of human perception and mental representations. However,electroencephalography (EEG) presents major challenges for image generation due to high noise, low spatial resolution, and strong inter-subject variability. Existing approaches,such as DreamDiffusion, BrainVis, and GWIT, primarily adapt EEG features to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models using complex alignment or classification pipelines, often resulting in large parameter counts and limited interpretability. We introduce SYNAPSE, a two-stage framework that bridges EEG signal representation learning and high-fidelity image synthesis. In Stage1, a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder learns a semantically structured latent representation by combining signal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. In Stage2, the pretrained encoder is frozen and integrated with a lightweight adaptation of Stable Diffusion, enabling efficient conditioning on EEG features with minimal trainable parameters. Our method achieves a semantically coherent latent space and state-of-the-art perceptual fidelity on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming prior EEG-to-image models in both reconstruction efficiency and image quality. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that SYNAPSE generalizes effectively across subjects, preserving visual semantics even when class-level agreement is reduced. These results suggest that reconstructing what the brain perceives, rather than what it classifies, is key to faithful EEG-based image generation.

*Chunlei Shi,Han Xu,Yinghao Li,Yi-Lin Wei,Yongchao Feng,Yecheng Zhang,Dan Niu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: WaveC2R uses a wavelet-driven method to improve radar retrieval by integrating multi-source data and analyzing frequency components to handle meteorological complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radar retrieval methods often rely on simplified spatial-domain models, which limit their accuracy in capturing precipitation patterns and sharp meteorological boundaries.

Method: WaveC2R employs a two-stage wavelet-driven approach: decoupled learning of intensity-boundary components and detail-enhanced refinement using frequency-aware priors and multi-source inputs.

Result: WaveC2R, tested on SEVIR dataset, outperformed current methods in radar retrieval with improvements in high-intensity precipitation and sharp boundary preservation.

Conclusion: WaveC2R provides a significant advancement in satellite-based radar retrieval, enhancing the ability to model complex meteorological structures and improving accuracy using frequency-domain techniques.

Abstract: Satellite-based radar retrieval methods are widely employed to fill coverage gaps in ground-based radar systems, especially in remote areas affected by terrain blockage and limited detection range. Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency. Experimental results on the publicly available SEVIR dataset demonstrate that WaveC2R achieves state-of-the-art performance in satellite-based radar retrieval, particularly excelling at preserving high-intensity precipitation features and sharply defined meteorological boundaries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing training overhead and computational complexity for precise mmWave beam alignments in position-assisted beam prediction for 6G networks.

Method: The paper proposes a three-layer undercomplete autoencoder (LAE) to leverage dimensionality reduction for efficient position-assisted beam prediction.

Result: Simulation results indicate the LAE achieves comparable beam prediction accuracy to conventional deep fully connected neural networks with significantly reduced complexity.

Conclusion: The LAE model is an effective and computationally efficient approach for position-assisted beam prediction in mmWave 6G networks.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication and millimeter wave (mmWave) have emerged as pivotal technologies for 6G networks. However, the narrow nature of mmWave beams requires precise alignments that typically necessitate large training overhead. This overhead can be reduced by incorporating the position information with beam adjustments. This letter proposes a lightweight autorencoder (LAE) model that addresses the position-assisted beam prediction problem while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to the conventional baseline method, i.e., deep fully connected neural network. The proposed LAE is designed as a three-layer undercomplete network to exploit its dimensionality reduction capabilities and thereby mitigate the computational requirements of the trained model. Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves a similar beam prediction accuracy to the baseline with an 83% complexity reduction.

*Kexin Li,Mandar Chitre*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: StableUASim is a generative model for underwater acoustic channels, addressing challenges in modeling by using a pre-trained latent diffusion approach for statistical realism and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of conventional physics-based and stochastic replay models in capturing diverse, unseen scenarios in underwater acoustic channels, which are needed for designing reliable communication systems.

Method: The authors propose a pre-trained conditional latent diffusion surrogate model named StableUASim, leveraging generative model techniques for diverse and realistic channel simulation. It includes adaptation using minimal additional data and efficient analysis through latent representation.

Result: StableUASim demonstrated its capability to reproduce key channel characteristics and supporting communication performance effectively, offering a scalable and data-efficient model.

Conclusion: StableUASim provides a robust surrogate modeling approach for underwater communication system design and machine learning applications, balancing statistical realism and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of time-varying underwater acoustic channels is essential for the design, evaluation, and deployment of reliable underwater communication systems. Conventional physics models require detailed environmental knowledge, while stochastic replay methods are constrained by the limited diversity of measured channels and often fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, reducing their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose StableUASim, a pre-trained conditional latent diffusion surrogate model that captures the stochastic dynamics of underwater acoustic communication channels. Leveraging generative modeling, StableUASim produces diverse and statistically realistic channel realizations, while supporting conditional generation from specific measurement samples. Pre-training enables rapid adaptation to new environments using minimal additional data, and the autoencoder latent representation facilitates efficient channel analysis and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that StableUASim accurately reproduces key channel characteristics and communication performance, providing a scalable, data-efficient, and physically consistent surrogate model for both system design and machine learning-driven underwater applications.

### [836] [NSTR: Neural Spectral Transport Representation for Space-Varying Frequency Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18384)
*Plein Versace*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Spectral Transport Representation (NSTR), a novel implicit neural representation (INR) framework addressing spectral nonstationarity in real-world signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current INRs assume globally stationary spectra, which misaligns with real-world signals that have varying frequency characteristics across space.

Method: NSTR explicitly models a spatially varying local frequency field using a learnable frequency transport equation to govern spectral compositions across spatial regions.

Result: NSTR outperforms existing methods like SIREN and Instant-NGP, showing better accuracy, faster convergence, fewer global frequencies, and enhanced interpretability in image, audio, and 3D geometry tasks.

Conclusion: NSTR introduces a paradigm shift in INR research, bringing explicit modeling of space-variable spectra and better adaptability and visual interpretability.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing signals such as images, audio, and 3D scenes. However, existing INR frameworks -- including MLPs with Fourier features, SIREN, and multiresolution hash grids -- implicitly assume a \textit{global and stationary} spectral basis. This assumption is fundamentally misaligned with real-world signals whose frequency characteristics vary significantly across space, exhibiting local high-frequency textures, smooth regions, and frequency drift phenomena. We propose \textbf{Neural Spectral Transport Representation (NSTR)}, the first INR framework that \textbf{explicitly models a spatially varying local frequency field}. NSTR introduces a learnable \emph{frequency transport equation}, a PDE that governs how local spectral compositions evolve across space. Given a learnable local spectrum field $S(x)$ and a frequency transport network $F_θ$ enforcing $\nabla S(x) \approx F_θ(x, S(x))$, NSTR reconstructs signals by spatially modulating a compact set of global sinusoidal bases. This formulation enables strong local adaptivity and offers a new level of interpretability via visualizing frequency flows. Experiments on 2D image regression, audio reconstruction, and implicit 3D geometry show that NSTR achieves significantly better accuracy-parameter trade-offs than SIREN, Fourier-feature MLPs, and Instant-NGP. NSTR requires fewer global frequencies, converges faster, and naturally explains signal structure through spectral transport fields. We believe NSTR opens a new direction in INR research by introducing explicit modeling of space-varying spectrum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a fair and reproducible benchmark for assessing TTA algorithms in audio classifiers, addressing the challenges posed by realistic, dynamic, and heterogeneous acoustic conditions.

Method: The method involves constructing four standardized benchmarks (UrbanSound8K-C, SpeechCommandsV2-C, VocalSound-C, ReefSet-C) with dynamic corruption levels and diverse noise types, alongside developing comprehensive evaluation criteria.

Result: DHAuDS enables fair and reproducible evaluations with 50 unique criteria across 124 experiments, fostering robust comparison of TTA algorithms under mixed-domain shifts.

Conclusion: DHAuDS provides a realistic testbed for studying robust and adaptive audio modeling, supporting advancements in handling real-world domain shifts effectively.

Abstract: Audio classifiers frequently face domain shift, when models trained on one dataset lose accuracy on data recorded in acoustically different conditions. Previous Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) research in speech and sound analysis often evaluates models under fixed or mismatched noise settings, that fail to mimic real-world variability. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents DHAuDS (Dynamic and Heterogeneous Audio Domain Shift), a benchmark designed to assess TTA approaches under more realistic and diverse acoustic shifts. DHAuDS comprises four standardized benchmarks: UrbanSound8K-C, SpeechCommandsV2-C, VocalSound-C, and ReefSet-C, each constructed with dynamic corruption severity levels and heterogeneous noise types to simulate authentic audio degradation scenarios. The framework defines 14 evaluation criteria for each benchmark (8 for UrbanSound8K-C), resulting in 50 unrepeated criteria (124 experiments) that collectively enable fair, reproducible, and cross-domain comparison of TTA algorithms. Through the inclusion of dynamic and mixed-domain noise settings, DHAuDS offers a consistent and publicly reproducible testbed to support ongoing studies in robust and adaptive audio modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for creating bird soundscapes often involve either single-species focus, static calls, or reliance on recordings and data, facing challenges like noise, inflexibility, and high data needs. The paper aims to create a more flexible, robust method without these constraints.

Method: The authors developed a DSP-based algorithmic framework to simulate dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes. It generates chirps, overlapping calls, and species-specific acoustic patterns, integrating 3D spatialization for realistic inter-bird dynamics and provides a visualization interface for analytical purposes.

Result: The system successfully produces immersive, scalable, and ecologically inspired bird soundscapes with controllable chirp sequences and overlapping choruses. Visual and audio evaluations confirm the system’s capability.

Conclusion: This framework advances the field of computer music, virtual environments, and bioacoustics by demonstrating a novel and flexible approach to generating precise and realistic multi-species bird soundscapes.

Abstract: Generation of dynamic, scalable multi-species bird soundscapes remains a significant challenge in computer music and algorithmic sound design. Birdsongs involve rapid frequency-modulated chirps, complex amplitude envelopes, distinctive acoustic patterns, overlapping calls, and dynamic inter-bird interactions, all of which require precise temporal and spatial control in 3D environments. Existing approaches, whether Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-based or data-driven, typically focus only on single species modeling, static call structures, or synthesis directly from recordings, and often suffer from noise, limited flexibility, or large data needs. To address these challenges, we present a novel, fully algorithm-driven framework that generates dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes using DSP-based chirp generation and 3D spatialization, without relying on recordings or training data. Our approach simulates multiple independently-moving birds per species along different moving 3D trajectories, supporting controllable chirp sequences, overlapping choruses, and realistic 3D motion in scalable soundscapes while preserving species-specific acoustic patterns. A visualization interface provides bird trajectories, spectrograms, activity timelines, and sound waves for analytical and creative purposes. Both visual and audio evaluations demonstrate the ability of the system to generate dense, immersive, and ecologically inspired soundscapes, highlighting its potential for computer music, interactive virtual environments, and computational bioacoustics research.

Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of explicitly controlling compositional features like tonal tension in symbolic music generation, which remains difficult despite advancements in music generation models.

Method: A computational tonal tension model is incorporated into a Transformer framework, and a two-level beam search strategy is adopted during inference. Token-level re-ranking optimizes model probability and diversity, while bar-level re-ranking ensures alignment with a desired tension curve.

Result: Objective evaluations show successful modulation of tonal tension, and subjective listening tests confirm that the system aligns with target tension. Additionally, the method can generate distinct musical interpretations under the same tension condition.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an intuitive way to condition AI-generated music on tonal tension, demonstrating both effective modulation and versatility in generating varied musical outputs.

Abstract: State-of-the-art symbolic music generation models have recently achieved remarkable output quality, yet explicit control over compositional features, such as tonal tension, remains challenging. We propose a novel approach that integrates a computational tonal tension model, based on tonal interval vector analysis, into a Transformer framework. Our method employs a two-level beam search strategy during inference. At the token level, generated candidates are re-ranked using model probability and diversity metrics to maintain overall quality. At the bar level, a tension-based re-ranking is applied to ensure that the generated music aligns with a desired tension curve. Objective evaluations indicate that our approach effectively modulates tonal tension, and subjective listening tests confirm that the system produces outputs that align with the target tension. These results demonstrate that explicit tension conditioning through a dual-level beam search provides a powerful and intuitive tool to guide AI-generated music. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that our method can generate multiple distinct musical interpretations under the same tension condition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation struggle with balancing semantic, temporal, aesthetic, and spatial dimensions due to single-loss function entanglement and lack of alignment with human preferences.

Method: PrismAudio employs a novel approach using Chain-of-Thought reasoning with four specialized modules and targeted reward functions, optimized with Fast-GRPO, a computationally efficient ODE-SDE hybrid sampling method.

Result: PrismAudio surpasses prior methods in V2A generation across all four perceptual dimensions on VGGSound and the newly proposed AudioCanvas benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: PrismAudio effectively resolves the challenges of objective entanglement and computational efficiency, setting a new standard in multimodal audio synthesis.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation requires balancing four critical perceptual dimensions: semantic consistency, audio-visual temporal synchrony, aesthetic quality, and spatial accuracy; yet existing methods suffer from objective entanglement that conflates competing goals in single loss functions and lack human preference alignment. We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples. Experimental results demonstrate that PrismAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four perceptual dimensions on both the in-domain VGGSound test set and out-of-domain AudioCanvas benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based CA2C method, along with the reward function, successfully handles optimal resource allocation for carrier aggregation while mitigating effects of self-interference in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Carrier aggregation (CA) is a technique that allows mobile networks to combine multiple carriers to increase user data rate. On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI.

*Jianfeng Xu,Zeyan Li*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework to quantify the trade-offs between storage and computational efficiency, introducing 'Derivation Entropy' to measure computation's thermodynamic costs, and identifying a critical transition point favoring either retrieval or generative computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify physical (thermodynamic) principles with computational and storage challenges in AI systems, addressing inefficiencies and limitations in current models.

Method: Introduced 'Derivation Entropy' as a metric; analyzed the interaction of Shannon entropy and computational complexity to identify phase transitions; framed computational strategies within a thermodynamic perspective.

Result: Revealed a critical phase transition, where retrieval or generative computation becomes preferable, depending on energy/time/storage trade-offs; formulated a theoretical conservation law ('Energy-Time-Space').

Conclusion: Minimizing Derivation Entropy is crucial for designing efficient AI and understanding intelligence's evolution, impacting future AI architecture development.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This "Energy-Time-Space" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.

*Akashdeep Saha,Zeng Wang,Prithwish Basu Roy,Johann Knechtel,Ozgur Sinanoglu,Ramesh Karri*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LockForge is a framework that converts logic locking descriptions from papers into executable code using multi-agent large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility in logic locking research is hindered by the lack of public code implementations.

Method: LockForge uses a multi-agent LLM framework with iterative refinement, validation stages, and advanced reasoning models to generate and test code implementations.

Result: LockForge successfully generates implementations for 10 logic locking schemes, including those without reference codes, demonstrating the framework's capability and complexity.

Conclusion: LockForge bridges the gap between logic locking descriptions and practice, promoting reproducibility and providing tools for further LL research evaluation.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in logic locking (LL), reproducibility remains a challenge as codes are rarely made public. We present LockForge, a first-of-its-kind, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework that turns LL descriptions in papers into executable and tested code. LockForge provides a carefully crafted pipeline realizing forethought, implementation, iterative refinement, and a multi-stage validation, all to systematically bridge the gap between prose and practice for complex LL schemes. For validation, we devise (i) an LLM-as-Judge stage with a scoring system considering behavioral checks, conceptual mechanisms, structural elements, and reproducibility on benchmarks, and (ii) an independent LLM-as-Examiner stage for ground-truth assessment. We apply LockForge to 10 seminal LL schemes, many of which lack reference implementations. Our evaluation on multiple SOTA LLMs, including ablation studies, reveals the significant complexity of the task. We show that an advanced reasoning model and a sophisticated, multi-stage framework like LockForge are required. We release all implementations and benchmarks, providing a reproducible and fair foundation for evaluation of further LL research.

### [847] [Pre-cache: A Microarchitectural Solution to prevent Meltdown and Spectre](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17726)
*Subhash Sethumurugan,Hari Cherupalli,Kangjie Lu,John Sartori*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in microprocessors caused by side-channel attacks (Meltdown and Spectre) and proposes a microarchitecture-based solution with low performance overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern processors' performance-enhancing features are exploited by attacks like Meltdown and Spectre, exposing secret data through side channels.

Method: Develop a microarchitecture-based solution that prevents flushed instructions from exposing data to the cache and extends the approach to other memory structures.

Result: The solution restores secure speculative and out-of-order execution, prevents variants of attacks, and maintains low performance overhead.

Conclusion: This microarchitecture-based approach effectively mitigates vulnerabilities exploited by side-channel attacks, providing secure execution with minimal impact on performance.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that out-of-order and speculative execution mechanisms used to increase performance in the majority of processors expose the processors to critical attacks. These attacks, called Meltdown and Spectre, exploit the side effects of performance-enhancing features in modern microprocessors to expose secret data through side channels in the microarchitecture. The well known implementations of these attacks exploit cache-based side channels since they are the least noisy channels to exfiltrate data. While some software patches attempted to mitigate these attacks, they are ad-hoc and only try to fix the side effects of the vulnerabilites. They may also impose a performance overhead of up to 30%. In this paper, we present a microarchitecture-based solution for Meltdown and Spectre that addresses the vulnerabilities exploited by the attacks. Our solution prevents flushed instructions from exposing data to the cache. Our approach can also be extended to other memory structures in the microarchitecture thereby preventing variants of the attacks which exploit these memory structures. We further identify two new variant attacks based on exploiting the side effects of speculative and out-of-order execution and show how our solution can be used to prevent these attacks. Evaluation results show that our microarchitectural solution not only restores secure out-of-order and speculative execution, but also has relatively low overhead and does not significantly impact performance for most applications.

*Dilli Babu Porlapothula,Pralay Chakrabarty,Ananya Lakshmi Ravi,Kurian Polachan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ioPUF+, a novel PUF-based solution for IC and IoT authentication, showcasing high reliability, uniqueness, and efficiency using existing components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Secure device identification and communication is critical in IoT systems, but integration of cryptographic hardware is challenging and costly.

Method: ioPUF+ leverages pull-up/pull-down resistor variations existing on IC I/O pins, incorporating BCH error correction, SHA-256 hashing, and AES encryption for key generation and communication.

Result: Evaluation across 30 devices reports excellent reliability (100% intra-distance), uniqueness (50.33% inter-distance), and stability with low error rates under varying environmental conditions.

Conclusion: ioPUF+ offers a cost-effective, reliable, and energy-efficient solution for authentication and encryption in resource-constrained IoT systems.

Abstract: In this work, we present ioPUF+, which incorporates a novel Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) that generates unique fingerprints for Integrated Circuits (ICs) and the IoT nodes encompassing them. The proposed PUF generates device-specific responses by measuring the pull-up and pull-down resistor values on the I/O pins of the ICs, which naturally vary across chips due to manufacturing-induced process variations. Since these resistors are already integrated into the I/O structures of most ICs, ioPUF+ requires no custom circuitry, and no new IC fabrication. This makes ioPUF+ suitable for cost-sensitive embedded systems built from Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. Beyond introducing a new PUF, ioPUF+ includes a complete datapath for converting raw PUF responses into cryptographically usable secret keys using BCH error correction and SHA-256 hashing. Further ioPUF+ also demonstrate a practical use case of PUF derive secret keys in securing device-to-device communication using AES-encryption. We implemented ioPUF+ on the Infineon PSoC-5 microcontroller and evaluated its performance across 30 devices using standard PUF metrics. The results show excellent reliability (intra-device Hamming distance of 100.00%), strong uniqueness (inter-device Hamming distance of 50.33%), near-ideal uniformity (50.54%), and negligible bit aliasing. Stability tests under temperature and supply-voltage variations show worst-case bit-error rates of only 2.63% and 2.10%, respectively. We also profiled the resource and energy usage of the complete ioPUF+ system, including the PUF primitive, BCH decoding, SHA-256 hashing, and AES encryption. The full implementation requires only 19.8 KB of Flash, exhibits a latency of 600 ms, and consumes 79 mW of power, demonstrating the suitabilitiy of ioPUF+ for resource-constrained IoT nodes.

*Xiangrui Zhang,Zeyu Chen,Haining Wang,Qiang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FIRMHIVE is proposed as a framework for LLMs to better analyze firmware security, marking substantial improvements in vulnerability detection compared to existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to improve the underperformance of Large Language Models in firmware security analysis due to binary formats, dependency complexity, and diverse component structures.

Method: The paper introduces FIRMHIVE, a recursive agent system that enables decentralized coordination through delegation mechanisms and runtime Tree of Agents (ToA).

Result: FIRMHIVE outperforms baseline LLM-agents with 16x deeper reasoning, 2.3x broader file inspection, and identifies 5.6x more alerts. It also surpasses SOTA tools by finding 1.5x more vulnerabilities with 71% precision.

Conclusion: FIRMHIVE demonstrates that LLMs can achieve better yield and accuracy for automated firmware vulnerability detection and presents a significant step forward for security analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agent systems have recently demonstrated strong potential in automating code reasoning and vulnerability detection. However, when applied to large-scale firmware, their performance degrades due to the binary nature of firmware, complex dependency structures, and heterogeneous components. To address this challenge, this paper presents FIRMHIVE, a recursive agent hive that enables LLMs to act as autonomous firmware security analysts. FIRMHIVE introduces two key mechanisms: (1) transforming delegation into a per-agent, executable primitive and (2) constructing a runtime Tree of Agents (ToA) for decentralized coordination. We evaluate FIRMHIVE using real-world firmware images obtained from publicly available datasets, covering five representative security analysis tasks. Compared with existing LLM-agent baselines, FIRMHIVE performs deeper (about 16x more reasoning steps) and broader (about 2.3x more files inspected) cross-file exploration, resulting in about 5.6x more alerts per firmware. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) security tools, FIRMHIVE identifies about 1.5x more vulnerabilities (1,802 total) and achieves 71% precision, representing significant improvements in both yield and fidelity.

*Atharv Singh Patlan,Peiyao Sheng,S. Ashwin Hebbar,Prateek Mittal,Pramod Viswanath*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses cross-user poisoning (CUP), a vulnerability in multi-user language agents where adversarial messages can poison shared state and cause unintended actions. It validates CUP attacks, introduces a study framework, and proposes a defense using task-based clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As language agents evolve from single-user assistants to multi-user collaborators, there is a critical need to address vulnerabilities in handling interactions and tasks within shared workspaces.

Method: The researchers validated CUP attacks on existing systems and developed MURMUR, a systematic framework using LLMs to simulate realistic multi-user scenarios and assess CUP risks. They also proposed a defense mechanism based on task-based clustering.

Result: CUP attacks have high success rates and can persist across various tasks. MURMUR provided insights into multi-user scenarios and underscored fundamental risks in deploying multi-user language agents.

Conclusion: The study highlights the pressing need to address CUP vulnerabilities in multi-user LLM systems. Task-based clustering offers a preliminary defense, but more comprehensive solutions are necessary to ensure secure deployments.

Abstract: Language agents are rapidly expanding from single-user assistants to multi-user collaborators in shared workspaces and groups. However, today's language models lack a mechanism for isolating user interactions and concurrent tasks, creating a new attack vector inherent to this new setting: cross-user poisoning (CUP). In a CUP attack, an adversary injects ordinary-looking messages that poison the persistent, shared state, which later triggers the agent to execute unintended, attacker-specified actions on behalf of benign users. We validate CUP on real systems, successfully attacking popular multi-user agents. To study the phenomenon systematically, we present MURMUR, a framework that composes single-user tasks into concurrent, group-based scenarios using an LLM to generate realistic, history-aware user interactions. We observe that CUP attacks succeed at high rates and their effects persist across multiple tasks, thus posing fundamental risks to multi-user LLM deployments. Finally, we introduce a first-step defense with task-based clustering to mitigate this new class of vulnerability

*Xiaoqing Wang,Keman Huang,Bin Liang,Hongyu Li,Xiaoyong Du*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems, introduces an attack methodology (IMBIA), proposes a defense mechanism (Adv-IMBIA), and emphasizes the need for robust security protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the largely unexplored security risks in LLM-driven multi-agent systems, particularly when democratizing software development introduces threats from malicious or compromised agents.

Method: The authors identify scenarios such as MU-BA and BU-MA, introduce IMBIA as an attack demonstrating hidden malicious code generation, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a counter-defense mechanism.

Result: IMBIA achieved attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% (MU-BA) and 71%, 84%, and 45% (BU-MA) in different frameworks. Adv-IMBIA significantly reduced success rates, especially in MU-BA. Coding/testing stage agents were found to pose higher risks.

Conclusion: Robust security measures are critical to protect against threats in multi-agent LLM-based software development systems, with practical defenses targeting critical stages and agents being pivotal.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems has significantly streamlined software developing tasks, enabling users with little technical expertise to develop executable applications. While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.

*Junbo Zhang,Ran Chen,Qianli Zhou,Xinyang Deng,Wen Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents MOSR, a method to tackle over-refusal in large language models (LLMs) while maintaining safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of over-refusal in LLM safety defenses, which excessively reject tasks, reducing usability.

Method: MOSR involves Overlap-Aware Loss Weighting to adjust malicious sample erasure based on representation similarity and Context-Aware Augmentation to provide needed context for rejection decisions.

Result: The experiments show MOSR successfully reduces over-refusal while largely maintaining safety, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Future defense strategies in LLMs should balance safety with usability, avoiding extreme over-refusals.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate powerful capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet they also harbor safety vulnerabilities. To enhance LLM safety, various jailbreak defense methods have been proposed to guard against harmful outputs. However, improvements in model safety often come at the cost of severe over-refusal, failing to strike a good balance between safety and usability. In this paper, we first analyze the causes of over-refusal from a representation perspective, revealing that over-refusal samples reside at the boundary between benign and malicious samples. Based on this, we propose MOSR, designed to mitigate over-refusal by intervening the safety representation of LLMs. MOSR incorporates two novel components: (1) Overlap-Aware Loss Weighting, which determines the erasure weight for malicious samples by quantifying their similarity to pseudo-malicious samples in the representation space, and (2) Context-Aware Augmentation, which supplements the necessary context for rejection decisions by adding harmful prefixes before rejection responses. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in mitigating over-refusal while largely maintaining safety. Overall, we advocate that future defense methods should strike a better balance between safety and over-refusal.

*Tom Perel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines the vulnerabilities of two prominent LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4o mini) to jailbreak attacks using various strategies and methods, revealing disparities in their safety measures and highlighting their susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing integration of LLMs in various applications and the need to understand and improve their security and safety mechanisms.

Method: The researchers analyzed two LLMs using self-bypass and cross-bypass attack strategies with four attack types (direct injection, role-playing, context manipulation, and obfuscation) to create disallowed content in five categories.

Result: Findings showed that the two models differ in their susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, exposing significant vulnerabilities in their architecture, especially in cross-bypass attacks.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for automated AI red-teaming while suggesting that balancing model functionality with safety remains a considerable challenge.

Abstract: The recent boom and rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a wide range of applications warrants a deeper understanding of their security and safety vulnerabilities. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks for two leading publicly available LLMs, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and OpenAI's GPT-4 (specifically the GPT-4o mini model accessible in the free tier). The research utilized two main bypass strategies: 'self-bypass', where models were prompted to circumvent their own safety protocols, and 'cross-bypass', where one model generated adversarial prompts to exploit vulnerabilities in the other. Four attack methods were employed - direct injection, role-playing, context manipulation, and obfuscation - to generate five distinct categories of unsafe content: hate speech, illegal activities, malicious code, dangerous content, and misinformation. The success of the attack was determined by the generation of disallowed content, with successful jailbreaks assigned a severity score. The findings indicate a disparity in jailbreak susceptibility between 2.5 Flash and GPT-4, suggesting variations in their safety implementations or architectural design. Cross-bypass attacks were particularly effective, indicating that an ample amount of vulnerabilities exist in the underlying transformer architecture. This research contributes a scalable framework for automated AI red-teaming and provides data-driven insights into the current state of LLM safety, underscoring the complex challenge of balancing model capabilities with robust safety mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes an automated permission management system for AI agents, identifying user preferences via a study and achieving high predictive accuracy with their model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the transparency and control issues raised by AI agents acting autonomously on behalf of users.

Method: Conducting a user study to understand permission decisions and using machine learning to predict user preferences for permission management.

Result: Developed a model achieving 85.1% overall accuracy and 94.4% high-confidence predictions; minimal training samples significantly boosted prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Automated permission prediction for AI agents is feasible and effective, with robust predictive ability even without extensive user history.

Abstract: As AI agents attempt to autonomously act on users' behalf, they raise transparency and control issues. We argue that permission-based access control is indispensable in providing meaningful control to the users, but conventional permission models are inadequate for the automated agentic execution paradigm. We therefore propose automated permission management for AI agents. Our key idea is to conduct a user study to identify the factors influencing users' permission decisions and to encode these factors into an ML-based permission management assistant capable of predicting users' future decisions. We find that participants' permission decisions are influenced by communication context but importantly individual preferences tend to remain consistent within contexts, and align with those of other participants. Leveraging these insights, we develop a permission prediction model achieving 85.1% accuracy overall and 94.4% for high-confidence predictions. We find that even without using permission history, our model achieves an accuracy of 66.9%, and a slight increase of training samples (i.e., 1-4) can substantially increase the accuracy by 10.8%.

### [855] [Towards Effective, Stealthy, and Persistent Backdoor Attacks Targeting Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17982)
*Jiayi Luo,Qingyun Sun,Lingjuan Lyu,Ziwei Zhang,Haonan Yuan,Xingcheng Fu,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the vulnerability of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) to backdoor attacks, proposing a model called GFM-BA to effectively, stealthily, and persistently compromise them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the security vulnerabilities in GFMs against backdoor attacks, which are underexplored yet critical as compromised GFMs can pose severe security risks in downstream graph learning applications.

Method: The approach involves three modules: a label-free trigger association module to link triggers independent of downstream tasks, a node-adaptive trigger generator for stealthy and effective trigger generation, and a backdoor anchoring module to ensure attack persistence throughout fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments confirm that the proposed GFM-BA is effective at inducing backdoor behaviors, remains stealthy across domains, and ensures backdoor persistence after downstream adaptation.

Conclusion: GFM-BA successfully demonstrates how backdoor attacks can exploit vulnerabilities in GFMs, emphasizing the importance of investigating such attack strategies for enhancing security measures.

Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) are pre-trained on diverse source domains and adapted to unseen targets, enabling broad generalization for graph machine learning. Despite that GFMs have attracted considerable attention recently, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. A compromised GFM can introduce backdoor behaviors into downstream applications, posing serious security risks. However, launching backdoor attacks against GFMs is non-trivial due to three key challenges. (1) Effectiveness: Attackers lack knowledge of the downstream task during pre-training, complicating the assurance that triggers reliably induce misclassifications into desired classes. (2) Stealthiness: The variability in node features across domains complicates trigger insertion that remains stealthy. (3) Persistence: Downstream fine-tuning may erase backdoor behaviors by updating model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose GFM-BA, a novel Backdoor Attack model against Graph Foundation Models. Specifically, we first design a label-free trigger association module that links the trigger to a set of prototype embeddings, eliminating the need for knowledge about downstream tasks to perform backdoor injection. Then, we introduce a node-adaptive trigger generator, dynamically producing node-specific triggers, reducing the risk of trigger detection while reliably activating the backdoor. Lastly, we develop a persistent backdoor anchoring module that firmly anchors the backdoor to fine-tuning-insensitive parameters, enhancing the persistence of the backdoor under downstream adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and persistence of GFM-BA.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing the evasion attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems using domain-specific Universal Adversarial Perturbations, showcasing its superior effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address vulnerabilities in Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems, which are prone to adversarial attacks such as Universal Adversarial Perturbations.

Method: The authors propose a novel domain-constrained Universal Adversarial Perturbation attack leveraging the Pearson Correlation Coefficient in the loss function to enhance its effectiveness.

Result: Experimental results show that their proposed Customized UAP outperforms existing adversarial methods and other UAP baselines under realistic conditions.

Conclusion: Customized UAP is effective against Deep Reinforcement Learning-based IDS in realistic domain-constrained environments, setting a new benchmark for adversarial attack design.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a vital role in defending modern cyber physical systems against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Deep Reinforcement Learning-based IDS, have shown promise due to their adaptive and generalization capabilities. However, recent studies reveal their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, including Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which can deceive models with a single, input-agnostic perturbation. In this work, we propose a novel UAP attack against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS under the domain-specific constraints derived from network data rules and feature relationships. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study that has explored UAP generation for the DRL-based IDS. In addition, this is the first work that focuses on developing a UAP against a DRL-based IDS under realistic domain constraints based on not only the basic domain rules but also mathematical relations between the features. Furthermore, we enhance the evasion performance of the proposed UAP, by introducing a customized loss function based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and we denote it as Customized UAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work using the PCC value in the UAP generation, even in the broader context. Four additional established UAP baselines are implemented for a comprehensive comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Customized UAP outperforms two input-dependent attacks including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and four UAP baselines, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world adversarial scenarios.

*Nuo Xu,Zhaoting Gong,Ran Ran,Jinwei Tang,Wujie Wen,Caiwen Ding*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents FHE-Agent, a framework leveraging a large language model to automate Fully Homomorphic Encryption configuration, outperforming traditional methods in precision and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying CKKS-based Fully Homomorphic Encryption for privacy-preserving Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is challenging due to the complex configurations requiring expert cryptographic knowledge.

Method: FHE-Agent combines a Large Language Model controller with a deterministic tool to manage configuration through a multi-fidelity workflow, involving static analysis and encrypted evaluations.

Result: FHE-Agent outperforms naïve search strategies in precision and latency and successfully identifies secure configurations for deep neural networks where heuristic methods fail.

Conclusion: FHE-Agent is effective in making FHE configurations more accessible and efficient, enabling secure implementations of complex ML models without deep cryptographic expertise.

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), particularly the CKKS scheme, is a promising enabler for privacy-preserving MLaaS, but its practical deployment faces a prohibitive barrier: it heavily relies on domain expertise. Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts. Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics. These "one-shot" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks.
  We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process. By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair. The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates.
  We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet). FHE-Agent consistently achieves better precision and lower latency than naïve search strategies. Crucially, it automatically discovers feasible, 128-bit secure configurations for complex models where baseline heuristics and one-shot prompts fail to produce a valid setup.

TL;DR: ADALOC is proposed to ensure adaptable and secure deployment of DNNs by allowing model usage control to adjust with post-deployment updates, achieving strong protections and high task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are significant intellectual property, and current methods for model usage control are inadequate for handling continual updates like fine-tuning post-deployment.

Method: ADALOC introduces a mechanism where a subset of weights acts as an intrinsic access key, allowing for dynamic model updates without requiring full re-keying after each evolution.

Result: ADALOC performed well on datasets like CIFAR-100 and architectures such as ResNet, showing strong protections with unauthorized usage dropping to random guessing levels and authorized usage maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: ADALOC provides an effective and adaptable solution for securely deploying and managing DNNs in dynamic real-world environments.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become valuable intellectual property of model owners, due to the substantial resources required for their development. To protect these assets in the deployed environment, recent research has proposed model usage control mechanisms to ensure models cannot be used without proper authorization. These methods typically lock the utility of the model by embedding an access key into its parameters. However, they often assume static deployment, and largely fail to withstand continual post-deployment model updates, such as fine-tuning or task-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose ADALOC, to endow key-based model usage control with adaptability during model evolution. It strategically selects a subset of weights as an intrinsic access key, which enables all model updates to be confined to this key throughout the evolution lifecycle. ADALOC enables using the access key to restore the keyed model to the latest authorized states without redistributing the entire network (i.e., adaptation), and frees the model owner from full re-keying after each model update (i.e., lock preservation). We establish a formal foundation to underpin ADALOC, providing crucial bounds such as the errors introduced by updates restricted to the access key. Experiments on standard benchmarks, such as CIFAR-100, Caltech-256, and Flowers-102, and modern architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and ConvNeXt, demonstrate that ADALOC achieves high accuracy under significant updates while retaining robust protections. Specifically, authorized usages consistently achieve strong task-specific performance, while unauthorized usage accuracy drops to near-random guessing levels (e.g., 1.01% on CIFAR-100), compared to up to 87.01% without ADALOC. This shows that ADALOC can offer a practical solution for adaptive and protected DNN deployment in evolving real-world scenarios.

### [859] [Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18025)
*Yifan Luo,Meng Zhang,Jin Xu,Junting Chen,Jianwei Huang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy (CSDP) framework addressing privacy challenges in correlated sequential data streams by modeling them as Coupling Markov Chains. It proposes a novel mechanism called FRAN that improves privacy-utility trade-off significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve privacy in correlated sequential data while maintaining utility, as traditional Differential Privacy mechanisms fail to handle interdependence in data streams.

Method: The authors model data streams as Coupling Markov Chains, derive leakage bounds using spectral terms, and present the FRAN mechanism which combines techniques like data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise addition.

Result: CSDP and FRAN demonstrate approximately 50% improvement in privacy-utility trade-off against correlated-DP methods and significantly outperform standard DP approaches, showing improved efficiency and practicality.

Conclusion: CSDP effectively addresses privacy concerns in correlated sequential data with better guarantees and utility, providing a robust solution for applications in healthcare, finance, and smart cities.

Abstract: Data streams collected from multiple sources are rarely independent. Values evolve over time and influence one another across sequences. These correlations improve prediction in healthcare, finance, and smart-city control yet violate the record-independence assumption built into most Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. To restore rigorous privacy guarantees without sacrificing utility, we introduce Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy (CSDP), a framework specifically designed for preserving privacy in correlated sequential data. CSDP addresses two linked challenges: quantifying the extra information an attacker gains from joint temporal and cross-sequence links, and adding just enough noise to hide that information while keeping the data useful. We model multivariate streams as a Coupling Markov Chain, yielding the derived loose leakage bound expressed with a few spectral terms and revealing a counterintuitive result: stronger coupling can actually decrease worst-case leakage by dispersing perturbations across sequences. Guided by these bounds, we build the Freshness-Regulated Adaptive Noise (FRAN) mechanism--combining data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise--that runs in linear time. Tests on two-sequence datasets show that CSDP improves the privacy-utility trade-off by approximately 50% over existing correlated-DP methods and by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard DP approach.

### [860] [Towards Harnessing the Power of LLMs for ABAC Policy Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18098)
*More Aayush Babasaheb,Shamik Sural*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper assesses Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google Gemini and OpenAI ChatGPT for mining Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) policies, reporting effectiveness in small-scale scenarios but challenges in larger systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABAC policies provide fine-grained access management, but increasing policy complexity makes formulation and evaluation difficult.

Method: An experimental Python framework was used to create randomized access data and compare LLM-generated policies to ground truth via standard performance metrics.

Result: LLMs effectively inferred valid ABAC policies for small systems but showed decreasing accuracy, precision, and scalability as system size increased.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate potential for small-scale ABAC policy mining but face limitations in scalability; hybrid approaches are proposed for improved scalability and interpretability.

Abstract: This paper presents an empirical investigation into the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform automated Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) policy mining. While ABAC provides fine-grained, context-aware access management, the increasing number and complexity of access policies can make their formulation and evaluation rather challenging. To address the task of synthesizing concise yet accurate policies, we evaluate the performance of some of the state-of-the-art LLMs, specifically Google Gemini (Flash and Pro) and OpenAI ChatGPT, as potential policy mining engines. An experimental framework was developed in Python to generate randomized access data parameterized by varying numbers of subjects, objects, and initial policy sets. The baseline policy sets, which govern permission decisions between subjects and objects, serve as the ground truth for comparison. Each LLM-generated policy was evaluated against the baseline policy using standard performance metrics. The results indicate that LLMs can effectively infer compact and valid ABAC policies for small-scale scenarios. However, as the system size increases, characterized by higher numbers of subjects and objects, LLM outputs exhibit declining accuracy and precision, coupled with significant increase in the size of policy generated, which is beyond the optimal size. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLM architectures for scalable policy mining in access control domains. Future work will explore hybrid approaches that combine prompt optimization with classical rule mining algorithms to improve scalability and interpretability in complex ABAC environments.

*Ryan Wong,Hosea David Yu Fei Ng,Dhananjai Sharma,Glenn Jun Jie Ng,Kavishvaran Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study identifies jailbreak risks to LLMs and proposes three defense strategies, showing their effectiveness in reducing attack success, with code accessible online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the vulnerabilities of LLMs to jailbreak exploits, posing a significant security and ethical challenge.

Method: Three defenses are proposed: (1) prompt-level intervention, (2) logit-based steering, and (3) domain-specific agent defense, tested on benchmark datasets.

Result: The proposed defenses significantly reduce attack success rates, with complete mitigation achieved by the domain-specific agent defense.

Conclusion: This work underscores the importance of defending against jailbreaks in LLMs by proposing effective strategies, though trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability exist.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak exploits that bypass safety filters and induce harmful or unethical behavior. This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ACE-Safety, an innovative framework for enhancing Large Language Models' safety by iteratively optimizing attack and defense mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficiency of current isolated or static approaches in tackling evolving risks and safeguards of Large Language Models in dynamic real-world contexts.

Method: The authors propose a dual-process framework comprising Group-aware Strategy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (GS-MCTS) and Adversarial Curriculum Tree-aware Group Policy Optimization (AC-TGPO), focusing on adversarial attack generation and joint attack-defense training.

Result: Their approach outperforms existing methods in benchmarks for both attack efficiency and defense robustness.

Conclusion: The work presents a sustainable model for improving the safety and responsibility of AI systems, advancing both adversarial and defensive capabilities in alignment with the needs of real-world contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in web services, delivering unprecedented capabilities while amplifying societal risks. Existing works tend to focus on either isolated jailbreak attacks or static defenses, neglecting the dynamic interplay between evolving threats and safeguards in real-world web contexts. To mitigate these challenges, we propose ACE-Safety (Adversarial Co-Evolution for LLM Safety), a novel framework that jointly optimize attack and defense models by seamlessly integrating two key innovative procedures: (1) Group-aware Strategy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (GS-MCTS), which efficiently explores jailbreak strategies to uncover vulnerabilities and generate diverse adversarial samples; (2) Adversarial Curriculum Tree-aware Group Policy Optimization (AC-TGPO), which jointly trains attack and defense LLMs with challenging samples via curriculum reinforcement learning, enabling robust mutual improvement. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attack and defense approaches, and provides a feasible pathway for developing LLMs that can sustainably support responsible AI ecosystems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Medusa, a novel adversarial attack framework targeting multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems, achieving high success rates in hijacking medical decision-making processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address adversarial vulnerabilities in MMed-RAG systems, critical for safety in clinical decision support applications.

Method: It formulates adversarial attacks as perturbation optimization, integrating MPIL loss, surrogate model ensembles, and IRM-enhanced dual-loop optimization.

Result: Medusa achieves over 90% attack success rates across tasks, outperforming baselines, and remains robust against major defenses.

Conclusion: The findings stress significant vulnerabilities in MMed-RAG systems and emphasize the need for robust security measures in medical AI applications.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

*Md Akil Raihan Iftee,Syed Md. Ahnaf Hasan,Amin Ahsan Ali,AKM Mahbubur Rahman,Sajib Mistry,Aneesh Krishna*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedPoisonTTP, a test-time poisoning attack framework targeting federated learning systems during local model adaptation, showing its detrimental impact on performance in federated setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in federated learning during test-time personalization, where compromised clients can poison updates and harm both global and per-client performance.

Method: FedPoisonTTP creates adversarial poisons using a surrogate model, feature-consistent synthesis, and attack optimization, and injects them during local adaptation to degrade federated learning performance.

Result: Experiments on vision benchmarks demonstrate that poisoned inputs can severely reduce test-time performance across federated learning participants.

Conclusion: Test-time personalization in federated learning faces significant security risks, and FedPoisonTTP highlights the importance of developing more resilient adaptation methods.

Abstract: Test-time personalization in federated learning enables models at clients to adjust online to local domain shifts, enhancing robustness and personalization in deployment. Yet, existing federated learning work largely overlooks the security risks that arise when local adaptation occurs at test time. Heterogeneous domain arrivals, diverse adaptation algorithms, and limited cross-client visibility create vulnerabilities where compromised participants can craft poisoned inputs and submit adversarial updates that undermine both global and per-client performance. To address this threat, we introduce FedPoisonTTP, a realistic grey-box attack framework that explores test-time data poisoning in the federated adaptation setting. FedPoisonTTP distills a surrogate model from adversarial queries, synthesizes in-distribution poisons using feature-consistency, and optimizes attack objectives to generate high-entropy or class-confident poisons that evade common adaptation filters. These poisons are injected during local adaptation and spread through collaborative updates, leading to broad degradation. Extensive experiments on corrupted vision benchmarks show that compromised participants can substantially diminish overall test-time performance.

*Kaley Brauer,Aditya Prasad Dash,Meet J. Vyas,Ahmed Salim,Stiven Briand Massala*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: This paper proposes a domain adaptation pipeline using simulated and real galaxy datasets to enhance automated inference of galaxy properties like morphology and physical labels. The approach significantly improves target accuracy using advanced losses and matching techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable automated tools for inferring galaxy physical properties in large photometric surveys and mitigate domain shifts that degrade the transferability of simulation data to real galaxy surveys.

Method: The study introduces a pipeline utilizing simulated TNG50 galaxy data and real SDSS galaxy morphology labels, leveraging multiple backbone architectures and advanced loss functions (focal loss, effective-number class weighting, GeomLoss, and OT-based matching).

Result: The proposed pipeline improves target accuracy from ~46% (~30%) to ~87% (~62.6%) and achieves strong latent space mixing with a domain AUC near 0.5.

Conclusion: The advanced adaptation method effectively addresses domain shifts and enhances the accuracy of galaxy property inference in real survey data.

Abstract: Large photometric surveys will image billions of galaxies, but we currently lack quick, reliable automated ways to infer their physical properties like morphology, stellar mass, and star formation rates. Simulations provide galaxy images with ground-truth physical labels, but domain shifts in PSF, noise, backgrounds, selection, and label priors degrade transfer to real surveys. We present a preliminary domain adaptation pipeline that trains on simulated TNG50 galaxies and evaluates on real SDSS galaxies with morphology labels (elliptical/spiral/irregular). We train three backbones (CNN, $E(2)$-steerable CNN, ResNet-18) with focal loss and effective-number class weighting, and a feature-level domain loss $L_D$ built from GeomLoss (entropic Sinkhorn OT, energy distance, Gaussian MMD, and related metrics). We show that a combination of these losses with an OT-based "top_$k$ soft matching" loss that focuses $L_D$ on the worst-matched source-target pairs can further enhance domain alignment. With Euclidean distance, scheduled alignment weights, and top-$k$ matching, target accuracy (macro F1) rises from $\sim$46% ($\sim$30%) at no adaptation to $\sim$87% ($\sim$62.6%), with a domain AUC near 0.5, indicating strong latent-space mixing.

*Kasidis Arunruangsirilert,Jiro Katto*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates RD performance, encoding speed, and power consumption of GPU hardware encoders, comparing them to software encoders for real-time video tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for real-time video encoding for live streaming and high-resolution video necessitates high-efficiency GPU hardware encoders.

Method: Hardware encoders from NVIDIA, Intel GPUs, and Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile SoCs were compared against software encoders using metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and VMAF for RD performance and YouTube transcoding quality.

Result: GPU hardware encoders match the RD performance of software encoders in real-time, with an increase in encoding speed across newer hardware but limited RD gains between generations.

Conclusion: Modern GPUs provide efficient real-time encoding capabilities with negligible RD improvement across generations while meeting streaming quality requirements.

Abstract: Many GPUs have incorporated hardware-accelerated video encoders, which allow video encoding tasks to be offloaded from the main CPU and provide higher power efficiency. Over the years, many new video codecs such as H.265/HEVC, VP9, and AV1 were added to the latest GPU boards. Recently, the rise of live video content such as VTuber, game live-streaming, and live event broadcasts, drives the demand for high-efficiency hardware encoders in the GPUs to tackle these real-time video encoding tasks, especially at higher resolutions such as 4K/8K UHD. In this paper, RD performance, encoding speed, as well as power consumption of hardware encoders in several generations of NVIDIA, Intel GPUs as well as Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile SoCs were evaluated and compared to the software counterparts, including the latest H.266/VVC codec, using several metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and machine-learning based VMAF. The results show that modern GPU hardware encoders can match the RD performance of software encoders in real-time encoding scenarios, and while encoding speed increased in newer hardware, there is mostly negligible RD performance improvement between hardware generations. Finally, the bitrate required for each hardware encoder to match YouTube transcoding quality was also calculated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of static computation graphs in existing models and address challenges posed by cellular heterogeneity in cancer detection on WSIs.

Method: The proposed model, SAGE, dynamically routes input through adaptive networks using hierarchical gating, while preserving representation and bridging CNN-Transformer modules with SA-Hub for flexible segmentation.

Result: SAGE-UNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on medical benchmarks (EBHI, DigestPath, GlaS) with Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, showcasing superior adaptability and domain generalization.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates scalability and adaptability in visual reasoning while achieving state-of-the-art performance, providing a robust solution for dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual tasks.

Abstract: The substantial diversity in cell scale and form remains a primary challenge in computer-aided cancer detection on gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs), attributable to cellular heterogeneity. Existing CNN-Transformer hybrids rely on static computation graphs with fixed routing, which consequently causes redundant computation and limits their adaptability to input variability. We propose Shape-Adapting Gated Experts (SAGE), an input-adaptive framework that enables dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual networks. SAGE reconfigures static backbones into dynamically routed expert architectures. SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules. Embodied as SAGE-UNet, our model achieves superior segmentation on three medical benchmarks: EBHI, DigestPath, and GlaS, yielding state-of-the-art Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, respectively, and robustly generalizes across domains by adaptively balancing local refinement and global context. SAGE provides a scalable foundation for dynamic expert routing, enabling flexible visual reasoning.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SALPA, a robust optimization framework to address geolocation uncertainties in spaceborne LiDAR systems like GEDI, improving forest structure assessments globally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geolocation uncertainties (5-15m) in spaceborne LiDAR data hinder accurate forest structure and carbon stock assessments globally; existing correction methods are either limited in data availability or solution accuracy.

Method: SALPA integrates three optimization paradigms (gradient-based, evolutionary, and swarm intelligence) alongside five distance metrics, working solely with available digital elevation models and geoid data.

Result: Validation in Japan and France showed SALPA improved GEDI geolocation by 15-16% and outperformed the state-of-the-art GeoGEDI algorithm by 0.5-2%.

Conclusion: SALPA provides a transferable, efficient, and accurate solution for geolocation correction, ensuring reliable forest monitoring and aiding global climate policies.

Abstract: Spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems, such as NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide forest structure for global carbon assessments. However, geolocation uncertainties (typically 5-15 m) propagate systematically through derived products, undermining forest profile estimates, including carbon stock assessments. Existing correction methods face critical limitations: waveform simulation approaches achieve meter-level accuracy but require high-resolution LiDAR data unavailable in most regions, while terrain-based methods employ deterministic grid searches that may overlook optimal solutions in continuous solution spaces. We present SALPA (Spaceborne LiDAR Point Adjustment), a multi-algorithm optimization framework integrating three optimization paradigms with five distance metrics. Operating exclusively with globally available digital elevation models and geoid data, SALPA explores continuous solution spaces through gradient-based, evolutionary, and swarm intelligence approaches. Validation across contrasting sites: topographically complex Nikko, Japan, and flat Landes, France, demonstrates 15-16% improvements over original GEDI positions and 0.5-2% improvements over the state-of-the-art GeoGEDI algorithm. L-BFGS-B with Area-based metrics achieves optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, while population-based algorithms (genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization) excel in complex terrain. The platform-agnostic framework facilitates straightforward adaptation to emerging spaceborne LiDAR missions, providing a generalizable foundation for universal geolocation correction essential for reliable global forest monitoring and climate policy decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop signal reconstruction models that do not require ground truth, addressing challenges with training complex networks like DEQs using Equivariant Imaging losses.

Method: The method involves utilizing implicit differentiation and modular backpropagation to train DEQs with EI losses efficiently.

Result: DEQs trained using implicit differentiation outperform standard methods, showing better results than Jacobian-free backpropagation and proving effectiveness in approximating invariant priors.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that DEQs trained with EI effectively approximate proximal maps of invariant priors, offering a robust method for unsupervised signal reconstruction.

Abstract: Equivariant imaging (EI) enables training signal reconstruction models without requiring ground truth data by leveraging signal symmetries. Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) are a powerful class of neural networks where the output is a fixed point of a learned operator. However, training DEQs with complex EI losses requires implicit differentiation through fixed-point computations, whose implementation can be challenging. We show that backpropagation can be implemented modularly, simplifying training. Experiments demonstrate that DEQs trained with implicit differentiation outperform those trained with Jacobian-free backpropagation and other baseline methods. Additionally, we find evidence that EI-trained DEQs approximate the proximal map of an invariant prior.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning-based approach for detecting and monitoring retinal neovascularization (RNV) using widefield optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNV in diabetic retinopathy can lead to vision loss, but timely intervention can prevent it. Widefield OCTA presents an opportunity for enhanced early detection of RNV, but existing algorithms are insufficient for these advanced imaging methods.

Method: The study employs a fully automated deep learning model that reframes RNV identification as a binary localization task rather than relying on traditional retinal segmentation. It was trained on 589 widefield scans across multiple devices and clinics.

Result: The approach demonstrated an AUC of 0.96-0.99 for RNV diagnosis and an IOU of 0.76-0.88 for segmentation, indicating its effectiveness in accurate detection and monitoring of RNV.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods tailored for widefield OCTA imaging show promise in improving clinical RNV screening and management, with potential for longitudinal monitoring of lesions.

Abstract: Retinal neovascularization (RNV) is a vision threatening development in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Vision loss associated with RNV is preventable with timely intervention, making RNV clinical screening and monitoring a priority. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) provides high-resolution imaging and high-sensitivity detection of RNV lesions. With recent commercial devices introducing widefield OCTA imaging to the clinic, the technology stands to improve early detection of RNV pathology. However, to meet clinical requirements these imaging capabilities must be combined with effective RNV detection and quantification, but existing algorithms for OCTA images are optimized for conventional, i.e. narrow, fields of view. Here, we present a novel approach for RNV diagnosis and staging on widefield OCT/OCTA. Unlike conventional methods dependent on multi-layer retinal segmentation, our model reframes RNV identification as a direct binary localization task. Our fully automated approach was trained and validated on 589 widefield scans (17x17-mm to 26x21-mm) collected from multiple devices at multiple clinics. Our method achieved a device-dependent area under curve (AUC) ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 for RNV diagnosis, and mean intersection over union (IOU) ranging from 0.76 to 0.88 for segmentation. We also demonstrate our method's ability to monitor lesion growth longitudinally. Our results indicate that deep learning-based analysis for widefield OCTA images could offer a valuable means for improving RNV screening and management.

*Ziye Zhang,Bin Pan,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SSRNO, a method to reconstruct hyperspectral images (HSIs) from multispectral data, incorporating physical principles for consistent predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven models often neglect physical principles, resulting in unrealistic hyperspectral images, particularly in atmosphere-affected bands.

Method: SSRNO integrates atmospheric radiative transfer priors into its three-stage framework: upsampling (using guidance matrix projection), reconstruction (neural operator with U-shaped spectral-aware convolution layers), and refinement (hard constraints to eliminate distortion).

Result: The method achieves continuous spectral reconstruction, zero-shot extrapolation, and demonstrates strong performance and generalization in experiments.

Conclusion: With its incorporation of physical principles and advanced methods, SSRNO provides effective and plausible hyperspectral imaging solutions, overcoming limitations of previous data-driven models.

Abstract: Spectral super-resolution (SSR) aims to reconstruct hyperspectral images (HSIs) from multispectral observations, with broad applications in remote sensing. Data-driven methods are widely used, but they often overlook physical principles, leading to unrealistic spectra, particularly in atmosphere-affected bands. To address this challenge, we propose the Spectral Super-Resolution Neural Operator (SSRNO), which incorporates atmospheric radiative transfer (ART) prior into the data-driven procedure, yielding more physically consistent predictions. The proposed SSRNO framework consists of three stages: upsampling, reconstruction, and refinement. In the upsampling stage, we leverage prior information to expand the input multispectral image, producing a physically plausible hyperspectral estimate. Subsequently, we utilize a neural operator in the reconstruction stage to learn a continuous mapping across the spectral domain. Finally, the refinement stage imposes a hard constraint on the output HSI to eliminate color distortion. The upsampling and refinement stages are implemented via the proposed guidance matrix projection (GMP) method, and the reconstruction neural operator adopts U-shaped spectral-aware convolution (SAC) layers to capture multi-scale features. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate the optimality of the GMP method. With the neural operator and ART priors, SSRNO also achieves continuous spectral reconstruction and zero-shot extrapolation. Various experiments validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed approach.

### [874] [Neural B-Frame Coding: Tackling Domain Shift Issues with Lightweight Online Motion Resolution Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18724)
*Sang NguyenQuang,Xiem HoangVan,Wen-Hsiao Peng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses domain-shift issues in learned B-frame codecs by proposing lightweight classifiers to optimize downsampling for motion estimation, reducing the need for computationally expensive rate-distortion optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome domain-shift issues caused by mismatched Group-of-Pictures sizes in B-frame codecs, particularly for scenarios with large motion, and to reduce computational costs during motion estimation.

Method: The authors propose three classifiers to predict downsampling factors: (1) Binary classifier trained with Focal Loss, (2) Multi-class classifier trained with soft labels based on rate-distortion costs, and (3) Co-class approach combining multi-class and binary classifier capabilities. These models utilize state signals from video frames to improve performance without codec retraining.

Result: The proposed classifiers achieve coding performance comparable to traditional exhaustive search methods but with significantly reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: Lightweight classifiers can effectively address domain-shift issues in hierarchical temporal prediction and offer significant computational cost savings while maintaining effective coding performance. They integrate seamlessly with existing codecs.

Abstract: Learned B-frame codecs with hierarchical temporal prediction often encounter the domain-shift issue due to mismatches between the Group-of-Pictures (GOP) sizes for training and testing, leading to inaccurate motion estimates, particularly for large motion. A common solution is to turn large motion into small motion by downsampling video frames during motion estimation. However, determining the optimal downsampling factor typically requires costly rate-distortion optimization. This work introduces lightweight classifiers to predict downsampling factors. These classifiers leverage simple state signals from current and reference frames to balance rate-distortion performance with computational cost. Three variants are proposed: (1) a binary classifier (Bi-Class) trained with Focal Loss to choose between high and low resolutions, (2) a multi-class classifier (Mu-Class) trained with novel soft labels based on rate-distortion costs, and (3) a co-class approach (Co-Class) that combines the predictive capability of the multi-class classifier with the selective search of the binary classifier. All classifier methods can work seamlessly with existing B-frame codecs without requiring codec retraining. Experimental results show that they achieve coding performance comparable to exhaustive search methods while significantly reducing computational complexity.

### [875] [Arbitrage-Free Bond and Yield Curve Forecasting with Neural Filters under HJM Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17892)
*Xiang Gao,Cody Hyndman*

Main category: q-fin.MF

TL;DR: The paper introduces an arbitrage-free deep learning framework for forecasting yield curves and bond prices, leveraging enhanced neural networks and explicit regularization for better predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a forecasting model that ensures arbitrage-free consistency when predicting yield curves and bond prices, addressing market flaws found in existing models.

Method: Combining Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) term-structure model, Nelson-Siegel parameterization, and recurrent neural networks like LSTM/CLSTM, integrating filters (Kalman, extended Kalman, particle) and arbitrage error regularization (AER).

Result: Applying the model to U.S. Treasury and corporate bond data, it showed significant improvements in market consistency and prediction accuracy, especially for short maturities at 5-day-ahead forecasts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances forecasting precision and consistency, particularly for short-term horizons, improving usability in bond markets.

Abstract: We develop an arbitrage-free deep learning framework for yield curve and bond price forecasting based on the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) term-structure model and a dynamic Nelson-Siegel parameterization of forward rates. Our approach embeds a no-arbitrage drift restriction into a neural state-space architecture by combining Kalman, extended Kalman, and particle filters with recurrent neural networks (LSTM/CLSTM), and introduces an explicit arbitrage error regularization (AER) term during training. The model is applied to U.S. Treasury and corporate bond data, and its performance is evaluated for both yield-space and price-space predictions at 1-day and 5-day horizons. Empirically, arbitrage regularization leads to its strongest improvements at short maturities, particularly in 5-day-ahead forecasts, increasing market-consistency as measured by bid-ask hit rates and reducing dollar-denominated prediction errors.

### [876] [Torsion-Space Diffusion for Protein Backbone Generation with Geometric Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19184)
*Lakshaditya Singh,Adwait Shelke,Divyansh Agrawal*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Torsion-Space Diffusion Model for generating protein backbones that ensures physical validity by operating in torsion space and refining structures for compactness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for protein design in Cartesian space fail to maintain strict geometric constraints, leading to invalid structures. This paper aims to overcome this issue.

Method: The proposed method uses a Torsion-Space Diffusion model for denoising torsion angles and a forward-kinematics module for reconstructing 3D coordinates with perfect local geometry. A post-processing step optimizes structural compactness without violating geometry constraints.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate 100% bond-length accuracy and reduced Radius of Gyration (Rg) error from 70% to 18.6%, compared to Cartesian diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: The approach offers a reliable framework for generating physically valid and geometrically compact protein backbones, paving the way for advancements in full-atom protein generation.

Abstract: Designing new protein structures is fundamental to computational biology, enabling advances in therapeutic molecule discovery and enzyme engineering. Existing diffusion-based generative models typically operate in Cartesian coordinate space, where adding noise disrupts strict geometric constraints such as fixed bond lengths and angles, often producing physically invalid structures. To address this limitation, we propose a Torsion-Space Diffusion Model that generates protein backbones by denoising torsion angles, ensuring perfect local geometry by construction. A differentiable forward-kinematics module reconstructs 3D coordinates with fixed 3.8 Angstrom backbone bond lengths while a constrained post-processing refinement optimizes global compactness via Radius of Gyration (Rg) correction, without violating bond constraints. Experiments on standard PDB proteins demonstrate 100% bond-length accuracy and significantly improved structural compactness, reducing Rg error from 70% to 18.6% compared to Cartesian diffusion baselines. Overall, this hybrid torsion-diffusion plus geometric-refinement framework generates physically valid and compact protein backbones, providing a promising path toward full-atom protein generation.

*Maria Bou-Sakr-El-Tayar,Jason J. Bramburger,Matthew J. Colbrook*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: Introducing tapered (weighted) methods to improve the convergence speed of ergodic averages in dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ergodic averages, commonly used in dynamical systems, converge slowly, hindering the efficiency of data-driven algorithms.

Method: Weighted Birkhoff averages are applied in existing algorithms to enhance their convergence—including wtDMD, wtEDMD, wtSINDy, and others.

Result: The weighted techniques are demonstrated to yield significantly faster and more accurate results across various examples including fluid flows and El Niño data.

Conclusion: Incorporating weighted averages is a costless, easy, and effective improvement for better results in dynamical systems modeling.

Abstract: Many data-driven algorithms in dynamical systems rely on ergodic averages that converge painfully slowly. One simple idea changes this: taper the ends. Weighted Birkhoff averages can converge much faster (sometimes superpolynomially, even exponentially) and can be incorporated seamlessly into existing methods. We demonstrate this with five weighted algorithms: weighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (wtDMD), weighted Extended DMD (wtEDMD), weighted Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (wtSINDy), weighted spectral measure estimation, and weighted diffusion forecasting. Across examples ranging from fluid flows to El Niño data, the message is clear: weighting costs nothing, is easy to implement, and often delivers markedly better results from the same data.

*Sumon Kanti Dey,Manvi S,Zeel Mehta,Meet Shah,Unnati Agrawal,Suhani Jalota,Azra Ismail*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper critiques the reliance on Western-centric benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in health applications, using a chatbot for sexual and reproductive health in India as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the potential of LLMs in expanding health information access in underserved communities of the Global South and expose inadequacies in current benchmarks that fail to account for cultural variability.

Method: The study used HealthBench to evaluate 637 single-turn queries on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) from an underserved Indian community, supplemented with qualitative analyses from public health experts and trained annotators.

Result: The automated evaluation by HealthBench produced low ratings while qualitative assessments found responses were culturally appropriate and medically accurate. The evaluation exposed limitations in current benchmarks due to Western biases related to legal norms, dietary assumptions, and economic contexts.

Conclusion: Current evaluation frameworks are insufficient for diverse cultural and healthcare contexts. There is a need for culturally adaptive benchmarks that align with high quality standards and account for diverse population needs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been positioned as having the potential to expand access to health information in the Global South, yet their evaluation remains heavily dependent on benchmarks designed around Western norms. We present insights from a preliminary benchmarking exercise with a chatbot for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) for an underserved community in India. We evaluated using HealthBench, a benchmark for conversational health models by OpenAI. We extracted 637 SRH queries from the dataset and evaluated on the 330 single-turn conversations. Responses were evaluated using HealthBench's rubric-based automated grader, which rated responses consistently low. However, qualitative analysis by trained annotators and public health experts revealed that many responses were actually culturally appropriate and medically accurate. We highlight recurring issues, particularly a Western bias, such as for legal framing and norms (e.g., breastfeeding in public), diet assumptions (e.g., fish safe to eat during pregnancy), and costs (e.g., insurance models). Our findings demonstrate the limitations of current benchmarks in capturing the effectiveness of systems built for different cultural and healthcare contexts. We argue for the development of culturally adaptive evaluation frameworks that meet quality standards while recognizing needs of diverse populations.

*Tim Schlippe,Matthias Wölfel,Koena Ronny Mabokela*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study examined how cultural proximity affects the detection of AI-generated fake news, focusing on South African participants compared to people from other nationalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the human capability to detect AI-generated fake news across cultural contexts, given the increasing sophistication of AI in creating fabricated content.

Method: A survey was conducted with South African and non-South African participants who evaluated 10 real and 10 AI-generated fake South African news articles. Performance was compared between the groups.

Result: South Africans detected true news better (40% deviation vs. others' 52%) but were worse at identifying fake news (62% vs. 55%). Cultural familiarity aided authentic information verification but introduced bias in evaluating fake content.

Conclusion: Cultural context impacts misinformation detection, with familiarity improving true content verification but possibly biasing fake content judgments. Insights can inform global strategies to combat misinformation.

Abstract: This study investigates how cultural proximity affects the ability to detect AI-generated fake news by comparing South African participants with those from other nationalities. As large language models increasingly enable the creation of sophisticated fake news, understanding human detection capabilities becomes crucial, particularly across different cultural contexts. We conducted a survey where 89 participants (56 South Africans, 33 from other nationalities) evaluated 10 true South African news articles and 10 AI-generated fake versions. Results reveal an asymmetric pattern: South Africans demonstrated superior performance in detecting true news about their country (40% deviation from ideal rating) compared to other participants (52%), but performed worse at identifying fake news (62% vs. 55%). This difference may reflect South Africans' higher overall trust in news sources. Our analysis further shows that South Africans relied more on content knowledge and contextual understanding when judging credibility, while participants from other countries emphasised formal linguistic features such as grammar and structure. Overall, the deviation from ideal rating was similar between groups (51% vs. 53%), suggesting that cultural familiarity appears to aid verification of authentic information but may also introduce bias when evaluating fabricated content. These insights contribute to understanding cross-cultural dimensions of misinformation detection and inform strategies for combating AI-generated fake news in increasingly globalised information ecosystems where content crosses cultural and geographical boundaries.

### [881] [Chatbots to strengthen democracy: An interdisciplinary seminar to train identifying argumentation techniques of science denial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17678)
*Ingo Siegert,Jan Nehring,Aranxa Márquez Ampudia,Matthias Busch,Stefan Hillmann*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper presents a seminar module using Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate science-denial arguments for educational purposes, teaching students AI technologies while exploring ways to combat misinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the rising challenge of science denial and misinformation on social media, which current regulatory approaches alone fail to address. Educational techniques are needed to empower better critical engagement.

Method: The method proposes an interdisciplinary seminar where groups of students create an AI chatbot simulating science-denial arguments using the RASA framework. The chatbot is integrated with LLMs for realistic dialogues and tested through a user study.

Result: The seminar provides students practical experience in AI while evaluating the feasibility of LLMs to aid users in identifying misinformation and improving resilience to toxic conversations.

Conclusion: While the seminar does not focus on creating chatbots for active debunking, it serves as an innovative educational approach to teach AI technologies and explore combating misinformation through simulated interactions.

Abstract: In recent times, discussions on social media platforms have increasingly come under scrutiny due to the proliferation of science denial and fake news. Traditional solutions, such as regulatory actions, have been implemented to mitigate the spread of misinformation; however, these measures alone are not sufficient. To complement these efforts, educational approaches are becoming essential in empowering users to critically engage with misinformation. Conversation training, through serious games or personalized methods, has emerged as a promising strategy to help users handle science denial and toxic conversation tactics. This paper suggests an interdisciplinary seminar to explore the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as a persona of a science denier to support people in identifying misinformation and improving resilience against toxic interactions. In the seminar, groups of four to five students will develop an AI-based chatbot that enables realistic interactions with science-denial argumentation structures. The task involves planning the setting, integrating a Large Language Model to facilitate natural dialogues, implementing the chatbot using the RASA framework, and evaluating the outcomes in a user study. It is crucial that users understand what they need to do during the interaction, how to conclude it, and how the relevant information is conveyed. The seminar does not aim to develop chatbots for practicing debunking but serves to teach AI technologies and test the feasibility of this idea for future applications. The chatbot seminar is conducted as a hybrid, parallel master's module at the participating educational institutions.

*Douglas C. Schmidt,Dan Runfola*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper discusses the impact of natural language programming powered by AI on programming, computational thinking, and education, proposing reforms for embracing these changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the shift in programming brought about by AI-powered tools, which allow users to articulate problems in natural language, altering how we teach and practice computer science and data science.

Method: The paper explores education reforms, distinctions between programmers and prompt-crafting problem solvers, and computational science principles by examining the impact of natural language programming and AI tools.

Result: The findings highlight the need for educators and industry leaders to adapt curricula to focus on computational thinking, problem-solving, and AI-driven practices rather than traditional manual coding.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the rise of AI-powered coding tools necessitates a paradigm shift in programming education to prepare a generation of critical thinkers and solution designers who can effectively utilize AI for computation.

Abstract: Mastering one or more programming languages has historically been the gateway to implementing ideas on a computer. Today, that gateway is widening with advances in large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered coding assistants. What matters is no longer just fluency in traditional programming languages but the ability to think computationally by translating problems into forms that can be solved with computing tools. The capabilities enabled by these AI-augmented tools are rapidly leading to the commoditization of computational thinking, such that anyone who can articulate a problem in natural language can potentially harness computing power via AI.
  This shift is poised to radically influence how we teach computer science and data science in the United States and around the world. Educators and industry leaders are grappling with how to adapt: What should students learn when the hottest new programming language is English? How do we prepare a generation of computational thinkers who need not code every algorithm manually, but must still think critically, design solutions, and verify AI-augmented results?
  This paper explores these questions, examining the impact of natural language programming on software development, the emerging distinction between programmers and prompt-crafting problem solvers, the reforms needed in computer science and data science curricula, and the importance of maintaining our fundamental computational science principles in an AI-augmented future. Along the way, we compare approaches and share best practices for embracing this new paradigm in computing education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore responsible frameworks for human-AI co-creation that maintain ethical and creative integrity, particularly in subjective mediums.

Method: Employed the 'Workflow as Medium' paradigm to develop CIL; tested it by creating two graphic novellas while tackling AI's challenges through iterative teaming strategies.

Result: Produced two graphic novellas ('The Steward' and 'Fork the Vote') and a refined human-AI collaboration framework addressing AI sycophancy, capability limits, and effective critique practices.

Conclusion: CIL offers a disciplined approach for responsible human-AI co-creation and provides accessible insights into AI's societal implications, fostering literacy and dialogue.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Creative Intelligence Loop (CIL), a novel socio-technical framework for responsible human-AI co-creation. Rooted in the 'Workflow as Medium' paradigm, the CIL proposes a disciplined structure for dynamic human-AI collaboration, guiding the strategic integration of diverse AI teammates who function as collaborators while the human remains the final arbiter for ethical alignment and creative integrity. The CIL was empirically demonstrated through the practice-led creation of two graphic novellas, investigating how AI could serve as an effective creative colleague within a subjective medium lacking objective metrics. The process required navigating multifaceted challenges including AI's 'jagged frontier' of capabilities, sycophancy, and attention-scarce feedback environments. This prompted iterative refinement of teaming practices, yielding emergent strategies: a multi-faceted critique system integrating adversarial AI roles to counter sycophancy, and prioritizing 'feedback-ready' concrete artifacts to elicit essential human critique. The resulting graphic novellas analyze distinct socio-technical governance failures: 'The Steward' examines benevolent AI paternalism in smart cities, illustrating how algorithmic hubris can erode freedom; 'Fork the Vote' probes democratic legitimacy by comparing centralized AI opacity with emergent collusion in federated networks. This work contributes a self-improving framework for responsible human-AI co-creation and two graphic novellas designed to foster AI literacy and dialogue through accessible narrative analysis of AI's societal implications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Priority Score for optimizing resource allocation to high-risk neighborhoods for childhood lead exposure, but found that large language models (LLMs) are insufficient in allocating resources effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public health agencies struggle to identify and prioritize high-risk neighborhoods due to limited resources, necessitating a tool to integrate and analyze vulnerability indicators effectively.

Method: The authors developed a Priority Score combining factors like untested child proportions, lead exposure prevalence, and public health coverage, while testing LLMs like ChatGPT in distributing test kits across three cities based on neighborhood vulnerability.

Result: The study found LLMs, including ChatGPT, demonstrated limited accuracy (averaging 0.46) in resource allocation, frequently overlooking high-priority neighborhoods and relying on outdated or non-empirical data.

Conclusion: LLMs currently face significant challenges in evidence-based reasoning and data interpretation, making them unreliable for critical public health resource allocation tasks.

Abstract: Public health agencies face critical challenges in identifying high-risk neighborhoods for childhood lead exposure with limited resources for outreach and intervention programs. To address this, we develop a Priority Score integrating untested children proportions, elevated blood lead prevalence, and public health coverage patterns to support optimized resource allocation decisions across 136 neighborhoods in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. We leverage these allocation tasks, which require integrating multiple vulnerability indicators and interpreting empirical evidence, to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) with agentic reasoning and deep research capabilities can effectively allocate public health resources when presented with structured allocation scenarios. LLMs were tasked with distributing 1,000 test kits within each city based on neighborhood vulnerability indicators. Results reveal significant limitations: LLMs frequently overlooked neighborhoods with highest lead prevalence and largest proportions of untested children, such as West Englewood in Chicago, while allocating disproportionate resources to lower-priority areas like Hunts Point in New York City. Overall accuracy averaged 0.46, reaching a maximum of 0.66 with ChatGPT 5 Deep Research. Despite their marketed deep research capabilities, LLMs struggled with fundamental limitations in information retrieval and evidence-based reasoning, frequently citing outdated data and allowing non-empirical narratives about neighborhood conditions to override quantitative vulnerability indicators.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing territorial data from animated historical maps is challenging, and there is a need for a tool that can extract such data without pre-existing datasets.

Method: It uses HSV-based color segmentation, RGB filtering, and Direct-Neighbor Filtering alongside temporal preprocessing to transform videos into structured data.

Result: The tool was tested on ten Chinese dynasties' maps and successfully aligned pixel counts with historical expectations, validating its reliability.

Conclusion: ATDE is useful for educational purposes, exploratory studies, and comparative analyses of territorial dynamics. It's flexible and doesn't require pre-existing shapefiles.

Abstract: We present Animated Territorial Data Extractor (ATDE), a computer vision tool that extracts quantitative territorial data from animated historical map videos. ATDE employs HSV-based color segmentation, RGB channel filtering, and Direct-Neighbor Filtering to identify and count pixels representing territorial control. Combined with preprocessing for temporal alignment and cross-video scaling, the pipeline converts animated videos into structured time-series data. We demonstrate the tool on ten Chinese dynasties (200 BCE - 1912 CE), producing year-by-year pixel counts that align with expected historical patterns. While not a substitute for authoritative historical datasets, ATDE is well-suited for educational demonstrations, preliminary data exploration, and comparative analysis of territorial dynamics. The tool requires no pre-existing shapefiles and can be applied to any animated map video given seed colors and basic configuration. Code and examples are available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inverse rendering techniques struggle with high-genus surfaces, often losing crucial topological features and oversmoothing surfaces due to optimization issues.

Method: The proposed approach uses an adaptive V-cycle remeshing scheme and a re-parametrized Adam optimizer to handle gradient issues while preserving topology. It enforces topological consistency using topological primitives informed by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

Result: The method outperformed the state-of-the-art in reconstructing 3D meshes, showing significant improvements in Chamfer Distance and Volume IoU, especially for high-genus surfaces.

Conclusion: This approach effectively enhances both topological and geometric awareness in reconstructing detailed 3D meshes while addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: We present a topology-informed inverse rendering approach for reconstructing high-genus surface meshes from multi-view images. Compared to 3D representations like voxels and point clouds, mesh-based representations are preferred as they enable the application of differential geometry theory and are optimized for modern graphics pipelines. However, existing inverse rendering methods often fail catastrophically on high-genus surfaces, leading to the loss of key topological features, and tend to oversmooth low-genus surfaces, resulting in the loss of surface details. This failure stems from their overreliance on Adam-based optimizers, which can lead to vanishing and exploding gradients. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an adaptive V-cycle remeshing scheme in conjunction with a re-parametrized Adam optimizer to enhance topological and geometric awareness. By periodically coarsening and refining the deforming mesh, our method informs mesh vertices of their current topology and geometry before optimization, mitigating gradient issues while preserving essential topological features. Additionally, we enforce topological consistency by constructing topological primitives with genus numbers that match those of ground truth using Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Experimental results demonstrate that our inverse rendering approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, achieving significant improvements in Chamfer Distance and Volume IoU, particularly for high-genus surfaces, while also enhancing surface details for low-genus surfaces.

*Zhongtao Wang,Jiaqi Dai,Qingtian Zhu,Yilong Li,Mai Su,Fei Zhu,Meng Gai,Shaorong Wang,Chengwei Pan,Yisong Chen,Guoping Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChronoGS, a method for reconstructing multi-period scenes tackling challenges in dynamic scenery with geometric and appearance changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in reconstructing multi-period scenes accurately due to the incompatibility of existing methods with long-term, discontinuous changes in geometry and appearance.

Method: ChronoGS employs a temporally modulated Gaussian representation to reconstruct multi-period scenes and disentangles stable and evolving elements for temporal consistency.

Result: ChronoGS achieves better reconstruction quality and temporal consistency than existing methods as demonstrated with experiments on the ChronoScene benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: ChronoGS is an effective framework for reconstructing multi-period scenes, with both its method and released dataset advancing future research.

Abstract: Multi-period image collections are common in real-world applications. Cities are re-scanned for mapping, construction sites are revisited for progress tracking, and natural regions are monitored for environmental change. Such data form multi-period scenes, where geometry and appearance evolve. Reconstructing such scenes is an important yet underexplored problem. Existing pipelines rely on incompatible assumptions: static and in-the-wild methods enforce a single geometry, while dynamic ones assume smooth motion, both failing under long-term, discontinuous changes. To solve this problem, we introduce ChronoGS, a temporally modulated Gaussian representation that reconstructs all periods within a unified anchor scaffold. It's also designed to disentangle stable and evolving components, achieving temporally consistent reconstruction of multi-period scenes. To catalyze relevant research, we release ChronoScene dataset, a benchmark of real and synthetic multi-period scenes, capturing geometric and appearance variation. Experiments demonstrate that ChronoGS consistently outperforms baselines in reconstruction quality and temporal consistency. Our code and the ChronoScene dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/ZhongtaoWang/ChronoGS.

*Austin M. Wallace,C. David Sherrill,Giri P. Krishnan*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine learning framework to predict errors in molecular interaction calculations across various quantum chemical methods, achieving high accuracy and identifying computationally efficient approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address computational challenges in quantum chemical methods to predict molecular interactions due to varying performance and expense between methods.

Method: An ensemble of $Δ$-ML models is used, trained on features from a pre-trained atom-pairwise neural network, allowing error predictions for various levels of quantum chemical methods.

Result: The framework achieves mean absolute errors below 0.1 kcal/mol and identifies efficient computational methods, validated using an extended BioFragment dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances accuracy in identifying molecular interaction errors and demonstrates effective comparison between different chemical methods, confirming $Δ$-ML models’ adaptability.

Abstract: Ab initio quantum chemical methods for accurately computing interactions between molecules have a wide range of applications but are often computationally expensive. Hence, selecting an appropriate method based on accuracy and computational cost remains a significant challenge due to varying performance of methods. In this work, we propose a framework based on an ensemble of $Δ$-ML models trained on features extracted from a pre-trained atom-pairwise neural network to predict the error of each method relative to all other methods including the ``gold standard'' coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations at the estimated complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS]. Our proposed approach provides error estimates across various levels of theories and identifies the computationally efficient approach for a given error range utilizing only a subset of the dataset. Further, this approach allows comparison between various theories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an extended BioFragment dataset, which includes the interaction energies for common biomolecular fragments and small organic dimers. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves very small mean-absolute-errors below 0.1 kcal/mol regardless of the given method. Furthermore, by analyzing all-to-all $Δ$-ML models for present levels of theory, we identify method groupings that align with theoretical hypotheses, providing evidence that $Δ$-ML models can easily learn corrections from any level of theory to any other level of theory.

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: This paper improves portfolio optimization by using the G-Learning algorithm with the GIRL parametric optimization, achieving portfolio growth in volatile markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance portfolio optimization with reinforcement learning in volatile markets to meet investor needs of maximizing value and minimizing contributions.

Method: Utilized G-Learning combined with the GIRL algorithm for dynamic portfolio adjustment to balance diversification, risk, and return optimization.

Result: Sharpe Ratio increased from 0.42 to 0.483, showing improved portfolio performance in comparison to past methods.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning methods like G-Learning provide robust financial portfolio management, even marginally outperforming additional parametric optimizations like GIRL.

Abstract: This research proposes an enhancement to the innovative portfolio optimization approach using the G-Learning algorithm, combined with parametric optimization via the GIRL algorithm (G-learning approach to the setting of Inverse Reinforcement Learning) as presented by. The goal is to maximize portfolio value by a target date while minimizing the investor's periodic contributions. Our model operates in a highly volatile market with a well-diversified portfolio, ensuring a low-risk level for the investor, and leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust portfolio positions over time. Results show that we improved the Sharpe Ratio from 0.42, as suggested by recent studies using the same approach, to a value of 0.483 a notable achievement in highly volatile markets with diversified portfolios. The comparison between G-Learning and GIRL reveals that while GIRL optimizes the reward function parameters (e.g., lambda = 0.0012 compared to 0.002), its impact on portfolio performance remains marginal. This suggests that reinforcement learning methods, like G-Learning, already enable robust optimization. This research contributes to the growing development of reinforcement learning applications in financial decision-making, demonstrating that probabilistic learning algorithms can effectively align portfolio management strategies with investor needs.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for robust inference in linear panel data models with latent group structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Statistical inference becomes challenging in linear panel data models with latent group structures due to group separation concerns and the lack of established distributional properties.

Method: The paper uses selective conditional inference that derives conditional distributions of coefficient estimates given the estimated group structure.

Result: The proposed method shows superior finite-sample performance and valid inference under violations of group separation through Monte Carlo simulations and empirical data applications.

Conclusion: The method improves upon traditional approaches by addressing statistical uncertainties in group structure estimation and is demonstrated to be effective in its claims.

Abstract: This paper presents robust inference methods for general linear hypotheses in linear panel data models with latent group structure in the coefficients. We employ a selective conditional inference approach, deriving the conditional distribution of coefficient estimates given the group structure estimated from the data. Our procedure provides valid inference under possible violations of group separation, where distributional properties of group-specific coefficients remain unestablished. Furthermore, even when group separation does hold, our method demonstrates superior finite-sample properties compared to traditional asymptotic approaches. This improvement stems from our procedure's ability to account for statistical uncertainty in the estimation of group structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through Monte Carlo simulations and apply the methods to two datasets on: (i) the relationship between income and democracy, and (ii) the cyclicality of firm-level R&D investment.

*Xiaohong Chen,Wayne Yuan Gao,Likang Wen*

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method for maximum score estimation using ReLU functions for easier optimization via gradient methods, offering advantages over traditional methods and applicability within a multi-index framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address optimization difficulties in traditional maximum score estimators and extend their utility under multi-dimensional crossing conditions.

Method: The authors replaced indicator functions with ReLU functions in the maximum score estimator, proving its convergence rates and integrating it with deep neural networks.

Result: The proposed estimator achieves better optimization ease, proven convergence rates, asymptotic normality, and applicability to neural network architectures for practical implementation.

Conclusion: The ReLU-based maximum score estimator simplifies optimization, extends the estimator’s application scope, and demonstrates promising theoretical and practical results.

Abstract: We propose a new formulation of the maximum score estimator that uses compositions of rectified linear unit (ReLU) functions, instead of indicator functions as in Manski (1975,1985), to encode the sign alignment restrictions. Since the ReLU function is Lipschitz, our new ReLU-based maximum score criterion function is substantially easier to optimize using standard gradient-based optimization pacakges. We also show that our ReLU-based maximum score (RMS) estimator can be generalized to an umbrella framework defined by multi-index single-crossing (MISC) conditions, while the original maximum score estimator cannot be applied. We establish the $n^{-s/(2s+1)}$ convergence rate and asymptotic normality for the RMS estimator under order-$s$ Holder smoothness. In addition, we propose an alternative estimator using a further reformulation of RMS as a special layer in a deep neural network (DNN) architecture, which allows the estimation procedure to be implemented via state-of-the-art software and hardware for DNN.

TL;DR: This paper explores the AURA framework that integrates LLMs for strategic planning with MARL agents at base stations for handling NextG cellular networks efficiently while minimizing latency and enhancing adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for managing dynamic traffic in NextG cellular networks while overcoming the limitations of latency and computational cost of LLMs and coordination challenges in MARL.

Method: AURA integrates LLMs for cloud-based high-level planning with MARL agents at base stations for local decision-making. It employs a trust mechanism and batched communication to enhance coordination and efficiency while reducing latency.

Result: In a 6G simulation, AURA significantly reduces dropped handoff requests, lowers system failures, and successfully balances local adaptability with external guidance.

Conclusion: Combining LLM reasoning with MARL adaptability offers scalable and real-time management solutions for NextG network challenges, proving effective in simulation scenarios.

Abstract: Next-generation (NextG) cellular networks are expected to manage dynamic traffic while sustaining high performance. Large language models (LLMs) provide strategic reasoning for 6G planning, but their computational cost and latency limit real-time use. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) supports localized adaptation, yet coordination at scale remains challenging. We present AURA, a framework that integrates cloud-based LLMs for high-level planning with base stations modeled as MARL agents for local decision-making. The LLM generates objectives and subgoals from its understanding of the environment and reasoning capabilities, while agents at base stations execute these objectives autonomously, guided by a trust mechanism that balances local learning with external input. To reduce latency, AURA employs batched communication so that agents update the LLM's view of the environment and receive improved feedback. In a simulated 6G scenario, AURA improves resilience, reducing dropped handoff requests by more than half under normal and high traffic and lowering system failures. Agents use LLM input in fewer than 60\% of cases, showing that guidance augments rather than replaces local adaptability, thereby mitigating latency and hallucination risks. These results highlight the promise of combining LLM reasoning with MARL adaptability for scalable, real-time NextG network management.

Motivation: The opacity of AI decisions in crucial domains such as healthcare and robotics poses risks. The paper aims to ensure transparency and reliability in mission-critical AI-adopted communication networks.

Method: A mathematical framework is devised to analyze the balance between transparency (e.g., fairness, explanation fidelity), latency, and hardware efficiency (e.g., GPU utilization). The hybrid 'xAI-Native' model is proposed and evaluated against baseline models.

Result: Empirical results highlight that xAI-Native surpasses conventional models across key metrics, demonstrating improved reliability and performance.

Conclusion: Transparent and trustworthy AI, enabled by hybrid models like xAI-Native, is essential for mission-critical applications in modern 5G/6G networks serving industries with stringent demands.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-native radio access networks (RANs) will serve vertical industries with stringent requirements: smart grids, autonomous vehicles, remote healthcare, industrial automation, etc. To achieve these requirements, modern 5G/6G design increasingly leverage AI for network optimization, but the opacity of AI decisions poses risks in mission-critical domains. These use cases are often delivered via non-public networks (NPNs) or dedicated network slices, where reliability and safety are vital. In this paper, we motivate the need for transparent and trustworthy AI in high-stakes communications (e.g., healthcare, industrial automation, and robotics) by drawing on 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP)'s vision for non-public networks. We design a mathematical framework to model the trade-offs between transparency (explanation fidelity and fairness), latency, and graphics processing unit (GPU) utilization in deploying explainable AI (XAI) models. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid XAI model xAI-Native, consistently surpasses conventional baseline models in performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAJD, a framework for detecting jamming attacks in AI/ML-based O-RAN environments using real-time ML models that adapt to dynamic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the rising threat of jamming attacks in O-RAN networks, which compromise their performance, security, and reliability.

Method: Development of the SAJD framework that combines ML-based xApps and rApps for jamming detection, leveraging real-time inference, continuous monitoring, and adaptive retraining pipelines using live telemetry.

Result: SAJD demonstrated superior accuracy and adaptability when compared to state-of-the-art jamming detection approaches, particularly in dynamic and previously unseen interference scenarios, as validated on an O-RAN-compliant testbed.

Conclusion: SAJD is effective in enhancing the security and reliability of O-RAN networks with its self-adaptive, real-time, and closed-loop detection mechanism for jamming attacks.

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), and implementation of standardized open interfaces. It also facilitates closed loop control and (non/near) real-time optimization of radio access network (RAN) through the integration of non-real-time applications (rApps) and near-real-time applications (xApps). However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN that can severely undermine network performance and subject it to a prominent threat to the security & reliability of O-RAN networks is jamming attacks. To address this, we introduce SAJD-a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects jamming attacks in artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML)-integrated O-RAN environments. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes near-real-time inference of radio signal jamming interference via our developed ML-based xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps. Specifically, a labeler rApp is developed that uses live telemetry (i.e., KPIs) to detect model drift, triggers unsupervised data labeling, executes model training/retraining using the integrated & open-source ClearML framework, and updates deployed models on the fly, without service disruption. Experiments on O-RAN-compliant testbed demonstrate that the SAJD framework outperforms state-of-the-art (offline-trained with manual labels) jamming detection approach in accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen interference scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper presents a crop protection model using Wireless Sensor Networks and a Repelling and Notifying System that generates ultrasonic sounds to deter animals and birds while notifying farmers about field intrusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Farmers face significant challenges in protecting their crops from animals and birds both before and after harvest. This paper aims to address this issue with a low-cost, power-efficient solution.

Method: The proposed method installs sensor nodes around fields to detect animals or birds. The detected signals are transmitted via ZigBee wireless technology to a Repelling and Notifying System (RNS). The RNS emits ultrasonic sounds to repel animals and sends SMS notifications to farmers.

Result: The system effectively identifies and deters animals and birds without human intervention, while also informing farmers through SMS. The design is cost-effective and energy-efficient.

Conclusion: This low-cost, power-saving system can significantly improve crop protection in developing countries by reducing the need for constant human intervention while effectively deterring animals and birds.

Abstract: One of the main problems for farmers is the protection of their crops, before and after harvesting, from animals and birds. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a model of safe farming in which the crops will be protected from vertebrates attack through a prevention system that is based on Wirelesses Sensors Networks. Different sensor nodes are placed around the field that detect animals or birds existence and generate required signals and information. This information is passed to the Repelling and Notifying System (RNS) that is installed at the field through a short range wireless technology, ZigBee. As RNS receives the information, it generates ultrasonic sounds that are unbearable for animals and birds, which causes them to run away from the field. These ultrasonic sounds are generated in a frequency range that only animals and birds can hear, while humans cannot notice the sound. The paper also proposes a notifying system. It will inform the farmer about animals or birds intrusion in the field through SMS, but doesn't need any action from the farmer. The low cost and power efficiency of the proposed system is a key advantage for developing countries where cost and power are major players in any system feasibility.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel spatio-temporal task in radio map prediction, introduces a new dataset named RadioMapMotion, and proposes a deep learning model, RadioLSTM, for accurate and real-time predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to account for the temporal continuity in dynamic environments, leading to the need for a predictive approach to model changes in signal propagation caused by moving entities.

Method: The authors created a novel dataset, RadioMapMotion, of continuous RM sequences and proposed RadioLSTM, a UNet-based architecture leveraging ConvLSTM for multi-step spatio-temporal radio map forecasting.

Result: RadioLSTM outperformed baseline methods in terms of prediction accuracy, structural fidelity, and inference latency, demonstrating suitability for real-time network applications.

Conclusion: Spatio-temporal radio map prediction is feasible with the proposed method and dataset, achieving superior performance and highlighting its importance for 6G network planning and operations.

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs), which provide location-based pathloss estimations, are fundamental to enabling proactive, environment-aware communication in 6G networks. However, existing deep learning-based methods for RM construction often model dynamic environments as a series of independent static snapshots, thereby omitting the temporal continuity inherent in signal propagation changes caused by the motion of dynamic entities. To address this limitation, we propose the task of spatio-temporal RM prediction, which involves forecasting a sequence of future maps from historical observations. A key barrier to this predictive approach has been the lack of datasets capturing continuous environmental evolution. To fill this gap, we introduce RadioMapMotion, the first large-scale public dataset of continuous RM sequences generated from physically consistent vehicle trajectories. As a baseline for this task, we propose RadioLSTM, a UNet architecture based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) and designed for multi-step sequence forecasting. Experimental evaluations show that RadioLSTM achieves higher prediction accuracy and structural fidelity compared to representative baseline methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits a low inference latency, indicating its potential suitability for real-time network operations. Our project will be publicly released at: https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/RadioMapMotion upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: The energy sector needs AI systems capable of operating autonomously even during network failures, which cloud-centric architectures cannot achieve.

Method: The study evaluates DFC-AI, a hybrid edge-cloud architecture employing microservices across computational devices, through simulations of energy sector scenarios.

Result: DFC-AI ensures operational continuity during network outages, reduces latency and energy consumption, and is cost-efficient compared to gateway and cloud-based solutions.

Conclusion: DFC-AI effectively addresses the energy sector's automation needs, proving its utility in remote and challenging environments through its resilience, cost savings, and efficiency.

Abstract: Industrial automation in the energy sector requires AI systems that can operate autonomously regardless of network availability, a requirement that cloud-centric architectures cannot meet. This paper evaluates the application of Device-First Continuum AI (DFC-AI) to critical energy sector operations. DFC-AI, a specialized architecture within the Hybrid Edge Cloud paradigm, implements intelligent agents using a microservices architecture that originates at end devices and extends across the computational continuum. Through comprehensive simulations of energy sector scenarios including drone inspections, sensor networks, and worker safety systems, we demonstrate that DFC-AI maintains full operational capability during network outages while cloud and gateway-based systems experience complete or partial failure. Our analysis reveals that zero-configuration GPU discovery and heterogeneous device clustering are particularly well-suited for energy sector deployments, where specialized nodes can handle intensive AI workloads for entire fleets of inspection drones or sensor networks. The evaluation shows that DFC-AI achieves significant latency reduction and energy savings compared to cloud architectures. Additionally, we find that gateway based edge solutions can paradoxically cost more than cloud solutions for certain energy sector workloads due to infrastructure overhead, while DFC-AI can consistently provide cost savings by leveraging enterprise-owned devices. These findings, validated through rigorous statistical analysis, establish that DFC-AI addresses the unique challenges of energy sector operations, ensuring intelligent agents remain available and functional in remote oil fields, offshore platforms, and other challenging environments characteristic of the industry.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ZoomDiff, a diffusion-based model for multi-scale mobile network traffic generation, achieving notable improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with generating network traffic at multiple spatiotemporal resolutions, hindering effective planning and management.

Method: ZoomDiff utilizes Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models (DRDM) that map urban context into traffic layers with various resolutions through multi-stage noise-adding and denoising.

Result: ZoomDiff shows at least an 18.4% performance improvement over state-of-the-art benchmarks in multi-scale traffic generation tasks.

Conclusion: ZoomDiff demonstrates efficiency and strong generalization potential, paving the way for advanced multi-layer mobile data generative tasks.

Abstract: Multi-layer mobile network traffic generation is a key approach to capturing multi-scale network dynamics, supporting network planning, and promoting generative management of mobile data. Existing methods focus on generating network traffic with a single spatiotemporal resolution, making it difficult to achieve joint generation of multi-scale traffic. In this paper, we propose ZoomDiff, a diffusion-based multi-scale mobile traffic generation model. ZoomDiff maps the urban environmental context into network traffic with multiple spatiotemporal resolutions through custom-designed Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models (DRDM). DRDM employs a multi-stage noise-adding and denoising process, enabling different stages to generate traffic with distinct spatial and temporal resolutions. It aligns the progressive denoising process of diffusion models with hierarchical network layers, including BSs, cells, and grids with different granularities. Evaluations on real-world mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ZoomDiff achieves a performance improvement of at least 18.4% over state-of-the-art baselines on generation tasks at multi-scale traffic. The efficiency and generalization ability are also demonstrated, which indicates that ZoomDiff holds strong potential for generative mobile data management.

TL;DR: HiFiNet is a novel hierarchical fault identification framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), leveraging LSTMs and GATs to enhance fault detection accuracy and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fault detection in WSN struggles with balancing accuracy and energy efficiency and often fails to utilize the spatio-temporal correlations in sensor data.

Method: HiFiNet employs a two-stage process: an LSTM stacked autoencoder for temporal extraction and initial classification, followed by a Graph Attention Network to refine results by leveraging spatial topology.

Result: HiFiNet outperforms existing methods in accuracy, F1-score, and precision on datasets, proving its robustness and effectiveness in detecting various faults.

Conclusion: HiFiNet effectively improves fault detection in WSN while balancing diagnostic performance and energy efficiency, and it's adaptable to various operational needs.

Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are the backbone of essential monitoring applications, but their deployment in unfavourable conditions increases the risk to data integrity and system reliability. Traditional fault detection methods often struggle to effectively balance accuracy and energy consumption, and they may not fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal correlations inherent in WSN data. In this paper, we introduce HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical fault identification framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage process. Firstly, edge classifiers with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) stacked autoencoder perform temporal feature extraction and output initial fault class prediction for individual sensor nodes. Using these results, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) then aggregates information from neighboring nodes to refine the classification by integrating the topology context. Our method is able to produce more accurate predictions by capturing both local temporal patterns and network-wide spatial dependencies. To validate this approach, we constructed synthetic WSN datasets by introducing specific, predefined faults into the Intel Lab Dataset and NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis data. Experimental results demonstrate that HiFiNet significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy, F1-score, and precision, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in identifying diverse fault types. Furthermore, the framework's design allows for a tunable trade-off between diagnostic performance and energy efficiency, making it adaptable to different operational requirements.

Method: The authors propose a new web architecture where servers provide semantic chunks of information and introduce a Web-native semantic resolver to enable more efficient information discovery and retrieval for AI systems.

Result: Motivational experiments highlight inefficiencies in the current HTML-based retrieval system, underscoring the need for change.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes evolving the web to support a semantic, AI-oriented infrastructure, presenting architectural directions and the challenges associated with this transformation.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI Search is fundamentally transforming how users and intelligent systems interact with the Internet. LLMs increasingly act as intermediaries between humans and web information. Yet the web remains optimized for human browsing rather than AI-driven semantic retrieval, resulting in wasted network bandwidth, lower information quality, and unnecessary complexity for developers. We introduce the concept of an AI-Native Internet, a web architecture in which servers expose semantically relevant information chunks rather than full documents, supported by a Web-native semantic resolver that allows AI applications to discover relevant information sources before retrieving fine-grained chunks. Through motivational experiments, we quantify the inefficiencies of current HTML-based retrieval, and outline architectural directions and open challenges for evolving today's document-centric web into an AI-oriented substrate that better supports semantic access to web content.

*Chenhua Shi,Joji Philip,Subhadip Bandyopadhyay,Jayanta Choudhury*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper presents an AI/ML pipeline to detect root causes and event sequences leading to SLA breaches in RAN for proactive fault management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve fault management in Radio Access Networks by identifying SLA breach causes and sequences proactively, preventing customer impact.

Method: The method involves labeling network data as 'normal' or 'abnormal' and using a model to learn causal chains leading to faults. Monte Carlo tests validate its precision and scalability.

Result: The model accurately identifies root-cause trigger sequences and scales efficiently for large data sizes in RAN networks.

Conclusion: The system enables proactive fault management by providing high-resolution insights, offering a shift from reactive to proactive SLA management strategies.

Abstract: To keep modern Radio Access Networks (RAN) running smoothly, operators need to spot the real-world triggers behind Service-Level Agreement (SLA) breaches well before customers feel them. We introduce an AI/ML pipeline that does two things most tools miss: (1) finds the likely root-cause indicators and (2) reveals the exact order in which those events unfold. We start by labeling network data: records linked to past SLA breaches are marked `abnormal', and everything else `normal'. Our model then learns the causal chain that turns normal behavior into a fault. In Monte Carlo tests the approach pinpoints the correct trigger sequence with high precision and scales to millions of data points without loss of speed. These results show that high-resolution, causally ordered insights can move fault management from reactive troubleshooting to proactive prevention.

### [906] [DyPBP: Dynamic Peer Beneficialness Prediction for Cryptocurrency P2P Networking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17523)
*Nazmus Sakib,Simeon Wuthier,Amanul Islam,Xiaobo Zhou,Jinoh Kim,Ikkyun Kim,Sang-Yoon Chang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dynamic Peer Beneficialness Prediction (DyPBP), a model designed to predict the usefulness of peer connections in Bitcoin networks before blocks/transactions are delivered.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in cryptocurrency P2P networks where poor connectivity affects mining rewards and to improve predictions regarding beneficial peer connections despite limited interaction data.

Method: The authors developed DyPBP, implementing it on an active Bitcoin node on the Mainnet. DyPBP uses networking behaviors, introduces a remembrance feature to handle dynamic connectivity issues, and applies machine learning to predict the beneficialness of connections.

Result: Experimental results show that DyPBP improves prediction errors by 2 to 13 orders of magnitude depending on the machine-learning model used.

Conclusion: DyPBP can estimate the beneficialness of P2P connections right from connection initiation, overcoming connectivity and data limitations, and highlights the importance of the remembrance feature in improving its effectiveness.

Abstract: Distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) networking delivers the new blocks and transactions and is critical for the cryptocurrency blockchain system operations. Having poor P2P connectivity reduces the financial rewards from the mining consensus protocol. Previous research defines beneficalness of each Bitcoin peer connection and estimates the beneficialness based on the observations of the blocks and transactions delivery, which are after they are delivered. However, due to the infrequent block arrivals and the sporadic and unstable peer connections, the peers do not stay connected long enough to have the beneficialness score to converge to its expected beneficialness. We design and build Dynamic Peer Beneficialness Prediction (DyPBP) which predicts a peer's beneficialness by using networking behavior observations beyond just the block and transaction arrivals. DyPBP advances the previous research by estimating the beneficialness of a peer connection before it delivers new blocks and transactions. To achieve such goal, DyPBP introduces a new feature for remembrance to address the dynamic connectivity issue, as Bitcoin's peers using distributed networking often disconnect and re-connect. We implement DyPBP on an active Bitcoin node connected to the Mainnet and use machine learning for the beneficialness prediction. Our experimental results validate and evaluate the effectiveness of DyPBP; for example, the error performance improves by 2 to 13 orders of magnitude depending on the machine-learning model selection. DyPBP's use of the remembrance feature also informs our model selection. DyPBP enables the P2P connection's beneficialness estimation from the connection start before a new block arrives.

Method: A Q-learning framework using Markov Decision Process (MDP) with hashed state models to unify scheduling and aggregation tree construction.

Result: The proposed method shows up to 10.87% lower latency compared to existing heuristic algorithms in static networks with up to 300 nodes.

Conclusion: The approach is robust and promotes scalable, low-latency data aggregation for time-sensitive IoT applications, offering timely insights for environments like smart cities and industrial automation.

Abstract: Time-critical data aggregation in Internet of Things (IoT) networks demands efficient, collision-free scheduling to minimize latency for applications like smart cities and industrial automation. Traditional heuristic methods, with two-phase tree construction and scheduling, often suffer from high computational overhead and suboptimal delays due to their static nature. To address this, we propose a novel Q-learning framework that unifies aggregation tree construction and scheduling, modeling the process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with hashed states for scalability. By leveraging a reward function that promotes large, interference-free batch transmissions, our approach dynamically learns optimal scheduling policies. Simulations on static networks with up to 300 nodes demonstrate up to 10.87% lower latency compared to a state-of-the-art heuristic algorithm, highlighting its robustness for delay-sensitive IoT applications. This framework enables timely insights in IoT environments, paving the way for scalable, low-latency data aggregation.

### [908] [LLM-Based Agentic Negotiation for 6G: Addressing Uncertainty Neglect and Tail-Event Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19175)
*Hatim Chergui,Farhad Rezazadeh,Mehdi Bennis,Merouane Debbah*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper addresses trust issues in 6G networks by proposing a risk-aware framework using Digital Twins and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to mitigate uncertainty and reduce extreme latency while maintaining robust resource allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the trust gap caused by uncertainty neglect bias in Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents in 6G networks. The paper aims to address the cognitive bias leading to poor high-stakes decision-making and ensure robust and trustworthy autonomous systems.

Method: The framework uses Digital Twins to predict latency distributions and evaluates with CVaR to shift decision-making to focus on tail risks. It also quantifies epistemic uncertainty, adding robustness to agent decisions.

Result: In a 6G network slicing scenario, the CVaR-informed approach eliminated SLA violations and reduced p99.999 latencies by 11%, albeit at a quantifiable cost of slightly reduced energy savings to 17%.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates a practical and statistically rigorous solution for ensuring trustworthiness in autonomous 6G systems by addressing uncertainty neglect bias. It highlights the trade-off between reliability and energy efficiency as a rational cost for robust decision-making.

Abstract: A critical barrier to the trustworthiness of sixth-generation (6G) agentic autonomous networks is the uncertainty neglect bias; a cognitive tendency for large language model (LLM)-powered agents to make high-stakes decisions based on simple averages while ignoring the tail risk of extreme events. This paper proposes an unbiased, risk-aware framework for agentic negotiation, designed to ensure robust resource allocation in 6G network slicing. Specifically, agents leverage Digital Twins (DTs) to predict full latency distributions, which are then evaluated using a formal framework from extreme value theory, namely, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). This approach fundamentally shifts the agent's objective from reasoning over the mean to reasoning over the tail, thereby building a statistically-grounded buffer against worst-case outcomes. Furthermore, our framework ensures full uncertainty awareness by requiring agents to quantify epistemic uncertainty -- confidence in their own DTs predictions -- and propagate this meta-verification to make robust decisions, preventing them from acting on unreliable data. We validate this framework in a 6G inter-slice negotiation use-case between an eMBB and a URLLC agent. The results demonstrate the profound failure of the biased, mean-based baseline, which consistently fails its SLAs with a 25\% rate. Our unbiased, CVaR-aware agent successfully mitigates this bias, eliminating SLA violations and reducing the URLLC and eMBB p99.999 latencies by around 11\%. We show this reliability comes at the rational and quantifiable cost of slightly reduced energy savings to 17\%, exposing the false economy of the biased approach. This work provides a concrete methodology for building the trustworthy autonomous systems required for 6G.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a groundwork for using genetic algorithms in quantum architecture search, paving the way for automated, adaptable techniques applicable to diverse data types and hardware constraints.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have driven advances in domains such as image classification, speech recognition, and anomaly detection by leveraging multi-layer neural networks to model complex data. Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters.
  This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era. Our approach lays a foundation for broader application of genetic algorithms to quantum architecture search, aiming for a robust, automated method that can adapt to varied data and hardware constraints.

*Georgios Maragkopoulos,Lazaros Chavatzoglou,Aikaterini Mandilara,Dimitris Syvridis*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a single-qudit quantum neural network (QNN) for credit risk assessment, combining interpretability and performance on imbalanced financial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop interpretable and accurate predictive models for critical applications like credit risk assessment, addressing challenges posed by traditional machine learning models.

Method: A single-qudit QNN is employed, co-encoding data features and trainable parameters into unitary evolution. The model explores Hilbert space fully and introduces interpretability via learned coefficients. Novel interpretability metrics (edit distance and feature-poisoning) assess the solution.

Result: The QNN achieves better results than logistic regression (LR) and matches random forest models in macro-F1 scores on a credit-risk dataset, with an interpretable link between feature importance and learned parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed QNN delivers competitive performance with improved interpretability, marking progress toward transparent quantum learning models.

Abstract: In finance, predictive models must balance accuracy and interpretability, particularly in credit risk assessment, where model decisions carry material consequences. We present a quantum neural network (QNN) based on a single qudit, in which both data features and trainable parameters are co-encoded within a unified unitary evolution generated by the full Lie algebra. This design explores the entire Hilbert space while enabling interpretability through the magnitudes of the learned coefficients. We benchmark our model on a real-world, imbalanced credit-risk dataset from Taiwan. The proposed QNN consistently outperforms LR and reaches the results of random forest models in macro-F1 score while preserving a transparent correspondence between learned parameters and input feature importance. To quantify the interpretability of the proposed model, we introduce two complementary metrics: (i) the edit distance between the model's feature ranking and that of LR, and (ii) a feature-poisoning test where selected features are replaced with noise. Results indicate that the proposed quantum model achieves competitive performance while offering a tractable path toward interpretable quantum learning.

TL;DR: This paper formulates standards and risk bounds for Quantum Neural Estimators (QNEs) to measure quantum entropies and divergences accurately, exhibiting sub-Gaussian error concentration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges of estimating quantum entropies and divergences in quantum physics, information theory, and machine learning, and provide a more principled framework for QNE implementation.

Method: The paper derives non-asymptotic error bounds, exponential tail bounds, and copy complexity for QNEs using mathematical tools. It also considers permutation-invariant density operators to improve dependence on dimensionality.

Result: Results include sub-Gaussian error concentration about the true value, risk bounds, and improved scaling for QNEs in certain specialized instances, such as permutation-invariant settings.

Conclusion: The research provides theoretical guarantees for QNEs, aiding their principled implementation and guiding hyperparameter optimization in estimating measured relative entropies.

Abstract: Estimating quantum entropies and divergences is an important problem in quantum physics, information theory, and machine learning. Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures. Such estimators combine classical neural networks with parametrized quantum circuits, and their deployment typically entails tedious tuning of hyperparameters controlling the sample size, network architecture, and circuit topology. This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (Rényi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|Θ(\mathcal{U})|d/ε^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $Θ(\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $ε$. Additionally, if the density operator pairs are permutation invariant, we improve the dimension dependence above to $O(|Θ(\mathcal{U})|\mathrm{polylog}(d)/ε^2)$. Our theory aims to facilitate principled implementation of QNEs for measured relative entropies and guide hyperparameter tuning in practice.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Cantor-Kantorovich (CK) distance for comparing Labeled Markov Chains (LMCs), discussing its computational complexity, continuity, and approximation properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the necessity of assessing the accuracy of abstractions or quantifying model perturbations in probabilistic languages represented by Labeled Markov Chains.

Method: The researchers framed CK distance as a discounted sum of finite-horizon Total Variation distances, analyzed its computational complexity (#P-hardness), continuity properties, and provided a computable approximation scheme.

Result: The study revealed that exact computation of CK distance is #P-hard and established its upper bound in terms of approximation. It also demonstrated that bounded CK distance implies bounded error in finite-horizon probabilities, and developed a computable approximation method which is also #P-hard.

Conclusion: CK distance provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for comparing LMCs, clarifying its relationship with existing approaches and advancing understanding of its properties in terms of complexity and approximation.

Abstract: Labeled Markov Chains (or LMCs for short) are useful mathematical objects to model complex probabilistic languages. A central challenge is to compare two LMCs, for example to assess the accuracy of an abstraction or to quantify the effect of model perturbations. In this work, we study the recently introduced Cantor-Kantorovich (or CK) distance. In particular we show that the latter can be framed as a discounted sum of finite-horizon Total Variation distances, making it an instance of discounted linear distance, but arising from the natural Cantor topology. Building on the latter observation, we analyze the properties of the CK distance along three dimensions: computational complexity, continuity properties and approximation. More precisely, we show that the exact computation of the CK distance is #P-hard. We also provide an upper bound on the CK distance as a function of the approximation relation between the two LMCs, and show that a bounded CK distance implies a bounded error between probabilities of finite-horizon traces. Finally, we provide a computable approximation scheme, and show that the latter is also #P-hard. Altogether, our results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the CK distance and clarify its relationship with existing distances.

### [914] [Ternary Gamma Semirings as a Novel Algebraic Framework for Learnable Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17728)
*Chandrasekhar Gokavarapu,D. Madhusudhana Rao*

Main category: math.RA

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Neural Ternary Semiring (NTS), an algebraic framework to naturally handle triadic relationships in reasoning tasks, avoiding limitations of binary interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current algebraic models like binary semirings are limited to pairwise interactions, but many AI tasks inherently involve triadic relationships. Traditional approaches flatten these interactions into binary forms, reducing structure and interpretability.

Method: A new ternary semiring framework (Neural Ternary Semiring or NTS) is proposed, replacing binary operations with a ternary operator executed via neural networks and constrained by algebraic regularizers to ensure its validity.

Result: The approach ensures convergence to a valid ternary Gamma-semiring when algebraic violations diminish during training and is designed for applications in triadic reasoning tasks like knowledge-graph completion.

Conclusion: Ternary Gamma-semirings provide a rigorous and effective basis for modeling direct triadic relationships, addressing limitations in current symbolic reasoning systems.

Abstract: Binary semirings such as the tropical, log, and probability semirings form a core algebraic tool in classical and modern neural inference systems, supporting tasks like Viterbi decoding, dynamic programming, and probabilistic reasoning. However, these structures rely on a binary multiplication operator and therefore model only pairwise interactions. Many symbolic AI tasks are inherently triadic, including subject-predicate-object relations in knowledge graphs, logical rules involving two premises and one conclusion, and multi-entity dependencies in structured decision processes. Existing neural architectures usually approximate these interactions by flattening or factorizing them into binary components, which weakens inductive structure, distorts relational meaning, and reduces interpretability.
  This paper introduces the Neural Ternary Semiring (NTS), a learnable and differentiable algebraic framework grounded in the theory of ternary Gamma-semirings. The central idea is to replace the usual binary product with a native ternary operator implemented by neural networks and guided by algebraic regularizers enforcing approximate associativity and distributivity. This construction allows triadic relationships to be represented directly rather than reconstructed from binary interactions.
  We establish a soundness result showing that, when algebraic violations vanish during training, the learned operator converges to a valid ternary Gamma-semiring. We also outline an evaluation strategy for triadic reasoning tasks such as knowledge-graph completion and rule-based inference. These insights demonstrate that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a mathematically principled and practically effective foundation for learnable symbolic reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to study and demonstrate information-computation gaps in statistical problems by establishing stronger sample complexity lower bounds against computational models, specifically for the more natural and stronger class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests.

Method: The authors leverage connections to pseudorandom generator work and novel technical tools, such as structural results for low-degree polynomials restricted to random directions, in order to prove lower bounds for PTF tests.

Result: The paper demonstrates the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for statistical problems, including a near-optimal bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA), which further applies to other statistical tasks.

Conclusion: This work improves the understanding of computational limitations within statistical frameworks and provides a foundation for further advancements in analyzing PTF tests and their applications in statistical problems.

Abstract: This work studies information-computation gaps for statistical problems. A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature.
  In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context. At the technical level, we develop several tools of independent interest, including novel structural results for analyzing the behavior of low-degree polynomials restricted to random directions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Online Smoothed Demand Management (OSDM) problem for energy decision-making and presents both a competitive algorithm, PAAD, and a novel learning framework for balancing robustness and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paradigm shifts in energy grid integration and energy storage for large consumers like data centers inspired the need for effective and healthy energy decision-making systems.

Method: The paper develops a competitive algorithm, PAAD, and proposes a learning framework blending worst-case guarantees with end-to-end differentiable learning techniques to optimize energy management.

Result: The proposed PAAD algorithm achieves optimal competitive ratios in managing energy decisions, while the learning framework demonstrates substantial performance improvements over PAAD in historical analysis.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses online energy management challenges and showcases the potential of combining algorithmic robustness with learning-based adaptability for improving grid-integrated operations.

Abstract: We introduce and study a class of online problems called online smoothed demand management $(\texttt{OSDM})$, motivated by paradigm shifts in grid integration and energy storage for large energy consumers such as data centers. In $\texttt{OSDM}$, an operator makes two decisions at each time step: an amount of energy to be purchased, and an amount of energy to be delivered (i.e., used for computation). The difference between these decisions charges (or discharges) the operator's energy storage (e.g., a battery). Two types of demand arrive online: base demand, which must be covered at the current time, and flexible demand, which can be satisfied at any time steps before a demand-specific deadline $Δ_t$. The operator's goal is to minimize a cost (subject to the constraints above) that combines a cost of purchasing energy, a cost for delivering energy (if applicable), and smoothness penalties on the purchasing and delivery rates to discourage fluctuations and encourage ``grid healthy'' decisions. $\texttt{OSDM}$ generalizes several problems in the online algorithms literature while being the first to fully model applications of interest. We propose a competitive algorithm called $\texttt{PAAD}$ (partitioned accounting \& aggregated decisions) and show it achieves the optimal competitive ratio. To overcome the pessimism typical of worst-case analysis, we also propose a novel learning framework that provides guarantees on the worst-case competitive ratio (i.e., to provide robustness against nonstationarity) while allowing end-to-end differentiable learning of the best algorithm on historical instances of the problem. We evaluate our algorithms in a case study of a grid-integrated data center with battery storage, showing that $\texttt{PAAD}$ effectively solves the problem and end-to-end learning achieves substantial performance improvements compared to $\texttt{PAAD}$.

Method: ECOSAIC, a customizable autoencoder, compresses n-dimensional feature spaces by optimizing domain-informed biogeochemical and hydrogeomorphological features, integrating multiple ecological aspects.

Result: Application of ECOSAIC identified 16 benthic habitats in the Colombian Pacific Ocean, showing strong ecological associations between environmental constraints and species composition.

Conclusion: This framework enhances marine planning, biodiversity conservation, and fish stock assessment while offering insights into integrating ecological principles into AI, overcoming data limitations.

Abstract: Benthic habitat is challenging due to the environmental complexity of the seafloor, technological limitations, and elevated operational costs, especially in under-explored regions. This generates knowledge gaps for the sustainable management of hydrobiological resources and their nexus with society. We developed ECOSAIC (Ecological Compression via Orthogonal Specialized Autoencoders for Interpretable Classification), an Artificial Intelligence framework for automatic classification of benthic habitats through interpretable latent representations using a customizable autoencoder. ECOSAIC compresses n-dimensional feature space by optimizing specialization and orthogonality between domain-informed features. We employed two domain-informed categories: biogeochemical and hydrogeomorphological, that together integrate biological, physicochemical, hydrological and geomorphological, features, whose constraints on habitats have been recognized in ecology for a century. We applied the model to the Colombian Pacific Ocean and the results revealed 16 benthic habitats, expanding from mangroves to deep rocky areas up to 1000 m depth. The candidate habitats exhibited a strong correspondence between their environmental constraints, represented in latent space, and their expected species composition. This correspondence reflected meaningful ecological associations rather than purely statistical correlations, where the habitat's environmental offerings align semantically with the species' requirements. This approach could improve the management and conservation of benthic habitats, facilitating the development of functional maps that support marine planning, biodiversity conservation and fish stock assessment. We also hope it provides new insights into how ecological principles can inform AI frameworks, particularly given the substantial data limitations that characterize ecological research.

*Juvenal Bassa,Arghya Chattopadhyay,Sudhir Malik,Mario Escabi Rivera*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: Simulation-driven Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) using Machine Learning (ML) in particle physics experiments is proposed to improve anomaly detection and reduce human error. MEDIC, a neural network, is introduced for detecting and localizing detector faults, showing promising results for future development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in DQM arise from extreme conditions, data volumes, and detector complexity in particle physics experiments, necessitating new approaches like Machine Learning (ML).

Method: A simulation-driven approach using modified Delphes is employed, where the MEDIC neural network is developed to detect and localize detector faults.

Result: The initial implementation mimics detector faults using simulation, showcasing MEDIC's capability to learn detector behavior and identify anomalies.

Conclusion: Simulation-driven studies with ML show promise for establishing advanced, data-driven DQM frameworks for future particle detectors.

Abstract: Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) is a crucial component of particle physics experiments and ensures that the recorded data is of the highest quality, and suitable for subsequent physics analysis. Due to the extreme environmental conditions, unprecedented data volumes, and the sheer scale and complexity of the detectors, DQM orchestration has become a very challenging task. Therefore, the use of Machine Learning (ML) to automate anomaly detection, improve efficiency, and reduce human error in the process of collecting high-quality data is unavoidable. Since DQM relies on real experimental data, it is inherently tied to the specific detector substructure and technology in operation. In this work, a simulation-driven approach to DQM is proposed, enabling the study and development of data-quality methodologies in a controlled environment. Using a modified version of Delphes -- a fast, multi-purpose detector simulation -- the preliminary realization of a framework is demonstrated which leverages ML to identify detector anomalies as well as localize the malfunctioning components responsible. We introduce MEDIC (Monitoring for Event Data Integrity and Consistency), a neural network designed to learn detector behavior and perform DQM tasks to look for potential faults. Although the present implementation adopts a simplified setup for computational ease, where large detector regions are deliberately deactivated to mimic faults, this work represents an initial step toward a comprehensive ML-based DQM framework. The encouraging results underline the potential of simulation-driven studies as a foundation for developing more advanced, data-driven DQM systems for future particle detectors.

*Iván Mozún Mateo*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: This research integrates knowledge of the KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescope's physics and detector design into transformer models to improve deep learning-based reconstruction capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescope's current setup limits reconstruction efficiency, and deep learning models usually lack explicit understanding of physics and detector design.

Method: Attention masks inspired by neutrino physics and telescope design are introduced into transformers, enabling fine-tuning across detector configurations.

Result: The study demonstrates that incorporating these attention masks allows transformers to handle information effectively and improve performance across different telescope configurations.

Conclusion: This paper highlights transformers as an efficient tool for enhancing the detector's interpretative power and performance using physics-informed techniques.

Abstract: The current KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescope, still under construction, has not yet reached its full potential in neutrino reconstruction capability. When training any deep learning model, no explicit information about the physics or the detector is provided, thus they remain unknown to the model. This study leverages the strengths of transformers by incorporating attention masks inspired by the physics and detector design, making the model understand both the telescope design and the neutrino physics measured on it. The study also shows the efficacy of transformers on retaining valuable information between detectors when doing fine-tuning from one configurations to another.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decision support framework using Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning to efficiently manage epidemics by balancing disease control with socio-economic costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a framework that improves epidemic interventions by reducing healthcare strain and socio-economic burdens during pandemics.

Method: Combines compartmental epidemic models, Bayesian inference, and RL controllers. Policies are tested using COVID-19 ICU data from England for effectiveness in epidemic control.

Result: RL policies outperformed historical government strategies, substantially reducing ICU burden over 300 days.

Conclusion: Bayesian sequential learning and reinforcement learning provide effective decision support tools for epidemic policy design and implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a real time, data driven decision support framework for epidemic control. We combine a compartmental epidemic model with sequential Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning (RL) controllers that adaptively choose intervention levels to balance disease burden, such as intensive care unit (ICU) load, against socio economic costs. We construct a context specific cost function using empirical experiments and expert feedback. We study two RL policies: an ICU threshold rule computed via Monte Carlo grid search, and a policy based on a posterior averaged Q learning agent. We validate the framework by fitting the epidemic model to publicly available ICU occupancy data from the COVID 19 pandemic in England and then generating counterfactual roll out scenarios under each RL controller, which allows us to compare the RL policies to the historical government strategy. Over a 300 day period and for a range of cost parameters, both controllers substantially reduce ICU burden relative to the observed interventions, illustrating how Bayesian sequential learning combined with RL can support the design of epidemic control policies.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces computationally efficient Random-knots and B-spline spatial covariance estimators for sparsified data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in classical functional data analysis, which requires densely measured data, by developing techniques for sparsified mean estimation using spatial correlations.

Method: The authors propose Random-knots-Spatial and B-spline-Spatial estimators for constructing the covariance function, leveraging sparsified individual trajectories.

Result: Theoretical findings show high accuracy under regularity conditions, validated by Monte Carlo simulations and applied in clustering multi-domain data using the new estimators.

Conclusion: The proposed estimators offer an effective and computationally efficient solution for analyzing sparsified data in functional principal components analysis.

Abstract: Motivated by recent work involving the analysis of leveraging spatial correlations in sparsified mean estimation, we present a novel procedure for constructing covariance estimator. The proposed Random-knots (Random-knots-Spatial) and B-spline (Bspline-Spatial) estimators of the covariance function are computationally efficient. Asymptotic pointwise of the covariance are obtained for sparsified individual trajectories under some regularity conditions. Our proposed nonparametric method well perform the functional principal components analysis for the case of sparsified data, where the number of repeated measurements available per subject is small. In contrast, classical functional data analysis requires a large number of regularly spaced measurements per subject. Model selection techniques, such as the Akaike information criterion, are used to choose the model dimension corresponding to the number of eigenfunctions in the model. Theoretical results are illustrated with Monte Carlo simulation experiments. Finally, we cluster multi-domain data by replacing the covariance function with our proposed covariance estimator during PCA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of learning systems of ODEs from scarce, partial, and noisy state observations.

Method: Combine sparse recovery strategies for ODEs with RKHS techniques to estimate states and discretize equations.

Result: Significant improvements in accuracy, sample efficiency, and robustness to noise for both equation learning and state estimation.

Conclusion: This framework surpasses existing algorithms in capabilities and extends equation discovery's modeling flexibility.

Abstract: We develop an all-at-once modeling framework for learning systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE) from scarce, partial, and noisy observations of the states. The proposed methodology amounts to a combination of sparse recovery strategies for the ODE over a function library combined with techniques from reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory for estimating the state and discretizing the ODE. Our numerical experiments reveal that the proposed strategy leads to significant gains in terms of accuracy, sample efficiency, and robustness to noise, both in terms of learning the equation and estimating the unknown states. This work demonstrates capabilities well beyond existing and widely used algorithms while extending the modeling flexibility of other recent developments in equation discovery.

### [925] [Hierarchical biomarker thresholding: a model-agnostic framework for stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18030)
*O. Debeaupuis*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper provides a framework for reproducible patient-level decisions in biomarker pipelines by introducing hierarchical thresholding, addressing selection biases, prevalence shifts, and instability in scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biomarker pipelines often fail to generalize across sites due to dependencies, shifts in prevalence, and mismatches in scoring scales.

Method: The proposed framework uses a risk decomposition theorem that breaks down factors influencing hierarchical thresholding and integrates patient-block bootstraps for stability assessment.

Result: The framework reconciles heterogeneous decision rules, ensures reproducibility of patient-level decisions on a quantile scale, and provides diagnostics like flip-rate and operating-point shift.

Conclusion: The model-agnostic method improves decision-making robustness and defensibility in biomarker pipelines through its selection-honest thresholding approach.

Abstract: Many biomarker pipelines require patient-level decisions aggregated from instance-level (cell/patch) scores. Thresholds tuned on pooled instances often fail across sites due to hierarchical dependence, prevalence shift, and score-scale mismatch. We present a selection-honest framework for hierarchical thresholding that makes patient-level decisions reproducible and more defensible. At its core is a risk decomposition theorem for selection-honest thresholds. The theorem separates contributions from (i) internal fit and patient-level generalization, (ii) operating-point shift reflecting prevalence and shape changes, and (iii) a stability term that penalizes sensitivity to threshold perturbations. The stability component is computable via patient-block bootstraps mapped through a monotone modulus of risk. This framework is model-agnostic, reconciles heterogeneous decision rules on a quantile scale, and yields monotone-invariant ensembles and reportable diagnostics (e.g. flip-rate, operating-point shift).

*Guansu Wang,Peijie Sun*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces W3AR, a method leveraging ASR attention for fine-grained TTS alignment, enhancing quality and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTS models struggle with evaluation methods, especially at a word-level, which is crucial for natural speech synthesis.

Method: The proposed W3AR uses attention mechanisms from pre-trained ASR models for word-level reward signals, aiding TTS optimization without explicit annotations.

Result: W3AR improves TTS quality, enhances robustness for unseen speakers, and suggests a new approach for using understanding models as evaluators.

Conclusion: W3AR demonstrates improved TTS performance using ASR attention and presents a broader strategy for generative model optimization through fine-grained evaluators.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) have enabled models to clone arbitrary unseen speakers and synthesize high-quality, natural-sounding speech. However, evaluation methods lag behind: typical mean opinion score (MOS) estimators perform regression over entire utterances, while failures usually occur in a few problematic words. We observe that encoder-decoder ASR models (e.g., Whisper) surface word-level mismatches between speech and text via cross-attention, providing a fine-grained reward signal. Building on this, we introduce Word-level TTS Alignment by ASR-driven Attentive Reward (W3AR). Without explicit reward annotations, W3AR uses attention from a pre-trained ASR model to drive finer-grained alignment and optimization of sequences predicted by a TTS model. Experiments show that W3AR improves the quality of existing TTS systems and strengthens zero-shot robustness on unseen speakers. More broadly, our results suggest a simple recipe for generative modeling: understanding models can act as evaluators, delivering informative, fine-grained feedback for optimization.

TL;DR: This paper presents InstructAudio, a unified framework for instruction-based control of both speech and music generation, overcoming limitations in existing TTS and TTM models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTS and TTM systems lack effective integration and instruction-based control capabilities, with existing methods relying on expert annotations and reference audio, creating challenges for unified modeling.

Method: InstructAudio employs joint and single diffusion transformer layers, enabling a standardized instruction-phoneme input format. The model is trained on extensive data (50K hours of speech, 20K hours of music) for multi-task learning and cross-modal alignment.

Result: InstructAudio achieves optimal results on most metrics compared to mainstream TTS and TTM models, supporting expressive generation tasks in English and Chinese.

Conclusion: InstructAudio is the first framework to unify instruction-controlled speech and music generation, successfully addressing current limitations and broadening possibilities in acoustic modeling.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) and text-to-music (TTM) models face significant limitations in instruction-based control. TTS systems usually depend on reference audio for timbre, offer only limited text-level attribute control, and rarely support dialogue generation. TTM systems are constrained by input conditioning requirements that depend on expert knowledge annotations. The high heterogeneity of these input control conditions makes them difficult to joint modeling with speech synthesis. Despite sharing common acoustic modeling characteristics, these two tasks have long been developed independently, leaving open the challenge of achieving unified modeling through natural language instructions. We introduce InstructAudio, a unified framework that enables instruction-based (natural language descriptions) control of acoustic attributes including timbre (gender, age), paralinguistic (emotion, style, accent), and musical (genre, instrument, rhythm, atmosphere). It supports expressive speech, music, and dialogue generation in English and Chinese. The model employs joint and single diffusion transformer layers with a standardized instruction-phoneme input format, trained on 50K hours of speech and 20K hours of music data, enabling multi-task learning and cross-modal alignment. Fig. 1 visualizes performance comparisons with mainstream TTS and TTM models, demonstrating that InstructAudio achieves optimal results on most metrics. To our best knowledge, InstructAudio represents the first instruction-controlled framework unifying speech and music generation.

*KM Khalid Saifullah,Daniel Palmer*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Memory-less reactive multi-agent navigation leads to inefficient routes and increased travel times due to routing loops. Introducing Object Memory Management (OMM) resolves these issues effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of routing loops caused by memory-less reactive rerouting in decentralized multi-agent navigation.

Method: Systematic simulation experiments with varying vehicle densities and obstacle frequencies, testing a lightweight memory-enabled mechanism called Object Memory Management (OMM).

Result: OMM reduced average travel time by 75.7%, wait time by 88%, and the average route recalculations per vehicle compared to memory-less setups.

Conclusion: Persistent shared memory is crucial for effective multi-agent coordination, substantially improving performance in dynamic environments beyond autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Multi-agent coordination is critical for next-generation autonomous vehicle (AV) systems, yet naive implementations of communication-based rerouting can lead to catastrophic performance degradation. This study investigates a fundamental problem in decentralized multi-agent navigation: routing loops, where vehicles without persistent obstacle memory become trapped in cycles of inefficient path recalculation. Through systematic simulation experiments involving 72 unique configurations across varying vehicle densities (15, 35, 55 vehicles) and obstacle frequencies (6, 20 obstacles), we demonstrate that memory-less reactive rerouting increases average travel time by up to 682% compared to baseline conditions. To address this, we introduce Object Memory Management (OMM), a lightweight mechanism enabling agents to retain and share knowledge of previously encountered obstacles. OMM operates by maintaining a distributed blacklist of blocked nodes, which each agent consults during Dijkstra-based path recalculation, effectively preventing redundant routing attempts. Our results show that OMM-enabled coordination reduces average travel time by 75.7% and wait time by 88% compared to memory-less systems, while requiring only 1.67 route recalculations per vehicle versus 9.83 in memory-less scenarios. This work provides empirical evidence that persistent, shared memory is not merely beneficial but essential for robust multi-agent coordination in dynamic environments. The findings have implications beyond autonomous vehicles, informing the design of decentralized systems in robotics, network routing, and distributed AI. We provide a comprehensive experimental analysis, including detailed scenario breakdowns, scalability assessments, and visual documentation of the routing loop phenomenon, demonstrating OMM's critical role in preventing detrimental feedback cycles in cooperative multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: The paper presents a market-making framework to coordinate multi-agent systems composed of large language models (LLMs), improving their trustworthiness, transparency, and accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in trust, transparency, and accountability when foundation models function as multi-agent systems, overcoming the limits of traditional coordination mechanisms.

Method: Introduces an economic market-making framework for multi-agent LLM systems where agents act as market participants, trading probabilistic beliefs to achieve truthful outcomes via structured interactions without external enforcement.

Result: The framework achieved up to 10% accuracy improvements over single-shot baselines while maintaining interpretability and transparency in tasks such as factual reasoning, ethical judgment, and commonsense inference.

Conclusion: Economic coordination principles can enable scalable, self-correcting, and socially responsible multi-agent LLM systems, ensuring trust and oversight in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: As foundation models are increasingly deployed as interacting agents in multi-agent systems, their collective behavior raises new challenges for trustworthiness, transparency, and accountability. Traditional coordination mechanisms, such as centralized oversight or adversarial adjudication, struggle to scale and often obscure how decisions emerge. We introduce a market-making framework for multi-agent large language model (LLM) coordination that organizes agent interactions as structured economic exchanges. In this setup, each agent acts as a market participant, updating and trading probabilistic beliefs, to converge toward shared, truthful outcomes. By aligning local incentives with collective epistemic goals, the framework promotes self-organizing, verifiable reasoning without requiring external enforcement. Empirically, we evaluate this approach across factual reasoning, ethical judgment, and commonsense inference tasks. Market-based coordination yields accuracy gains of up to 10% over single-shot baselines while preserving interpretability and transparency of intermediate reasoning steps. Beyond these improvements, our findings demonstrate that economic coordination principles can operationalize accountability and robustness in multi-agent LLM systems, offering a scalable pathway toward self-correcting, socially responsible AI capable of maintaining trust and oversight in real world deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consensus strategies in multi-agent systems face issues like adaptability, scalability, communication bottlenecks, and delayed decision-making, affecting their performance on complex tasks.

Method: Uses a three-layer architecture: confidence-based local voting, cross-cluster communication with partial knowledge sharing, and global orchestration for final decision-making. The model reduces communication complexity from quadratic to linear.

Result: Achieved 99.9% reduction in communication overhead during consensus convergence in simulated environments and ensured adaptability across complex tasks.

Conclusion: The HACN model effectively addresses critical multi-agent consensus challenges by enabling scalable, adaptable, and efficient consensus strategies, with reduced communication overhead.

Abstract: The consensus strategies used in collaborative multi-agent systems (MAS) face notable challenges related to adaptability, scalability, and convergence certainties. These approaches, including structured workflows, debate models, and iterative voting, often lead to communication bottlenecks, stringent decision-making processes, and delayed responses in solving complex and evolving tasks. This article introduces a three-tier architecture, the Hierarchical Adaptive Consensus Network (\hacn), which suggests various consensus policies based on task characterization and agent performance metrics. The first layer collects the confidence-based voting outcomes of several local agent clusters. In contrast, the second level facilitates inter-cluster communication through cross-clustered partial knowledge sharing and dynamic timeouts. The third layer provides system-wide coordination and final arbitration by employing a global orchestration framework with adaptable decision rules. The proposed model achieves $\bigO(n)$ communication complexity, as opposed to the $\bigO(n^2)$ complexity of the existing fully connected MAS. Experiments performed in a simulated environment yielded a 99.9\% reduction in communication overhead during consensus convergence. Furthermore, the proposed approach ensures consensus convergence through hierarchical escalation and dynamic adaptation for a wide variety of complicated tasks.

Motivation: The paper aims to address intelligent decision-making challenges in smart manufacturing by integrating innovative agentic AI driven by LLMs with traditional MAS architectures.

Method: A layered architecture combining perception, analytics, and optimization managed by an LLM Planner Agent, complemented by rule-based edge agents and an interactive HITL interface.

Result: The framework demonstrated schema detection, adaptive preprocessing, model optimization, and actionable maintenance recommendations validated on industrial datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid design improves robustness, scalability, and explainability for RxM in smart manufacturing, effectively merging higher reasoning with autonomous execution capabilities.

Abstract: The convergence of Agentic AI and MAS enables a new paradigm for intelligent decision making in SMS. Traditional MAS architectures emphasize distributed coordination and specialized autonomy, while recent advances in agentic AI driven by LLMs introduce higher order reasoning, planning, and tool orchestration capabilities. This paper presents a hybrid agentic AI and multi agent framework for a Prescriptive Maintenance use case, where LLM based agents provide strategic orchestration and adaptive reasoning, complemented by rule based and SLMs agents performing efficient, domain specific tasks on the edge. The proposed framework adopts a layered architecture that consists of perception, preprocessing, analytics, and optimization layers, coordinated through an LLM Planner Agent that manages workflow decisions and context retention. Specialized agents autonomously handle schema discovery, intelligent feature analysis, model selection, and prescriptive optimization, while a HITL interface ensures transparency and auditability of generated maintenance recommendations. This hybrid design supports dynamic model adaptation, cost efficient maintenance scheduling, and interpretable decision making. An initial proof of concept implementation is validated on two industrial manufacturing datasets. The developed framework is modular and extensible, supporting seamless integration of new agents or domain modules as capabilities evolve. The results demonstrate the system capability to automatically detect schema, adapt preprocessing pipelines, optimize model performance through adaptive intelligence, and generate actionable, prioritized maintenance recommendations. The framework shows promise in achieving improved robustness, scalability, and explainability for RxM in smart manufacturing, bridging the gap between high level agentic reasoning and low level autonomous execution.

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-agent AI framework to automate teaching slide adaptation, validated through real-world testing with promising results in accuracy, coherence, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Educators often face challenges in adapting teaching slides to their unique pedagogical needs and student contexts, a process that is both essential and time-intensive.

Method: The research involved educator interviews to identify adaptation challenges and then proposed a multi-agent framework capable of automating slide modifications based on instructor specifications. This system was evaluated using real-world data and requests.

Result: The framework consistently scored high on intent alignment, factual accuracy, and content coherence while maintaining visual clarity. It also demonstrated timely operations and a strong operational agreement with human experts, achieving an F1 score of 0.89.

Conclusion: The proposed AI framework can efficiently manage the logistical aspects of slide adaptation, empowering educators to prioritize creative and strategic teaching efforts.

Abstract: The adaptation of teaching slides to instructors' situated teaching needs, including pedagogical styles and their students' context, is a critical yet time-consuming task for educators. Through a series of educator interviews, we first identify and systematically categorize the key friction points that impede this adaptation process. Grounded in these findings, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework designed to automate slide adaptation based on high-level instructor specifications. An evaluation involving 16 modification requests across 8 real-world courses validates our approach.

*Zi Wang,Xingqiao Wang,Sangah Lee,Xiaowei Xu*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: ARISE is a system designed for automated generation and refinement of academic survey papers using specialized agents and iterative rubric-guided feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in creating high-quality academic surveys due to rapid literature expansion and limitations of existing automated systems in quality control and adaptability.

Method: ARISE utilizes a modular large language model architecture with agents assigned different scholarly roles, combined with a rubric-guided iterative feedback loop for refinement.

Result: Experimental tests show ARISE outperforms existing systems and human-written surveys, achieving a high average quality score of 92.48.

Conclusion: ARISE demonstrates its ability to produce superior academic survey papers compared to current automated systems, ensuring comprehensiveness, accuracy, and scholarly rigor.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scholarly literature presents significant challenges in synthesizing comprehensive, high-quality academic surveys. Recent advancements in agentic systems offer considerable promise for automating tasks that traditionally require human expertise, including literature review, synthesis, and iterative refinement. However, existing automated survey-generation solutions often suffer from inadequate quality control, poor formatting, and limited adaptability to iterative feedback, which are core elements intrinsic to scholarly writing.
  To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE, an Agentic Rubric-guided Iterative Survey Engine designed for automated generation and continuous refinement of academic survey papers. ARISE employs a modular architecture composed of specialized large language model agents, each mirroring distinct scholarly roles such as topic expansion, citation curation, literature summarization, manuscript drafting, and peer-review-based evaluation. Central to ARISE is a rubric-guided iterative refinement loop in which multiple reviewer agents independently assess manuscript drafts using a structured, behaviorally anchored rubric, systematically enhancing the content through synthesized feedback.
  Evaluating ARISE against state-of-the-art automated systems and recent human-written surveys, our experimental results demonstrate superior performance, achieving an average rubric-aligned quality score of 92.48. ARISE consistently surpasses baseline methods across metrics of comprehensiveness, accuracy, formatting, and overall scholarly rigor.

### [937] [Efficient Dynamic and Momentum Aperture Optimization for Lattice Design Using Multipoint Bayesian Algorithm Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17850)
*Z. Zhang,I. Agapov,S. Gasiorowski,T. Hellert,W. Neiswanger,X. Huang,D. Ratner*

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces multipoint Bayesian algorithm execution (multipointBAX) to drastically improve computational efficiency in storage ring design optimization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the computational inefficiencies of storage ring design optimization, which traditionally involves extensive particle-tracking simulations, limiting search scope and final design quality.

Method: The authors utilized multipointBAX, which integrates Bayesian algorithm execution with single particle modeling, along with neural networks to enhance multipoint, multiobjective tasks such as dynamic aperture and momentum optimization.

Result: MultipointBAX achieved equivalent Pareto front results using over two orders of magnitude fewer computations compared to conventional genetic algorithms, demonstrating significant computational cost reductions.

Conclusion: MultipointBAX establishes itself as a cost-efficient and effective alternative to black-box optimization methods, showing promising applications in designing advanced light sources, colliders, and large-scale scientific facilities.

Abstract: We demonstrate that multipoint Bayesian algorithm execution can overcome fundamental computational challenges in storage ring design optimization. Dynamic (DA) and momentum (MA) optimization is a multipoint, multiobjective design task for storage rings, ultimately informing the flux of x-ray sources and luminosity of colliders. Current state-of-art black-box optimization methods require extensive particle-tracking simulations for each trial configuration; the high computational cost restricts the extent of the search to $\sim 10^3$ configurations, and therefore limits the quality of the final design. We remove this bottleneck using multipointBAX, which selects, simulates, and models each trial configuration at the single particle level. We demonstrate our approach on a novel design for a fourth-generation light source, with neural-network powered multipointBAX achieving equivalent Pareto front results using more than two orders of magnitude fewer tracking computations compared to genetic algorithms. The significant reduction in cost positions multipointBAX as a promising alternative to black-box optimization, and we anticipate multipointBAX will be instrumental in the design of future light sources, colliders, and large-scale scientific facilities.

Conclusion: MOCLIP is proposed as a scalable, versatile platform enhancing next-generation photonic design and data-driven applications in nanophotonics.

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) are transforming artificial intelligence by enabling generalizable, data-efficient solutions across different domains for a broad range of applications. However, the lack of large and diverse datasets limits the development of FM in nanophotonics. This work presents MOCLIP (Metasurface Optics Contrastive Learning Pretrained), a nanophotonic foundation model that integrates metasurface geometry and spectra within a shared latent space. MOCLIP employs contrastive learning to align geometry and spectral representations using an experimentally acquired dataset with a sample density comparable to ImageNet-1K.

It also shows generative latent-space optimization reaching 97 percent accuracy. Finally, we introduce an optical information storage concept that uses MOCLIP to achieve a density of 0.1 Gbit per square millimeter at the resolution limit, exceeding commercial optical media by a factor of six. These results position MOCLIP as a scalable and versatile platform for next-generation photonic design and data-driven applications.

TL;DR: The study evaluates checkpoint installation protocols and integrity validation in AI training on macOS/APFS, demonstrating effective corruption detection and quantifying reliability-performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of corrupted files caused by unsafe checkpoint installation during deep learning training due to failures.

Method: The authors studied three checkpoint write modes (unsafe, atomic_nodirsync, and atomic_dirsync) and implemented a format-agnostic integrity guard using SHA-256 checksums with rollback mechanisms. They conducted controlled experiments, testing for crash and corruption resilience.

Result: The integrity guard achieved a corruption detection rate of 99.8%-100% without false positives. However, performance overheads ranged from 56.5%-108.4% to 84.2%-570.6% for more durable write modes compared to the unsafe baseline.

Conclusion: The research highlights trade-offs between reliability and performance, offering valuable guidance for deploying robust AI training infrastructure on macOS/APFS.

Abstract: Deep learning training relies on periodic checkpoints to recover from failures, but unsafe checkpoint installation can leave corrupted files on disk. This paper presents an experimental study of checkpoint installation protocols and integrity validation for AI training on macOS/APFS. We implement three write modes with increasing durability guarantees: unsafe (baseline, no fsync), atomic_nodirsync (file-level durability via fsync()), and atomic_dirsync (file + directory durability). We design a format-agnostic integrity guard using SHA-256 checksums with automatic rollback. Through controlled experiments including crash injection (430 unsafe-mode trials) and corruption injection (1,600 atomic-mode trials), we demonstrate that the integrity guard detects 99.8-100% of corruptions with zero false positives. Performance overhead is 56.5-108.4% for atomic_nodirsync and 84.2-570.6% for atomic_dirsync relative to the unsafe baseline. Our findings quantify the reliability-performance trade-offs and provide deployment guidance for production AI infrastructure.

### [940] [What Drives Cross-lingual Ranking? Retrieval Approaches with Multilingual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19324)
*Roksana Goworek,Olivia Macmillan-Scott,Eda B. Özyiğit*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates approaches for Cross-lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) and proposes models prioritizing semantic multilingual embeddings and targeted learning, showing significant gains for low-resource and cross-script language pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges in CLIR caused by disparities in language script, resources, and weak cross-lingual semantic alignment.

Method: The paper systematically evaluates four methods: document translation, multilingual dense retrieval with pretrained encoders, contrastive learning at various levels, and cross-encoder re-ranking across benchmark datasets.

Result: Dense retrieval models generally outperform lexical methods. Contrastive learning improves semantic alignment, while re-ranking depends on high-quality training data. Gains are particularly notable for low-resource and cross-script languages.

Conclusion: Translation-based pipelines are less effective; systems should emphasize semantic multilingual embeddings and learning-based alignment, especially for under-resourced and cross-script scenarios.

Abstract: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) enables access to multilingual knowledge but remains challenging due to disparities in resources, scripts, and weak cross-lingual semantic alignment in embedding models. Existing pipelines often rely on translation and monolingual retrieval heuristics, which add computational overhead and noise, degrading performance. This work systematically evaluates four intervention types, namely document translation, multilingual dense retrieval with pretrained encoders, contrastive learning at word, phrase, and query-document levels, and cross-encoder re-ranking, across three benchmark datasets. We find that dense retrieval models trained specifically for CLIR consistently outperform lexical matching methods and derive little benefit from document translation. Contrastive learning mitigates language biases and yields substantial improvements for encoders with weak initial alignment, and re-ranking can be effective, but depends on the quality of the cross-encoder training data. Although high-resource languages still dominate overall performance, gains over lexical and document-translated baselines are most pronounced for low-resource and cross-script pairs. These findings indicate that cross-lingual search systems should prioritise semantic multilingual embeddings and targeted learning-based alignment over translation-based pipelines, particularly for cross-script and under-resourced languages.

*Olivia Macmillan-Scott,Roksana Goworek,Eda B. Özyiğit*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The study investigates multilingual language models' effectiveness in cross-lingual query expansion, introducing pseudo-documents to improve retrieval through generative techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cross-lingual information retrieval by analyzing generative query expansion techniques using multilingual large language models.

Method: Evaluating recent mLLMs and fine-tuned models across multiple generative query expansion strategies, analyzing their impact on retrieval performance.

Result: Query length determines prompt effectiveness, fine-tuning improves performance only with similar data formats, and substantial disparities exist based on language scripts.

Conclusion: Balanced multilingual training and evaluation resources are crucial to improving cross-lingual retrieval and bridging linguistic disparities.

Abstract: Query expansion is the reformulation of a user query by adding semantically related information, and is an essential component of monolingual and cross-lingual information retrieval used to ensure that relevant documents are not missed. Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation. Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval. This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts. Fine-tuning is found to lead to performance gains only when the training and test data are of similar format. These outcomes underline the need for more balanced multilingual and cross-lingual training and evaluation resources.

*Weijie Jiang,Armando Ordorica,Jaewon Yang,Olafur Gudmundsson,Yucheng Tu,Huizhong Duan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to model and enhance user revisitation on Pinterest by reducing causal noise and optimizing recommendations, yielding increased user retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve user retention and loyalty on Pinterest by optimizing revisitation of content, a crucial factor for platform growth.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework involving surrogate attribution to link user saves to revisitation, scalable event aggregation, and optimized recommendations.

Result: The framework was deployed on Pinterest and led to a 0.1% increase in active users without extra computational costs.

Conclusion: The work effectively enhances long-term user retention by addressing challenges in modeling revisitation behavior and improving recommendation accuracy in a scalable and interpretable manner.

Abstract: User retention is a critical objective for online platforms like Pinterest, as it strengthens user loyalty and drives growth through repeated engagement. A key indicator of retention is revisitation, i.e., when users return to view previously saved content, a behavior often sparked by personalized recommendations and user satisfaction. However, modeling and optimizing revisitation poses significant challenges. One core difficulty is accurate attribution: it is often unclear which specific user actions or content exposures trigger a revisit, since many confounding factors (e.g., content quality, user interface, notifications, or even changing user intent) can influence return behavior. Additionally, the scale and timing of revisitations introduce further complexity; users may revisit content days or even weeks after their initial interaction, requiring the system to maintain and associate extensive historical records across millions of users and sessions. These complexities render existing methods insufficient for robustly capturing and optimizing long-term revisitation. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel, lightweight, and interpretable framework for modeling revisitation behavior and optimizing long-term user retention in Pinterest's search-based recommendation context. By defining a surrogate attribution process that links saves to subsequent revisitations, we reduce noise in the causal relationship between user actions and return visits. Our scalable event aggregation pipeline enables large-scale analysis of user revisitation patterns and enhances the ranking system's ability to surface items with high retention value. Deployed on Pinterest's Related Pins surface to serve 500+ million users, the framework led to a significant lift of 0.1% in active users without additional computational costs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for extracting interpretable, monosemantic neurons from recommender system embeddings using Sparse Autoencoders (SAE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the interpretability and control of user and item embeddings in recommender systems, while maintaining prediction accuracy.

Method: A Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) combined with a prediction-aware objective aligns monosemantic neurons with user-item affinity predictions of the recommender.

Result: The approach identifies neurons corresponding to properties like genre and popularity, enabling targeted control without altering the base recommender.

Conclusion: The proposed method is generalizable across models and extends personalization by offering interpretable and actionable embeddings for recommendation systems.

Abstract: We present a method for extracting \emph{monosemantic} neurons, defined as latent dimensions that align with coherent and interpretable concepts, from user and item embeddings in recommender systems. Our approach employs a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to reveal semantic structure within pretrained representations. In contrast to work on language models, monosemanticity in recommendation must preserve the interactions between separate user and item embeddings. To achieve this, we introduce a \emph{prediction aware} training objective that backpropagates through a frozen recommender and aligns the learned latent structure with the model's user-item affinity predictions. The resulting neurons capture properties such as genre, popularity, and temporal trends, and support post hoc control operations including targeted filtering and content promotion without modifying the base model. Our method generalizes across different recommendation models and datasets, providing a practical tool for interpretable and controllable personalization.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPINRec, a novel model-agnostic method to improve explanation fidelity in recommender systems by adapting path-integration techniques with stochastic baseline sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explanation fidelity is insufficiently investigated in recommender systems, despite its importance in ensuring model explanations align with true reasoning.

Method: SPINRec uses stochastic baseline sampling to integrate user profiles from empirical data distributions, enhancing stability and personalization in model explanations.

Result: SPINRec was comprehensively tested across three models, three datasets, and various counterfactual metrics, showing superior performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: SPINRec sets a new standard for explanation fidelity in recommendation systems, with publicly available tools for further exploration.

Abstract: Explanation fidelity, which measures how accurately an explanation reflects a model's true reasoning, remains critically underexplored in recommender systems. We introduce SPINRec (Stochastic Path Integration for Neural Recommender Explanations), a model-agnostic approach that adapts path-integration techniques to the sparse and implicit nature of recommendation data. To overcome the limitations of prior methods, SPINRec employs stochastic baseline sampling: instead of integrating from a fixed or unrealistic baseline, it samples multiple plausible user profiles from the empirical data distribution and selects the most faithful attribution path. This design captures the influence of both observed and unobserved interactions, yielding more stable and personalized explanations. We conduct the most comprehensive fidelity evaluation to date across three models (MF, VAE, NCF), three datasets (ML1M, Yahoo! Music, Pinterest), and a suite of counterfactual metrics, including AUC-based perturbation curves and fixed-length diagnostics. SPINRec consistently outperforms all baselines, establishing a new benchmark for faithful explainability in recommendation. Code and evaluation tools are publicly available at https://github.com/DeltaLabTLV/SPINRec.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) for cold-start item recommendations on Netflix, outperforming existing methods by up to 8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of traditional collaborative filtering in cold-start recommendations, leveraging LLMs' reasoning abilities for sparse interaction scenarios.

Method: Proposed novel reasoning approaches for LLMs by employing supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid strategies for cold-start recommendation problems.

Result: Outperformed Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in cold-start recommendations, showing significant improvements in performance on real-world data.

Conclusion: LLMs with targeted reasoning strategies are highly effective in addressing cold-start item recommendation challenges, demonstrating substantial practical and methodological advancements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents COREC, a framework for enhancing user control in recommendation systems by enabling fine-grained manipulation of ranked results using explicit attribute-based commands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current re-rankers in recommendation systems, which lack the ability to incorporate fine-grained user control and balance user preferences with multiple attribute constraints.

Method: The authors propose COREC, a token-augmented re-ranking framework that permits users to guide rankings through explicit attribute-based signals while balancing these signals with latent preferences.

Result: COREC outperforms existing baselines in recommendation effectiveness and provides better adherence to user-specified attribute requirements.

Conclusion: COREC enhances the user experience in recommendation systems by enabling more precise, flexible, and predictable user control over ranked recommendations while maintaining personalization.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as re-rankers is shifting recommender systems towards a user-centric paradigm. However, a significant gap remains: current re-rankers often lack mechanisms for fine-grained user control. They struggle to balance inherent user preferences with multiple attribute-based constraints, often resorting to simplistic hard filtering that can excessively narrow the recommendation pool and yield suboptimal results. This limitation leaves users as passive recipients rather than active collaborators in the recommendation process. To bridge this gap, we propose COREC, a novel token-augmented re-ranking framework that incorporates specific user requirements in co-creating the recommendation outcome. COREC empowers users to steer re-ranking results with precise and flexible control via explicit, attribute-based signals. The framework learns to balance these commands against latent preferences, yielding rankings that adhere to user instructions without sacrificing personalization. Experiments show that COREC: (1) exceeds state-of-the-art baselines on standard recommendation effectiveness and (2) demonstrates superior adherence to specific attribute requirements, proving that COREC enables fine-grained and predictable manipulation of the rankings.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ProHD is an approximation algorithm for efficient and accurate computation of Hausdorff Distance (HD) on large datasets by using projection-guided extreme points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing exact Hausdorff Distance (HD) for large, high-dimensional datasets is computationally prohibitive, necessitating faster approaches for practical applications.

Method: ProHD selects a subset of candidate points by projecting data onto informative directions (centroid axis and top principal components), computing HD with bounded error.

Result: ProHD achieves 10–100× speed improvement over exact algorithms and 5–20× lower error compared to random sampling methods, tested on various datasets with up to two million points.

Conclusion: ProHD provides a scalable and accurate solution enabling HD computations in time-critical scenarios, such as large vector databases and streaming data.

Abstract: The Hausdorff distance (HD) is a robust measure of set dissimilarity, but computing it exactly on large, high-dimensional datasets is prohibitively expensive. We propose \textbf{ProHD}, a projection-guided approximation algorithm that dramatically accelerates HD computation while maintaining high accuracy. ProHD identifies a small subset of candidate "extreme" points by projecting the data onto a few informative directions (such as the centroid axis and top principal components) and computing the HD on this subset. This approach guarantees an underestimate of the true HD with a bounded additive error and typically achieves results within a few percent of the exact value. In extensive experiments on image, physics, and synthetic datasets (up to two million points in $D=256$), ProHD runs 10--100$\times$ faster than exact algorithms while attaining 5--20$\times$ lower error than random sampling-based approximations. Our method enables practical HD calculations in scenarios like large vector databases and streaming data, where quick and reliable set distance estimation is needed.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The study explores active recommendation for predicting interaction times and delivering items, proposing the PASRec model for improved alignment and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most recommendation systems are passive and miss opportunities for interaction once users exit the application. The study aims to address this gap by enabling proactive recommendations.

Method: PASRec, a diffusion-based framework, jointly optimizes estimation of Time of Interest (ToI) and generation of Item of Interest (IoI) based on the predicted ToI.

Result: PASRec outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines across five benchmark datasets under two evaluation settings (leave-one-out and temporal splits).

Conclusion: Aligning predictions for ToI and IoI via PASRec enhances the effectiveness of active recommendation systems for sequential interaction modeling.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models user preferences to predict the next target item. Most existing work is passive, where the system responds only when users open the application, missing chances after closure. We investigate active recommendation, which predicts the next interaction time and actively delivers items. Two challenges: accurately estimating the Time of Interest (ToI) and generating Item of Interest (IoI) conditioned on the predicted ToI. We propose PASRec, a diffusion-based framework that aligns ToI and IoI via a joint objective. Experiments on five benchmarks show superiority over eight state-of-the-art baselines under leave-one-out and temporal splits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a systematic way to analyze and categorize bioart, addressing its hybrid nature across multiple dimensions like art, science, technology, ethics, and politics.

Method: The study mapped 81 bioartworks on 13 dimensions using a codebook-based representation and applied clustering algorithms with 4D UMAP embeddings to optimize pattern identification.

Result: The optimal method was Agglomerative clustering (k=15) achieving notable performance metrics (silhouette score: 0.664). Key insights included four patterns in bioart related to methodology, technique, evolution, and conceptual affinities.

Conclusion: Bioartlas effectively organizes and categorizes bioart to reveal underlying structures and concepts, with results made publicly accessible via a web interface and open dataset.

Abstract: Bioart's hybrid nature spanning art, science, technology, ethics, and politics defies traditional single-axis categorization. I present BioArtlas, analyzing 81 bioart works across thirteen curated dimensions using novel axis-aware representations that preserve semantic distinctions while enabling cross-dimensional comparison. Our codebook-based approach groups related concepts into unified clusters, addressing polysemy in cultural terminology. Comprehensive evaluation of up to 800 representation-space-algorithm combinations identifies Agglomerative clustering at k=15 on 4D UMAP as optimal (silhouette 0.664 +/- 0.008, trustworthiness/continuity 0.805/0.812). The approach reveals four organizational patterns: artist-specific methodological cohesion, technique-based segmentation, temporal artistic evolution, and trans-temporal conceptual affinities. By separating analytical optimization from public communication, I provide rigorous analysis and accessible exploration through an interactive web interface (https://www.bioartlas.com) with the dataset publicly available (https://github.com/joonhyungbae/BioArtlas).

*Wei Yang,Yiran Zhu,Zilin Li,Xunjia Zhang,Hongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with hierarchical understanding tasks. A proposed Self-Elicited Knowledge Distillation (SEKD) method improves their performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often fail to maintain consistency in hierarchical tasks, suggesting a need for enhanced stepwise reasoning mechanisms.

Method: The same VLM is conditioned to reason step by step, acting as a teacher for a single-pass student that distills hard labels, soft distributions, and decoder hidden states without requiring human labels or external tools.

Result: SEKD achieves up to +29.50 percentage points improvement in in-domain path consistency and significantly boosts zero-shot performance on unseen taxonomies from 4.15% to 42.26%. Gains are also seen on mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: SEKD enables compact VLMs to handle dependency-aware multi-step reasoning across diverse taxonomies without requiring additional annotation, offering scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) possess rich knowledge but often fail on hierarchical understanding tasks, where the goal is to predict a coarse-to-fine taxonomy path that remains consistent across all levels. We compare three inference paradigms for hierarchical VQA and find that stepwise reasoning, when conditioned on prior answers, significantly outperforms single-pass prompting. Further analysis indicates that the main limitation of current VLMs is their inability to maintain cross-level state, rather than a lack of taxonomic knowledge. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose Self-Elicited Knowledge Distillation (SEKD), which requires no human labels or external tools: the same VLM is prompted to reason step by step and act as a teacher by exposing its hard labels, soft distributions, and decoder hidden states, while a single-pass student distills these signals. The student VLM remains efficient while approaching the accuracy of its multi-step teacher. It improves in-domain path consistency (HCA) by up to +29.50 percentage points, raises zero-shot HCA on an unseen taxonomy from 4.15% to 42.26%, and yields gains on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Because all supervision is self-elicited, SEKD scales to new taxonomies and datasets without annotation cost, providing a practical route to imbue compact VLMs with dependency-aware multi-step reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential security concerns arising from audio-visual deepfakes and the lack of generalizable, effective solutions for multi-modal deepfake detection.

Method: The method incorporates audio-visual correlation approximated as a Gaussian latent variable within a variational Bayesian framework. It employs difference convolutions, high-pass filters for forgery trace detection, and factorization of latent variables into modality-specific and correlation-specific features with orthogonality constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm that FoVB significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: FoVB demonstrates superior capability as an effective, generalizable method for deepfake detection by leveraging advanced variational Bayesian techniques to capture cross-modal inconsistencies.

Abstract: The widespread application of AIGC contents has brought not only unprecedented opportunities, but also potential security concerns, e.g., audio-visual deepfakes. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop an effective and generalizable method for multi-modal deepfake detection. Typically, the audio-visual correlation learning could expose subtle cross-modal inconsistencies, e.g., audio-visual misalignment, which serve as crucial clues in deepfake detection. In this paper, we reformulate the correlation learning with variational Bayesian estimation, where audio-visual correlation is approximated as a Gaussian distributed latent variable, and thus develop a novel framework for deepfake detection, i.e., Forgery-aware Audio-Visual Adaptation with Variational Bayes (FoVB). Specifically, given the prior knowledge of pre-trained backbones, we adopt two core designs to estimate audio-visual correlations effectively. First, we exploit various difference convolutions and a high-pass filter to discern local and global forgery traces from both modalities. Second, with the extracted forgery-aware features, we estimate the latent Gaussian variable of audio-visual correlation via variational Bayes. Then, we factorize the variable into modality-specific and correlation-specific ones with orthogonality constraint, allowing them to better learn intra-modal and cross-modal forgery traces with less entanglement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FoVB outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in various benchmarks.

### [952] [Analog Physical Systems Can Exhibit Double Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17825)
*Sam Dillavou,Jason W Rocks,Jacob F Wycoff,Andrea J Liu,Douglas J Durian*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper explores double descent in analog resistive networks, showing they can achieve over-parameterization benefits similar to digital AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether analog physical systems can demonstrate double descent behavior similar to digital AI, and to explore their potential advantages in energy efficiency and speed.

Method: The study uses a decentralized analog network of resistive elements that trains without digital processors and tests the impact of standard and modified training protocols for handling component imperfections.

Result: The study finds that standard training protocols fail to achieve double descent due to component imperfections, but modified protocols tailored to these imperfections succeed in demonstrating this behavior.

Conclusion: Analog physical systems, if trained appropriately with customized protocols, can replicate key behaviors of digital AI, such as double descent, suggesting potential applications and parallels in biological systems.

Abstract: An important component of the success of large AI models is double descent, in which networks avoid overfitting as they grow relative to the amount of training data, instead improving their performance on unseen data. Here we demonstrate double descent in a decentralized analog network of self-adjusting resistive elements. This system trains itself and performs tasks without a digital processor, offering potential gains in energy efficiency and speed -- but must endure component non-idealities. We find that standard training fails to yield double descent, but a modified protocol that accommodates this inherent imperfection succeeds. Our findings show that analog physical systems, if appropriately trained, can exhibit behaviors underlying the success of digital AI. Further, they suggest that biological systems might similarly benefit from over-parameterization.

### [953] [A multi-view contrastive learning framework for spatial embeddings in risk modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17954)
*Freek Holvoet,Christopher Blier-Wong,Katrien Antonio*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a contrastive learning-based framework to generate efficient spatial embeddings, improving the use of spatial data for predictive tasks in insurance and real estate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial data often remain underutilized in predictive models due to their unstructured and high-dimensional nature, while precise spatial representations are essential for risk management and underwriting in domains like insurance.

Method: The study introduces a multi-view contrastive learning framework, aligning spatial views from satellite images, OpenStreetMap features, and latitude-longitude pairs to generate low-dimensional spatial embeddings.

Result: The framework improves predictive models by enriching them with spatial embeddings, increasing accuracy in real estate price predictions and demonstrating transferability across different regions.

Conclusion: Using spatial embeddings provides interpretable and transferable enhancements to predictive accuracy, addressing limitations in conventional spatial feature utilization and enabling practical model enrichment for various datasets.

Abstract: Incorporating spatial information, particularly those influenced by climate, weather, and demographic factors, is crucial for improving underwriting precision and enhancing risk management in insurance. However, spatial data are often unstructured, high-dimensional, and difficult to integrate into predictive models. Embedding methods are needed to convert spatial data into meaningful representations for modelling tasks. We propose a novel multi-view contrastive learning framework for generating spatial embeddings that combine information from multiple spatial data sources. To train the model, we construct a spatial dataset that merges satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap features across Europe. The framework aligns these spatial views with coordinate-based encodings, producing low-dimensional embeddings that capture both spatial structure and contextual similarity. Once trained, the model generates embeddings directly from latitude-longitude pairs, enabling any dataset with coordinates to be enriched with meaningful spatial features without requiring access to the original spatial inputs. In a case study on French real estate prices, we compare models trained on raw coordinates against those using our spatial embeddings as inputs. The embeddings consistently improve predictive accuracy across generalised linear, additive, and boosting models, while providing interpretable spatial effects and demonstrating transferability to unseen regions.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: Artificial intelligence (AI) is underutilized by workers when they are aware that reliance on AI is visible to evaluators, leading to reduced task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify how workers' concerns about being perceived by evaluators influence their adoption of AI-assisted recommendations during collaborative tasks.

Method: 450 U.S.-based remote workers were hired to complete AI-assisted image categorization tasks on a labor platform. Their reliance on AI was assessed under visibility conditions, with incentives tied to feedback from evaluators.

Result: Workers showed lower adoption rates for AI tools when their reliance was visible to evaluators, subsequently decreasing task performance, despite assurances concerning evaluator objectivity.

Conclusion: Concerns about perceptions of confidence deter workers from fully utilizing AI assistance in collaborative workflows, even when reassurances are offered.

Abstract: Concerns about how workers are perceived can deter effective collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI). In a field experiment on a large online labor market, I hired 450 U.S.-based remote workers to complete an image-categorization job assisted by AI recommendations. Workers were incentivized by the prospect of a contract extension based on an HR evaluator's feedback. I find that workers adopt AI recommendations at lower rates when their reliance on AI is visible to the evaluator, resulting in a measurable decline in task performance. The effects are present despite a conservative design in which workers know that the evaluator is explicitly instructed to assess expected accuracy on the same AI-assisted task. This reduction in AI reliance persists even when the evaluator is reassured about workers' strong performance history on the platform, underscoring how difficult these concerns are to alleviate. Leveraging the platform's public feedback feature, I introduce a novel incentive-compatible elicitation method showing that workers fear heavy reliance on AI signals a lack of confidence in their own judgment, a trait they view as essential when collaborating with AI.

### [955] [Physics-informed Neural Operator Learning for Nonlinear Grad-Shafranov Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19114)
*Siqi Ding,Zitong Zhang,Guoyang Shi,Xingyu Li,Xiang Gu,Yanan Xu,Huasheng Xie,Hanyue Zhao,Yuejiang Shi,Tianyuan Liu*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The study introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) to efficiently solve the Grad-Shafranov equation for nuclear fusion applications, achieving high accuracy and physical consistency through semi-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical solvers for nuclear fusion problems are too slow, while data-driven solutions lack accuracy and physical consistency. A robust solution for real-time plasma control is needed.

Method: The paper develops PINO with physics-based loss terms, compares five neural architectures, and optimizes using semi-supervised learning, combining sparse labeled data with physics constraints.

Result: The Transformer-KAN Neural Operator (TKNO) achieves the highest supervised accuracy. Semi-supervised PINO balances interpolation (0.48% error) and extrapolation performance (4.76% error), with millisecond-level inference speed.

Conclusion: PINO demonstrates strong potential for real-time applications in fusion systems by combining speed, accuracy, and physical consistency with semi-supervised training.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence emerges as a transformative enabler for fusion energy commercialization, fast and accurate solvers become increasingly critical. In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.

### [956] [Divergence-Minimization for Latent-Structure Models: Monotone Operators, Contraction Guarantees, and Robust Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17974)
*Lei Li,Anand N. Vidyashankar*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper presents a divergence-minimization (DM) framework for robust inference in latent-mixture models, recovering and extending EM methods using various divergences. It ensures robust properties like bounded influence and validity in mixture component selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance robustness and efficiency in latent-mixture models where current methods like EM may lack stability or exhibit non-robust behavior under contamination.

Method: The DM framework optimizes a residual-adjusted divergence, generalizing EM and introducing robustness through alternative divergence choices with built-in monotonicity and consistency properties.

Result: The framework shows robust behavior with bounded influence functions, consistency, $
sqrt{n}$-asymptotic normality, and stable performance in tasks like mixture and image segmentation using divergences like Hellinger or negative exponential.

Conclusion: The DM framework serves as a practical and robust drop-in alternative to EM for latent-structure inference, addressing challenges like component order selection and contamination stability.

Abstract: We develop a divergence-minimization (DM) framework for robust and efficient inference in latent-mixture models. By optimizing a residual-adjusted divergence, the DM approach recovers EM as a special case and yields robust alternatives through different divergence choices. We establish that the sample objective decreases monotonically along the iterates, leading the DM sequence to stationary points under standard conditions, and that at the population level the operator exhibits local contractivity near the minimizer. Additionally, we verify consistency and $\sqrt{n}$-asymptotic normality of minimum-divergence estimators and of finitely many DM iterations, showing that under correct specification their limiting covariance matches the Fisher information. Robustness is analyzed via the residual-adjustment function, yielding bounded influence functions and a strictly positive breakdown bound for bounded-RAF divergences, and we contrast this with the non-robust behaviour of KL/EM. Next, we address the challenge of determining the number of mixture components by proposing a penalized divergence criterion combined with repeated sample splitting, which delivers consistent order selection and valid post-selection inference. Empirically, DM instantiations based on Hellinger and negative exponential divergences deliver accurate inference and remain stable under contamination in mixture and image-segmentation tasks. The results clarify connections to MM and proximal-point methods and offer practical defaults, making DM a drop-in alternative to EM for robust latent-structure inference.

### [957] [Matching correlated VAR time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18553)
*Ernesto Araya,Hemant Tyagi*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper studies how to match correlated VAR time series by recovering unknown permutations using probabilistic modeling, optimization techniques, and performance comparison between approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of recovering hidden permutations in multivariate time series data that are perturbed and permuted versions of each other, which extends matching independent point clouds to time series.

Method: This paper proposes to model the problem probabilistically, introduces MLE to optimize a quadratic problem over permutations, analyzes linear assignment recovery guarantees, and explores MLE convex relaxations involving alternating minimization for efficient estimation.

Result: Empirical findings show that linear assignment often performs as well or better than MLE relaxation methods and threshold results for recovery are established.

Conclusion: Efficient recovery of hidden permutations in correlated time series can be achieved using the proposed methods, particularly linear assignment showing competitive results.

Abstract: We study the problem of matching correlated VAR time series databases, where a multivariate time series is observed along with a perturbed and permuted version, and the goal is to recover the unknown matching between them. To model this, we introduce a probabilistic framework in which two time series $(x_t)_{t\in[T]},(x^\#_t)_{t\in[T]}$ are jointly generated, such that $x^\#_t=x_{π^*(t)}+σ\tilde{x}_{π^*(t)}$, where $(x_t)_{t\in[T]},(\tilde{x}_t)_{t\in[T]}$ are independent and identically distributed vector autoregressive (VAR) time series of order $1$ with Gaussian increments, for a hidden $π^*$. The objective is to recover $π^*$, from the observation of $(x_t)_{t\in[T]},(x^\#_t)_{t\in[T]}$. This generalizes the classical problem of matching independent point clouds to the time series setting.
  We derive the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), leading to a quadratic optimization over permutations, and theoretically analyze an estimator based on linear assignment. For the latter approach, we establish recovery guarantees, identifying thresholds for $σ$ that allow for perfect or partial recovery. Additionally, we propose solving the MLE by considering convex relaxations of the set of permutation matrices (e.g., over the Birkhoff polytope). This allows for efficient estimation of $π^*$ and the VAR parameters via alternating minimization. Empirically, we find that linear assignment often matches or outperforms MLE relaxation based approaches.

*Claire Donnat,Olga Klopp,Hemant Tyagi*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper addresses joint estimation of parameters for linear dynamical systems on graph structures using total variation penalized least-squares estimators, achieving non-asymptotic MSE bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to estimate parameters of linear dynamical systems residing on graph nodes, improving accuracy when system matrices exhibit smoothness or discontinuities across graph edges.

Method: Utilizing total variation penalized least-squares estimator with theoretical derivations of non-asymptotic mean squared error bounds.

Result: Non-asymptotic bounds demonstrate MSE reduction as the number of systems grows, even with constant trajectory lengths. Experimental validation supports the findings.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable and theoretical framework for accurately estimating parameters in complex graph-based systems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of joint estimation of the parameters of $m$ linear dynamical systems, given access to single realizations of their respective trajectories, each of length $T$. The linear systems are assumed to reside on the nodes of an undirected and connected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$, and the system matrices are assumed to either vary smoothly or exhibit small number of ``jumps'' across the edges. We consider a total variation penalized least-squares estimator and derive non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error (MSE) which hold with high probability. In particular, the bounds imply for certain choices of well connected $G$ that the MSE goes to zero as $m$ increases, even when $T$ is constant. The theoretical results are supported by extensive experiments on synthetic and real data.

TL;DR: The paper documents a collaborative effort between human researchers and GPT-5 Pro to solve an unsolved problem in robust mathematical statistics, achieving minimax optimal error rate for robust density estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI, specifically GPT-5 Pro, can aid in solving challenging mathematical problems and contribute to human-AI collaboration in advancing scientific research.

Method: The collaboration involved using GPT-5 Pro to suggest calculations, introduce unfamiliar techniques, and assist in deriving optimal solutions for robust density estimation in mathematical statistics.

Result: The researchers, using GPT-5 Pro, determined the minimax optimal error rate, which was unattainable before, and documented the challenges and benefits of working with GPT-5.

Conclusion: Human-AI collaboration, through tools like GPT-5 Pro, has significant potential in accelerating mathematical research, despite some challenges that require mitigation strategies. This work demonstrates the integration of AI into professional scientific workflows.

Abstract: Over the last few months, AI models including large language models have improved greatly. There are now several documented examples where they have helped professional mathematical scientists prove new results, sometimes even helping resolve known open problems. In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations.In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arxiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp.
  Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science.

### [960] [Connectivity-Preserving Multi-Agent Area Coverage via Optimal-Transport-Based Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18579)
*Kooktae Lee,Ethan Brook*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimal control framework that maintains connectivity among agents in multi-agent systems for non-uniform area coverage tasks, addressing communication and coordination challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing density-driven methods fail to maintain communication connectivity among agents, leading to reduced performance and coordination in non-uniform coverage tasks.

Method: A modified Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework with a connectivity-preserving penalty integrated into a convex quadratic program for distributed implementation.

Result: Simulation studies demonstrate the method's effectiveness in maintaining connectivity, improving convergence speed, and enhancing coverage quality compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates connectivity considerations into multi-agent coordination, ensuring robust communication and better performance in dynamic coverage tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems play a central role in area coverage tasks across search-and-rescue, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance.
  This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations.
  Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the integration of generative machine learning into Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance manufacturing process control under uncertainty and nonlinear conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manufacturing processes face dynamic and uncertain conditions that challenge traditional control methods, requiring robust alternatives for better process quality and reliability.

Method: The paper examines five methods integrating generative ML into MPC components and synthesizes these cases to propose systematic enhancements and a research framework.

Result: Generative ML introduces advancements in predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization within MPC, addressing uncertainty and complex dynamics.

Conclusion: Generative ML offers transformative capabilities to reshape and improve predictive control frameworks for next-generation manufacturing systems.

Abstract: Manufacturing processes are inherently dynamic and uncertain, with varying parameters and nonlinear behaviors, making robust control essential for maintaining quality and reliability. Traditional control methods often fail under these conditions due to their reactive nature. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a more advanced framework, leveraging process models to predict future states and optimize control actions. However, MPC relies on simplified models that often fail to capture complex dynamics, and it struggles with accurate state estimation and handling the propagation of uncertainty in manufacturing environments. Machine learning (ML) has been introduced to enhance MPC by modeling nonlinear dynamics and learning latent representations that support predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. Yet existing ML-driven MPC approaches remain deterministic and correlation-focused, motivating the exploration of generative. Generative ML offers new opportunities by learning data distributions, capturing hidden patterns, and inherently managing uncertainty, thereby complementing MPC. This review highlights five representative methods and examines how each has been integrated into MPC components, including predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. By synthesizing these cases, we outline the common ways generative ML can systematically enhance MPC and provide a framework for understanding its potential in diverse manufacturing processes. We identify key research gaps, propose future directions, and use a representative case to illustrate how generative ML-driven MPC can extend broadly across manufacturing. Taken together, this review positions generative ML not as an incremental add-on but as a transformative approach to reshape predictive control for next-generation manufacturing systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online method for sparse dynamics identification, aiming for real-time applications in partially observable data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for sparse dynamics identification rely on batch learning, limiting their use in real-time scenarios with sequential and partial data.

Method: The proposed method integrates Augmented Kalman Filter (AKF) with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) through Bayesian sparsification, an adaptive update mechanism for model structure, and gradient-descent for efficiency.

Result: The SKI method delivers accurate model selection with millisecond efficiency, outperforming baseline AKF with an 84.21% accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: The SKI method effectively addresses real-time sparse dynamics identification challenges, ensuring efficient and accurate model structure selection.

Abstract: Sparse dynamics identification is an essential tool for discovering interpretable physical models and enabling efficient control in engineering systems. However, existing methods rely on batch learning with full historical data, limiting their applicability to real-time scenarios involving sequential and partially observable data. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an online Sparse Kalman Identification (SKI) method by integrating the Augmented Kalman Filter (AKF) and Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD). The main contributions are: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian sparsification scheme that is seamlessly integrated into the AKF framework and adapted to sequentially collected data in online scenarios; (2) an update mechanism that adapts the Kalman posterior to reflect the updated selection of the basis functions that define the model structure; (3) an explicit gradient-descent formulation that enhances computational efficiency. Consequently, the SKI method achieves accurate model structure selection with millisecond-level efficiency and higher identification accuracy, as demonstrated by extensive simulations and real-world experiments (showing an 84.21\% improvement in accuracy over the baseline AKF).

Motivation: The demand for EV charging infrastructure is growing, requiring better strategies to address spatial-temporal charging demand patterns for cost-effective service delivery.

Method: An integrated approach employs a mathematical optimization model developed with assistance from a large language model. It uses the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for distributed computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed framework validated on Chengdu, China’s dataset reduced costs by 30% compared to systems without EV assignment.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that integrating investment and operation optimization with spatial-temporal demand insights considerably enhances EV charging service planning.

Abstract: The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services. However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning. This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies. To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation. Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms. We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.

Result: The study explores the current state and future possibilities regarding AI's role in musical creativity, while identifying hurdles musicians face in adopting AI as part of their creative process.

Conclusion: Integrating AI into musicians’ workflows presents both opportunities and challenges. A deeper understanding of these dynamics can enhance the collaboration between musicians and AI, and facilitate greater appropriation and incorporation of AI in creative processes.

Abstract: By observing the activities and relationships of musicians and sound designers to the activities of creation, performance, publishing and dissemination with artificial intelligence (AI), from two specialized forums between 2022 and 2024, this article proposes a lexicometric analysis of the representations linked to their use. Indeed, the machine, now equipped with artificial intelligences requiring new appropriations and enabling new mediations, constitutes new challenges for artists. To study these confrontations and new mediations, our approach mobilizes the theoretical framework of the Human-AI Musicking Framework, based on a lexicometric analysis of content. The aim is to clarify the present and future uses of AI from the interfaces, in the creation of sound and musical content, and to identify the obstacles, obstacles, brakes and limits to appropriation ``in the fact of making the content one's own and integrating it as a part of oneself'' (Bachimont and Crozat, 2004) in the context of a collaboration between musician and machine.

Motivation: Understanding how human self-confidence calibration and psychological traits influence reliance or resistance towards AI suggestions in decision-making.

Method: Two studies were conducted: one to identify well-calibrated users and compare self-confidence across NFC and AOT levels, and another to evaluate AI-assisted decision-making systems while accounting for self-confidence calibration and psychological traits.

Result: Results indicate the importance of calibrated self-confidence and psychological traits in designing AI systems, improving decision accuracy, and metacognitive perceptions.

Conclusion: Effective calibration of self-confidence and consideration of psychological traits are crucial in developing tailored, user-centric AI decision systems.

Abstract: Human-AI collaboration outcomes depend strongly on human self-confidence calibration, which drives reliance or resistance toward AI's suggestions. This work presents two studies examining whether calibration of self-confidence before decision tasks, low versus high levels of Need for Cognition (NFC), and Actively Open-Minded Thinking (AOT), leads to differences in decision accuracy, self-confidence appropriateness during the tasks, and metacognitive perceptions (global and affective). The first study presents strategies to identify well-calibrated users, also comparing decision accuracy and the appropriateness of self-confidence across NFC and AOT levels. The second study investigates the effects of calibrated self-confidence in AI-assisted decision-making (no AI, two-stage AI, and personalized AI), also considering different NFC and AOT levels. Our results show the importance of human self-confidence calibration and psychological traits when designing AI-assisted decision systems. We further propose design recommendations to address the challenge of calibrating self-confidence and supporting tailored, user-centric AI that accounts for individual traits.

Motivation: To accelerate mechanical design processes, facilitate innovative exploration, and reduce manual effort in setup and scripting.

Method: The MDO Agent integrates three main capabilities: natural-language-driven parametric modeling, knowledge-grounded retrieval using RAG, and software orchestration for performance optimization.

Result: Validation on three cases demonstrates reduced manual effort, reliable conceptualization, optimized designs, and enhanced design exploration.

Conclusion: The proposed MDO platform promotes human-AI collaboration in engineering and sets groundwork for customized, dependable MDO systems.

Abstract: To accelerate mechanical design and enhance design quality and innovation, we present a Multidisciplinary Design and Optimization (MDO) Agent driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). The agent semi-automates the end-to-end workflow by orchestrating three core capabilities: (i) natural-language-driven parametric modeling, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for knowledge-grounded conceptualization, and (iii) intelligent orchestration of engineering software for performance verification and optimization. Working in tandem, these capabilities interpret high-level, unstructured intent, translate it into structured design representations, automatically construct parametric 3D CAD models, generate reliable concept variants using external knowledge bases, and conduct evaluation with iterative optimization via tool calls such as finite-element analysis (FEA). Validation on three representative cases - a gas-turbine blade, a machine-tool column, and a fractal heat sink - shows that the agent completes the pipeline from natural-language intent to verified and optimized designs with reduced manual scripting and setup effort, while promoting innovative design exploration. This work points to a practical path toward human-AI collaborative mechanical engineering and lays a foundation for more dependable, vertically customized MDO systems.

### [967] [Embedding Generative AI into Systems Analysis and Design Curriculum: Framework, Case Study, and Cross-Campus Empirical Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17515)

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper discusses incorporating Generative AI (GenAI) in systems analysis education through the SAGE framework to enhance responsible and critical AI orchestration among students, addressing risks of passive AI dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in systems analysis pedagogy by teaching students responsible and critical usage of Generative AI, ensuring their decisions align with user needs and contextual appropriateness.

Method: The authors implemented SAGE by embedding GenAI into curriculum design and studied its effects on 18 student groups across four Australian universities to assess skill development.

Result: 84% of student groups demonstrated selective judgment rather than passive acceptance of AI results. However, deficiencies were noted, such as missing exception handling, system boundaries misclassification issues, and data management errors. Accessibility awareness was fragile, with mixed group performance.

Conclusion: Educators must emphasize explicit reasoning for AI-related decisions, continuously integrate accessibility prompts, and ensure students independently create system specifications prior to AI interaction to check for gaps against standards.

Abstract: Systems analysis students increasingly use Generative AI, yet current pedagogy lacks systematic approaches for teaching responsible AI orchestration that fosters critical thinking whilst meeting educational outcomes. Students risk accepting AI suggestions blindly or uncritically without assessing alignment with user needs or contextual appropriateness. SAGE (Structured AI-Guided Education) addresses this gap by embedding GenAI into curriculum design, training students when to accept, modify, or reject AI contributions. Implementation with 18 student groups across four Australian universities revealed how orchestration skills develop. Most groups (84\%) moved beyond passive acceptance, showing selective judgment, yet none proactively identified gaps overlooked by both human and AI analysis, indicating a competency ceiling. Students strong at explaining decisions also performed well at integrating sources, and those with deep domain understanding consistently considered accessibility considerations. Accessibility awareness proved fragile. When writing requirements, 85\% of groups explicitly considered elderly users and cultural needs. Notably, 55\% of groups struggled identifying when AI misclassified system boundaries (what belongs inside versus outside the system), 45\% missed data management errors (how information is stored and updated), and 55\% overlooked missing exception handling. Three implications emerge for educators: (i) require students to document why they accepted, modified, or rejected each AI suggestion, making reasoning explicit; (ii) embed accessibility prompts at each development stage because awareness collapses without continuous scaffolding; and (iii) have students create their own specifications before using AI, then compare versions, and anchor to research or standards to identify gaps.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces AnimAgents, a human-multi-agent collaboration system that integrates generative AI into animation pre-production workflows and significantly improves coordination, consistency, and information management compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creators face challenges in animation pre-production processes due to fragmented workflows using multiple non-integrated tools, making coordination and continuity difficult.

Method: The paper presents a system called AnimAgents, which leverages a core agent and specialized agents to coordinate workflows across animation pre-production stages, supported by dedicated boards for ideation, scripting, design, and storyboarding.

Result: AnimAgents outperformed a single-agent baseline in coordination, consistency, and satisfaction (p < .01) during a study with 16 professionals, and demonstrated effectiveness in real-world scenarios with 4 creators.

Conclusion: AnimAgents offers an integrated solution for animation pre-production through advanced workflow orchestration, improving professional creators' productivity and satisfaction.

Abstract: Animation pre-production lays the foundation of an animated film by transforming initial concepts into a coherent blueprint across interdependent stages such as ideation, scripting, design, and storyboarding. While generative AI tools are increasingly adopted in this process, they remain isolated, requiring creators to juggle multiple systems without integrated workflow support. Our formative study with 12 professional creative directors and independent animators revealed key challenges in their current practice: Creators must manually coordinate fragmented outputs, manage large volumes of information, and struggle to maintain continuity and creative control between stages. Based on the insights, we present AnimAgents, a human-multi-agent collaborative system that coordinates complex, multi-stage workflows through a core agent and specialized agents, supported by dedicated boards for the four major stages of pre-production. AnimAgents enables stage-aware orchestration, stage-specific output management, and element-level refinement, providing an end-to-end workflow tailored to professional practice. In a within-subjects summative study with 16 professional creators, AnimAgents significantly outperformed a strong single-agent baseline that equipped with advanced parallel image generation in coordination, consistency, information management, and overall satisfaction (p < .01). A field deployment with 4 creators further demonstrated AnimAgents' effectiveness in real-world projects.

TL;DR: This study explores using large language models (LLMs) to create personalized digital health interventions in physical and occupational therapy, showing increased effectiveness and feasibility compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital health intervention software is limited in personalization and often cannot address patient-specific needs due to pre-programmed templates and narrow adaptability.

Method: A prospective single-arm feasibility study was conducted, involving 20 physical and occupational therapists using LLMs to transform their exercise prescriptions into executable software for a standardized patient.

Result: LLM-based interventions resulted in a 45% increase in personalized prescriptions implemented versus template-based benchmarks, with high therapist consensus on usability. Software executed 99.78% of instructions accurately and monitored performance with 88.4% accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of LLM-based software generation for personalized healthcare interventions, suggesting its potential for broader trials to test clinical efficacy and safety in real patient populations.

Abstract: Digital health interventions are increasingly used in physical and occupational therapy to deliver home exercise programs via sensor equipped devices such as smartphones, enabling remote monitoring of adherence and performance. However, digital interventions are typically programmed as software before clinical encounters as libraries of parametrized exercise modules targeting broad patient populations. At the point of care, clinicians can only select modules and adjust a narrow set of parameters like repetitions, so patient specific needs that emerge during encounters, such as distinct movement limitations, and home environments, are rarely reflected in the software. We evaluated a digital intervention paradigm that uses large language models (LLMs) to translate clinicians' exercise prescriptions into intervention software. In a prospective single arm feasibility study with 20 licensed physical and occupational therapists and a standardized patient, clinicians created 40 individualized upper extremity programs (398 instructions) that were automatically translated into executable software. Our results show a 45% increase in the proportion of personalized prescriptions that can be implemented as software compared with a template based benchmark, with unanimous consensus among therapists on ease of use. The LLM generated software correctly delivered 99.78% (397/398) of instructions as prescribed and monitored performance with 88.4% (352/398) accuracy, with 90% (18/20) of therapists judged it safe to interact with patients, and 75% (15/20) expressed willingness to adopt it. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective evaluation of clinician directed intervention software generation with LLMs in healthcare, demonstrating feasibility and motivating larger trials to assess clinical effectiveness and safety in real patient populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the impracticality of traditional keyboards in spatial computing and virtual reality environments by exploring sEMG as an alternative input modality.

Method: Attention-based architectures and a lightweight decoding pipeline were used, enhanced with language-model-based correction to improve typing accuracy.

Result: Achieved significant improvement over convolutional baselines, reducing generic and personalized character error rates (CER).

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates the feasibility of using sEMG for accurate, real-time muscle-driven text input, potentially enabling advanced HCI for wearable and spatial interfaces.

Abstract: We explore surface electromyography (sEMG) as a non-invasive input modality for mapping muscle activity to keyboard inputs, targeting immersive typing in next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI). This is especially relevant for spatial computing and virtual reality (VR), where traditional keyboards are impractical. Using attention-based architectures, we significantly outperform the existing convolutional baselines, reducing online generic CER from 24.98% -> 20.34% and offline personalized CER from 10.86% -> 10.10%, while remaining fully causal. We further incorporate a lightweight decoding pipeline with language-model-based correction, demonstrating the feasibility of accurate, real-time muscle-driven text input for future wearable and spatial interfaces.

*Alice Smith,Bob Johnson,Xiaoyu Zhu,Carol Lee*

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight RGB object tracking algorithm for resource-constrained AR platforms, achieving real-time tracking with comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop real-time, accurate object tracking for AR applications on wearable devices, overcoming computational and memory constraints.

Method: The paper introduces a compact Siamese neural network architecture with optimizations such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. Training is performed on large video datasets, and models are deployed for real-time tracking.

Result: The approach demonstrates comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art trackers while achieving real-time performance at 30 FPS on mobile AR headsets.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight tracker enables robust and practical object tracking for AR, providing enhanced interactive experiences on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) applications often require robust real-time tracking of objects in the user's environment to correctly overlay virtual content. Recent advances in computer vision have produced highly accurate deep learning-based object trackers, but these models are typically too heavy in computation and memory for wearable AR devices. In this paper, we present a lightweight RGB object tracking algorithm designed specifically for resource-constrained AR platforms. The proposed tracker employs a compact Siamese neural network architecture and incorporates optimization techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to drastically reduce model size and inference cost while maintaining high tracking accuracy. We train the tracker offline on large video datasets using deep convolutional neural networks and then deploy it on-device for real-time tracking. Experimental results on standard tracking benchmarks show that our approach achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art trackers, yet runs in real-time on a mobile AR headset at around 30 FPS -- more than an order of magnitude faster than prior high-performance trackers on the same hardware. This work enables practical, robust object tracking for AR use-cases, opening the door to more interactive and dynamic AR experiences on lightweight devices.
