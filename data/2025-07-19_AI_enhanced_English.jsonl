To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the\nsame for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when\nassessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes norm-adaptive MMD (NAMMD) as an enhancement to maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for improved distribution closeness testing (DCT) and demonstrates its theoretical and experimental advantages over MMD.", "motivation": "Current DCT methods focus on discrepancies in discrete, one-dimensional spaces, limiting their applicability to complex data types such as images, and MMD is less informative for assessing closeness levels across multiple pairs of distributions.", "method": "The authors introduce NAMMD, a novel measurement scaling MMD values using the RKHS norms of distributions, and propose NAMMD-based DCT leveraging its asymptotic distribution for effectively assessing distribution closeness.", "result": "NAMMD-based DCT is shown to have higher test power and bounded type-I error compared to MMD-based DCT, validated through extensive experiments across various data types, and it also improves the two-sample testing problem.", "conclusion": "NAMMD enhances the capability and test power of MMD for both distribution closeness testing and two-sample testing, providing a theoretically robust and experimentally validated approach for complex data types."}}
