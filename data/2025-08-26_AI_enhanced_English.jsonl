To make sure that the data replicas are\nup-to-date, they need to synchronize, which typically means engaging the\nreplicas in waiting for coherent responses from each other. The amount of\nwaiting depends on the consistency and availability guarantees we impose on the\nsystem. The folklore CAP theory states that strong consistency (the set of\nreplicas create an illusion of one correct server) and strong availability (the\nreplicas' states are reachable despite network partitions) cannot be\nimplemented in the same system. A popular way to deal with this impossibility\nis to relax consistency to be only eventual: the replicas eventually converge\nto the same state. In return, the replicas can be wait-free, i.e., the clients\ncan get the data from the closest replica without waiting for other ones.\n  Wait-free data replication faces two important challenges. First, the\noperations issued by the clients may be constantly revoked, i.e., their effects\ncan be repeatedly recomputed due to asynchrony and concurrency.

Usually, approaches to\nuncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights\ncannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss\nfunctions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very\ngeneral definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even\ngenerative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that\nconnect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration\nwith proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework.

Together, these resources contribute to the ABSA community and\neducation domain by removing the dataset barrier, supporting research\ntransparency and reproducibility, and enabling the creation and sharing of\nfurther resources.

However, many conventional methods assume a fixed-shape\ndistribution (typically Gaussian), and resort to estimating distribution\nparameters. This assumption is often restrictive, as real-world target\ndistributions can be highly complex. To overcome this limitation, we introduce\nTabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for\nunivariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like\nRealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow\nconsists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical\nfeature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature\nextraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and\ntractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark\ndatasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic\nregression models on likelihood scores.

We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel\nmultimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in\nmedical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation\nof our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack\nenvironment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic\nknowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting,\nwe introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds\nsubtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports.\nThese mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal\nalignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters.\nWhile basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI\ndemonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR\nQA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and\nlowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%.

To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an\nefficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and\nfusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the\ninherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and\nlanguage models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it\ndynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic\ngranularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The\nfused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being\ndirectly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding\nlayer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also\ndynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small\nnumber of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of\ncross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted\nexperiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering\non ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions.

We introduce\na single spacial light modulator (SLM)-centric primitive that realizes, in one\nstroke, all-optical k-local Ising interactions and fully optical\nKolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) layers. The central idea is to convert\nstructural nonlinearity of a nominally linear photonic scatterer into a\nper-window computational resource by adding one relay pass through the same\nspatial light modulator. A folded 4f relay reimages the first Fourier plane\nonto the SLM so that each chosen spin clique or ridge channel occupies a\ndisjoint window with its own second-pass phase patch. Propagation remains\nlinear in the optical field, yet the measured intensity in each window becomes\na freely programmable polynomial of the clique sum or projection amplitude.\nThis yields native, per-clique k-local couplings without nonlinear media and,\nin parallel, the many independent univariate nonlinearities required by KAN\nlayers, all with in-situ physical gradients for training using two-frame\n(forward and adjoint) physical gradients. We outline implementation on spatial\nphotonic Ising machines, injection-locked VCSEL arrays, and the Microsoft\nanalog optical computers.
